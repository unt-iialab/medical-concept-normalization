0,arthrotec searle is a new concept in nsaid therapy that provides powerful anti inflammatory efficacy with enhanced upper gi safety
1,arthrotec comprises an enteric coated core of diclofenac sodium mg surrounded by a mantle of misoprostol mcg
2,two multicentre trials evaluated the efficacy of arthrotec in rheumatoid arthritis ra and osteoarthritis oa patients who were randomised to receive either arthrotec or diclofenac
3,the results of all arthritis assessments showed arthrotec to be as effective as diclofenac in treating the signs and symptoms of ra and oa
4,two endoscopic studies compared the antiarthritic efficacy and gastroduodenal safety of arthrotec and diclofenac
5,in a week study of ra patients the antiarthritic efficacy of arthrotec was equivalent to diclofenac in addition fewer patients taking arthrotec experienced ulcers than did those taking diclofenac arthrotec vs diclofenac p
6,in a week study of oa patients arthrotec s efficacy was equivalent to that of diclofenac and the arthrotec group developed no ulcers while of the diclofenac group had ulcers p
7,in a trial conducted to compare the efficacy and upper gastroduodenal safety of arthrotec with those of piroxicam and naproxen patients with oa received either arthrotec bid piroxicam mg bid or naproxen bid for weeks
8,arthritis assessments showed arthrotec to be at least as effective as piroxicam and naproxen in treating oa
9,post treatment endoscopy data indicated that gastroduodenal ulcers developed in of patients receiving arthrotec of patients receiving piroxicam and patients in the naproxen group
10,abstract truncated at words
11,a week multicenter double masked placebo controlled parallel group study compared the upper gastrointestinal ugi safety of arthrotec diclofenac sodium mg misoprostol microg g d searle co skokie illinois administered twice daily with that of nabumetone mg administered once daily in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis oa of the hip or knee
12,all patients had a documented clinical history of endoscopically confirmed gastric pyloric channel or duodenal ulcer or or erosions in the stomach or duodenum
13,ugi endoscopy was performed at baseline and again at week or early withdrawal
14,treatment with arthrotec resulted in a significantly lower combined incidence of endoscopically confirmed gastric and duodenal ulcers compared with nabumetone vs and its rate of endoscopically confirmed ulceration was equivalent to that of placebo
15,the incidence of gastric ulcers alone was also significantly lower with arthrotec than with nabumetone vs
16,the incidence of duodenal ulcer with arthrotec was not significantly different from that with nabumetone vs
17,types of adverse events were similar for all treatment groups with gi adverse events predominating
18,arthrotec was well tolerated by the majority of patients
19,the results of this study demonstrate that arthrotec has a superior ugi safety profile causing significantly fewer ugi ulcers in comparison with nabumetone in patients with symptomatic oa and a documented history of ulcers or or erosions
20,this article examines the most recently published scientific literature on arthritis therapy options and available mucosal protective agents
21,emphasis is placed on the risks of current nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid therapy the options for reducing such risks and the published information that either supports or refutes current thinking in these areas
22,a comprehensive evaluation is made of clinical data related to the use of arthrotec diclofenac misoprostol in the treatment of arthritis
23,a recent meta analysis of the prophylaxis of nsaid associated upper gastrointestinal complications is reviewed
24,the results of this meta analysis should help to consolidate much of the current scientific literature on the safe and effective treatment of arthritis
25,to identify the unbiased differences in the risk of hospitalization with peptic ulcer disease pud or gastrointestinal gi hemorrhage among populations using nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid nabumetone arthrotec diclofenac plus a cytoprotective agent dispensed separately diclo corx and naproxen
26,a population based historical cohort study using linked data from provincial healthcare databases
27,the population of the province of saskatchewan canada entitled to drug plan benefits in was eligible roughly of million people
28,participants were identified if they filled a prescription for one of the study nsaid individuals
29,they were then followed for months to determine outcomes
30,logistic regression was used to produce estimates of the risk of admission to hospital with a primary diagnosis of pud or gi hemorrhage associated with the study drugs unbiased by known confounders
31,compared to arthrotec the adjusted odds of hospitalization for pud for participants taking nabumetone was ci diclo corx ci and naproxen ci
32,compared to nabumetone the adjusted odds of hospitalization for pud for participants taking diclo corx was ci and naproxen ci
33,no significant differences were noted in terms of admissions for gi hemorrhage
34,participants taking nabumetone and arthrotec had significantly lower risk of hospitalization for pud than those taking the other study drugs
35,arthrotec was superior to nabumetone in a head to head comparison and especially when compared with the diclo corx and naproxen groups
36,no short term differences were seen in the rates of admission for gi hemorrhage
37,it appears that inherent gastroprotective strategies with arthrotec and to a lesser extent with nabumetone do translate into decreased serious gi side effects at the population level in the short term
38,arthrotec a combination tablet has been developed that contains mg of diclofenac in an inner core and micrograms of misoprostol in an outer mantle
39,both diclofenac and misoprostol are extensively absorbed and their maximum plasma concentrations but not total availability are diminished when taken with food
40,both drugs have elimination half lives of less than hours and do not accumulate in plasma after recommended doses
41,pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of the combination product taken separately and together reveal a high between and within subject variability in plasma diclofenac levels especially when the enteric coated tablets were given after food reliable values for peak plasma diclofenac concentration could not be ascertained
42,no pharmacokinetic interactions between diclofenac and misoprostol were apparent
43,the bioavailability of diclofenac and misoprostol from the combination tablet was similar to that seen when the two drugs are given separately
44,two double blind comparative studies were conducted to determine the upper gastrointestinal safety of arthrotec a combination of mg of diclofenac and micrograms of misoprostol versus mg of diclofenac
45,in one study rheumatoid arthritis patients were randomly given arthrotec or diclofenac or times daily for weeks
46,endoscopy was performed before and after treatment
47,at the termination of treatment among the patients with rheumatoid arthritis gastroduodenal ulcers were found in of the arthrotec treated patients and in of the diclofenac treated patients p
48,in the second study osteoarthritis patients were randomly given arthrotec or diclofenac or times daily for weeks
49,endoscopy was performed before and after treatment
50,among the patients with osteoarthritis gastroduodenal ulcers were found in none of the arthrotec patients and in of the diclofenac patients p
51,to identify the unbiased differences in all cause mortality among populations using non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid nabumetone arthrotec diclofenac plus a cytoprotective agent dispensed separately diclofenac and naproxen
52,we performed a population based historical cohort study using linked data from several provincial health care databases
53,logistic regression was used to produce estimates of the mortality associated with the study drugs unbiased by known confounders
54,the entire population of the province of saskatchewan canada entitled to drug plan benefits in was eligible approximately of million people
55,participants were identified if they filled a prescription for one of the study nsaid individuals
56,they were then followed forward in time for months to determine all cause mortality
57,compared to nabumetone the adjusted odds of death for participants taking arthrotec was confidence interval ci for diclofenac and naproxen
58,the multivariate analysis showed patients taking nabumetone and arthrotec had significantly lower mortality than those taking other study drugs
59,nabumetone had to the mortality associated with the diclofenac and naproxen groups
60,it appears that inherent gastroprotective strategies in the study nsaid may translate into decreased mortality at the population level
61,to compare the incidence of selected spontaneously reported adverse events aes in patients with osteoarthritis oa treated with rofecoxib vioxx mg qd or arthrotec diclofenac mg misoprostol mcg bid
62,double blind parallel group week study of patients aged or years with a clinical diagnosis of oa treated with rofecoxib or arthrotec
63,primary endpoint self reported diarrhea secondary endpoints abdominal pain discontinuations due to aes gi aes and nsaid type gi aes ie acid reflux dyspepsia epigastric discomfort heartburn nausea vomiting
64,among patients females mean age the rofecoxib group vs the arthrotec group respectively reported diarrhea vs p drug related diarrhea vs p one or more clinical aes vs p gi aes vs p nsaid type gi aes vs p discontinuations due to abdominal pain vs p and discontinuations due to any ae vs p
65,no significant differences were observed in efficacy
66,rofecoxib mg qd has improved gi tolerability and similar efficacy compared to arthrotec diclofenac mg misoprostol mcg bid
67,to assess the balance between costs and upper gastrointestinal gi side effects of treatment with celecoxib nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids alone nsaid plus misoprostol nsaid plus histamine receptor antagonist h ra nsaid plus proton pump inhibitor ppi and arthrotec in the netherlands
68,a model was used to convene data from various sources on the probability of gi side effects and resource use
69,the probabilities of gi side effects for celecoxib and nsaids alone were derived from trial data
70,calculations were based on months of treatment and were from a societal perspective
71,distinction was made between low medium and high risk patients
72,an extensive probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to address uncertainty
73,assuming an average patient the total costs per months of therapy were celecoxib euro nsaids alone euro nsaid plus misoprostol euro nsaid plus h ra euro nsaid plus ppi euro and arthrotec euro
74,treatment with celecoxib was associated with the lowest number of gi side effects and related deaths
75,incremental costs per life year saved for arthrotec compared to nsaids alone were euro for all patients and euro for medium to high risk patients whereas for high risk patients arthrotec dominated nsaid alone
76,for celecoxib compared to arthrotec the incremental cost effectiveness ratios icers were euro euro and euro respectively
77,assuming a limit of euro per life year gained from an economic point of view arthrotec is the preferred treatment when all patients or medium to high risk patients are considered
78,in high risk patients celecoxib is the preferred treatment strategy
79,in a double blind study patients with osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to receive a combination of arthrotec mg of diclofenac and micrograms of misoprostol or mg of diclofenac the drugs were given two or three times daily for weeks
80,at weeks and of treatment no significant differences between the treatment groups were noted in changes from baseline on the physicians and patients global assessment of osteoarthritis
81,on a measure of arthritis severity patients with both arthritis of the hip and knee showed improvement from week to week with no significant differences between treatment groups
82,data from four double blind studies of the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis were combined
83,for to weeks patients received arthrotec a combination of mg of diclofenac and micrograms of misoprostol and patients received mg of diclofenac the drugs were given twice or three times daily
84,the five most commonly reported adverse events were abdominal pain by of the diclofenac misoprostol patients and of the diclofenac patients diarrhea by and nausea by and dyspepsia by and and flatulence by and
85,other adverse events reported by similar proportions of both treatment groups included headache gastritis dizziness vomiting and constipation
86,in the diclofenac misoprostol treated patients the abdominal pain and diarrhea were rated mild in and moderate in and and severe in and
87,serious adverse events occurred in eight of the diclofenac misoprostol treated patients and in of the diclofenac treated patients and respectively were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events
88,results of laboratory tests of hepatic and renal function were similar in the two treatment groups
89,in a double blind study patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to receive arthrotec a combination of mg of diclofenac and g of misoprostol or mg of diclofenac the drugs were given two or three times daily for weeks
90,at weeks and of treatment no clinically significant differences between the two treatment groups were noted on measures of joint tenderness pain and swelling or on physicians and patients assessments of disease severity
91,to try arthrotek a combined drug in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra
92,ra women aged to years with endoscopically verified minimal affection of gastroduodenal mucosa not more than hemorrhages and or erosions received arthrotek tablet times a day for months
93,the efficacy was judged by changes in the joints and gastroduodenal lesions
94,the month treatment produced positive changes in the main auricular and gastroduodenal symptoms
95,side effects head ache diarrhea sleepiness disappeared after reducing the day dose to tablets
96,arthrotek proved highly effective against ra
97,it is also a good gastroprotector promoting healing of gastroduodenal erosions
98,a clinical trial of arthrotek searle in ra patients aged years demonstrated its high anti inflammatory activity in of them
99,these patients have received a complete treatment course patients were not included in the overall estimations because of side affects gastric pains and nausea causing them to withdraw early in the treatment course patients were nonresponders
100,the responders experienced attenuation of joint pain morning stiffness
101,inflammation in some joints declined the articular index decreased
102,arthrotec at is a combination of diclofenac a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and misoprostol mp a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin e pge
103,mp is a lipophilic methyl ester prodrug
104,it is readily metabolized to the biologically active misoprostol acid mpa
105,during the last few years medical studies exhibited mp to be an excellent abortive
106,in this paper we describe a rare criminal case of mp abortion initiated by the expectant father
107,after the abortion samples of vomit and urine were collected
108,systemic exposure to mp is difficult to prove because both mp and the active metabolite mpa are hardly excreted in urine
109,therefore in addition to routine toxicological analysis we used slightly modified well established liquid and gas chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric lc ms ms and gc ms ms methods for the direct and the indirect detection of mpa and its metabolites
110,in this case we were able to demonstrate the presence of the major mp metabolites dinor mpa and tetranor mpa in the urine of the victim
111,we also detected paracetamol methoxyparacetamol and diclofenac glucuronide in the urine
112,in the vomit of the victim we detected diclofenac and mpa
113,these results combined with the criminal investigations showed that the accused had mixed mp into the food of his pregnant girlfriend
114,finally these investigations contributed to a confession of the accused
115,a year old female presented with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis
116,additional conditions and symptoms included raynaud syndrome fatigue irritable bowel syndrome associated constipation ibs c gastroesophageal reflux gerd menopausal symptoms chronic urinary tract and upper respiratory infections and weight gain
117,she was taking arthrotec a combination of diclofenac and misoprostol for pain and inflammation fosamax plus d alendronate with vitamin d recently prescribed because of low bone density and catapres clonidine for menopausal symptoms
118,against the advice of her rheumatologist she had recently discontinued taking plaquenil hydroxychloroquine methotrexate and prednisone due to significant side effects
119,lab tests to identify underlying imbalances and to direct treatment were ordered
120,treatment included dietary nutritional hormonal and mind body support
121,after one year of therapy the patient experienced improvement with all of her presenting conditions and symptoms which enabled her to discontinue several medications
122,she became versed in identifying and avoiding the environmental triggers of her disease including foods dairy wheat eggs and soy molds and emotional stress
123,antinuclear antibodies were normalized
124,she experienced a percent improvement in left trochanteric bone density comparable to bisphosphonate therapy
125,mild improvements were also noted in the spine and bilateral femoral neck
126,lack of efficacy or tolerability of some non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids may lead to switching between non selective nsaids nsnsaids and cyclooxygenase cox selective inhibitors coxibs potentially increasing treatment costs due to additional physician visits and wastage of medication
127,this study assessed drug switching and associated costs among elderly chronic nsaid users
128,data for patients who filled their first prescription for a coxib or nsnsaid in were obtained from the quebec health insurance agency
129,follow up was terminated at the earliest of yr the first day without nsaid exposure following the index filling date or death
130,patients could switch nsaids several times during follow up
131,person days of exposure were categorized by the nsaid most recently dispensed rofecoxib celecoxib arthrotec r or non arthrotec na nsnsaid
132,cox regression models compared time to switch between groups adjusting for patient baseline characteristics
133,upon a switch pills remaining from the previous prescription were considered wasted
134,the costs of wasted pills and switch associated physician visits were estimated
135,throughout follow up patients filled prescriptions for rofecoxib for celecoxib for arthrotec and for na nsnsaids
136,adjusted hazard ratios confidence interval for switching versus na nsnsaids were rofecoxib celecoxib
137,compared with na nsnsaid prescriptions adjusted switching related healthcare costs were and lower on average for rofecoxib and celecoxib prescriptions respectively
138,these costs were higher for arthrotec prescriptions than for na nsnsaids
139,compared with recipients of nsnsaids coxib recipients were less likely to switch medications and had approximately half the adjusted costs for switching related wasted resources per prescription
140,gastric gu and duodenal ulcers du are common adverse effects of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid
141,endoscopically diagnosed upper gastrointestinal gi ulceration occurs in about of longterm nsaid users
142,coadministration of misoprostol with the nsaid reduces the incidence of nsaid induced gu and du and their complications
143,however compliance is limited by the different dosing regimens of misoprostol and nsaid and gi symptoms associated with misoprostol at its recommended q i d
145,we compared the efficacy safety and incidence of endoscopic upper gi ulceration associated with the administration of combinations of diclofenac or mg and misoprostol microg d m t i d d m b i d
146,diclofenac mg b i d and placebo in a week randomized double blind study in patients with osteoarthritis oa of the knee or hip
147,a total of patients with symptomatic oa of the knee or hip and history of gu du
148,or or more erosions were randomized to receive d m t i d d m b i d diclofenac mg b i d or placebo for weeks
149,arthritis assessments were performed at baseline and weeks and upper gi endoscopies at baseline and end of treatment
150,all active treatment groups were significantly better than placebo at all visits in improving oa symptoms
151,there were no significant differences in arthritis efficacy between the diclofenac misoprostol combinations and diclofenac
152,however endoscopically diagnosed gu and or du were significantly less frequent in patients receiving d m t i d
154,and placebo compared to diclofenac mg b i d
156,adverse events were not different between the active treatment groups except for higher incidences of flatulence with d m and diarrhea with d m
157,diclofenac mg misoprostol microg t i d
158,and diclofenac mg misoprostol microg b i d
159,are as efficacious as diclofenac mg b i d
160,in the treatment of oa but are associated with a significantly lower incidence of gastric and or duodenal ulcers
161,the goal of this study was to objectively quantify cervical stiffness in misoprostol users prior to iuc insertion and at follow up consultation to evaluate the feasibility of assessing cervical stiffness and to study the influence of misoprostol on cervical softening
162,this was a cross sectional study that evaluated women who wished to use the lng ius
163,these women were evaluated immediately before lng ius insertion and weeks later at follow up consultation
164,participants received g of misoprostol combined with mg of diclofenac in a single tablet orally arthrotec forte pfizer usa h prior to insertion in off label use
165,on both occasions cervical stiffness was determined using a novel medical device based on the aspiration technique
166,the wilcoxon rank sum and the wilcoxon signed rank test were applied to compare cervical stiffness assessments at insertion of the iud and at follow up
167,for the first time cervical stiffness was quantitatively assessed in misoprostol users prior to iud insertion proving that the aspiration technique enables detection of pharmacologically induced cervical changes and also that misoprostol has a detectable softening effect on cervical tissue
168,the clinical value of the detected cervical softening after misoprostol administration remains unclear
169,aspiration measurements could be helpful in searching for the ideal candidate the appropriate route dosage and interval of misoprostol intake prior to iuc insertion
170,drug developers are grappling with the impact of personalized medicine on their portfolios
171,the combination of molecular diagnostics with targeted biologic therapies has been hailed as a recent innovation with few historical analogs to guide behavior
172,however if the definition of companion diagnostics is broadened to include any drug whose fda approved label requires diagnostic testing before prescription then over drugs across multiple therapeutic areas arise
173,most importantly for current drug developers these drugs represent a wide variety of market situations and with sufficient historical data to evaluate different commercialization strategies for the combination
174,included in these examples are drugs which were not initially launched with companion diagnostics but were required to implement companion diagnostics after they were on the market for a period of time
175,the historical case studies demonstrate that companion diagnostics are neither a universal panacea nor an unmitigated disaster for drug developers but require an understanding of specific situations to determine the utility of companion diagnostics
176,numerous case studies highlight how companion diagnostics have been a boon to drug developers including iressa statins soriatane arthrotec promacta nplate letairis and tracleer
177,other examples provide lessons on how to avoid pitfalls such as accutane ticlid tegretol ziagen actigall and clozaril
178,by carefully evaluating these case studies drug developers can gain insight on the appropriate companion diagnostic strategy to implement for their specific situation and develop the elements of a successful companion diagnostic strategy
179,osteoarthritis oa is the most common form of arthritis
180,published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen also called paracetamol or tylenol and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids as first line pharmacologic therapy
181,the comparative safety of acetaminophen and nsaids is important to consider as nsaids have the potential for serious gastrointestinal renal and cardiovascular toxicities and acetaminophen in high dosages greater than or equal to grams per day may also have the potential for serious upper gastrointestinal toxicity
182,to assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus nsaids ibuprofen arthrotec celecoxib naproxen rofecoxib for treating oa
183,we searched the cochrane controlled trials register issue medline up to july and current contents up to march
184,reference lists of identified rcts and pertinent review articles were also hand searched
185,published randomized controlled trials rcts evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in oa were considered for inclusion
186,pain physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported
187,results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences
188,dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk and the number needed to treat was calculated
189,six rcts and participants were included in the review
190,one study compared acetaminophen to placebo and five compared acetaminophen to nsaids
191,in the placebo controlled rct acetaminophen was shown to be clearly superior to placebo with a similar safety profile
192,the number needed to treat to achieve an improvement in pain was three
193,in the comparator controlled rcts acetaminophen was less effective overall than nsaids in terms of pain reduction and global assessments but both drugs had similar efficacy in terms of improvements in functional status
194,no significant difference was found between the safety of acetaminophen and nsaids although patients taking nsaids were more likely to withdraw due to gi events
195,the evidence to date suggests that nsaids are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with oa but have not been shown to be superior in improving function
196,the size of the treatment effect was modest and the mean trial duration was only six weeks therefore additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or nsaids
197,in oa subjects with moderate to severe levels of pain nsaids appear to be more effective than acetaminophen
198,a systematic review on the cost effectiveness of prophylactic treatments of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid induced gastropathy in patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis was conducted
199,two reviewers conducted the literature search and the review
200,both full and partial economic evaluations published in english dutch or german were included
201,the criteria list published in the textbook of drummond was used to determine the quality of the economic evaluations
202,the methodological quality of three randomised controlled trials rcts in which the economic evaluations obtained probability estimates of nsaid induced gastropathy and adverse events was assessed by a list of internal validity criteria
203,the conclusions were based on a rating system consisting of four levels of evidence
204,ten economic evaluations were included three were based on rcts
205,all evaluations studied misoprostol as prophylactic treatment in one evaluation misoprostol was studied as a fixed component in a combination with diclofenac arthrotec
206,all economic evaluations comprised analytical studies containing a decision tree
207,the three trials were of high methodological quality
208,nine economic evaluations were considered high quality and one economic evaluation was considered of low methodological quality
209,there is strong evidence level a that the use of misoprostol for the prevention of nsaid induced gastropathy is cost effective and limited evidence level c that the use of arthrotec is cost effective
210,although the levels of evidence used in this review are arbitrary it is believed that a qualitative analysis is useful quantitative analyses in this field are hampered by the heterogeneity of economic evaluations
211,existing criteria to evaluate the methodological quality of economic evaluations may need refinement for use in systematic reviews
212,the prohypertensive effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids can be manifested by the decreased efficiency of antihypertensive therapy
213,the tactics of their differential use in relation to the its effect on blood pressure bp in patients with osteoarthrosis oa and arterial hypertension ah has not been developed for the most effective and safe therapy
214,in this connection it is extremely urgent to study the comparative safety of used nsaids as to their prohypertensive effect and to work out the management of patients with ah and oa
215,ninety eight patients with second third degree oa of the knee and hip joints concurrent with the pain syndrome and first second grade ah were followed up
216,diclofenac ketoprofen arthrotec nimesulide and meloxicam were used
217,in a control group the analgesic tramadol was supplemented to the therapy
218,ah was controlled by enalapril monotherapy
219,in groups of patients receiving diclofenac arthrotec meloxicam and ketoprofen there was a trend for the number of cases of an adequate nocturnal bp lowering dipper to reduce and for those of an inadequate nocturnal bp decrease non dipper which may be accounted for by the prohypertensive effect of these drugs this trend was most pronounced in the diclofenac and arthrotec groups
220,despite its marked prohypertensive effect nimesulide did not impair circadian bp variations
221,the central acting analgesic tramadol exerted no prohypertensive effect and it did not increase bp values
222,the prohypertensive effect of the tested nsaids and tramadol increases in the following order tramadol ketoprofen meloxicam nimesulide arthrotec diclofenac
223,this study was conducted to assess the feasibility of cox nsaid substitution for aspirin for preventative therapy related to circulating anticoagulants as manifest by inhibition of platelet aggregation
224,there was no difference in platelet aggregation inhibition between aspirin naproxen ketoprofen or diclofenac and misoprostol in combination in the form of arthrotec
225,as cox nsaids appear equivalent in platelet inhibition efficacy to aspirin therapeutic regimens can be simplified in those individuals who require an nsaid for other problems
226,further despite its short serum halflife arthrotec appears as effective as an antiplatelet agent
227,controlled double blind studies of efficacy in blocking clinical events both cardiovascular and gastrointestinal are recommended
228,osteoarthritis oa is the most common form of arthritis
229,published guidelines and expert opinion are divided over the relative role of acetaminophen also called paracetamol or tylenol and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids as first line pharmacologic therapy
230,the comparative safety of acetaminophen and nsaids is also important to consider
231,this update to the original review includes nine additional rcts
232,to assess the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen versus placebo and versus nsaids ibuprofen diclofenac arthrotec celecoxib naproxen rofecoxib for treating oa
233,we searched medline up to july embase july cochrane central register of controlled trials central acp journal club dare cochrane database of systematic reviews all from to july
234,reference lists of identified rcts and pertinent review articles were also hand searched
235,published randomized controlled trials rcts evaluating the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen alone in oa were considered for inclusion
236,pain physical function and global assessment outcomes were reported
237,results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as standardized mean differences smd
238,dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk rr and the number needed to treat nnt was calculated
239,fifteen rcts involving participants were included in this review
240,seven rcts compared acetaminophen to placebo and ten rcts compared acetaminophen to nsaids
241,in the placebo controlled rcts acetaminophen was superior to placebo in five of the seven rcts and had a similar safety profile
242,compared to placebo a pooled analysis of five trials of overall pain using multiple methods demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in pain smd ci to which is of questionable clinical significance
243,the relative percent improvement from baseline was with an absolute change of points on a to scale
244,the nnt to achieve an improvement in pain ranged from to in the comparator controlled rcts acetaminophen was less effective overall than nsaids in terms of pain reduction global assessments and in terms of improvements in functional status
245,no significant difference was found overall between the safety of acetaminophen and nsaids although patients taking traditional nsaids were more likely to experience an adverse gi event rr ci to
246,of patients in the traditional nsaid group versus in the acetaminophen group experienced an adverse gi event
247,however the median trial duration was only weeks and it is difficult to assess adverse outcomes in a relatively short time period
248,the evidence to date suggests that nsaids are superior to acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with oa
249,the size of the treatment effect was modest and the median trial duration was only six weeks therefore additional considerations need to be factored in when making the decision between using acetaminophen or nsaids
250,in oa subjects with moderate to severe levels of pain nsaids appear to be more effective than acetaminophen
251,misoprostol can be used in the prevention of gastric ulcer in treatment with diclofenac and is used in rheumatic diseases
252,since misoprostol causes contractions of the uterus it can also be used to induce abortions when administrated vaginally
253,the aim of the study was to investigate if early pregnancy exposure to oral diclofenac misoprostol was associated with miscarriage
254,we conducted a nationwide cohort study identifying all registered pregnancies in denmark from to all births were identified using the medical birth registry and all records of induced abortion and miscarriage were from the national hospital register
255,data on drug use were from the national prescription register
256,cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the hazard of miscarriage in women exposed to diclofenac misoprostol in early pregnancy
257,we identified pregnancies births miscarriages induced abortions
258,one hundred sixty six were exposed to diclofenac misoprostol in the early pregnancy of which ended up in a miscarriage compared to among unexposed
259,the adjusted hazard ratio of having a miscarriage after exposure to diclofenac misoprostol in the first trimester was ci
260,we found an increased risk of miscarriage after exposure to diclofenac misoprostol during the early pregnancy
261,women in the fertile age should not be treated with the combination of diclofenac misoprostol if other options were available
262,to review the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cyclooxygenase cox selective non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids etodolac meloxicam celecoxib rofecoxib etoricoxib valdecoxib and lumiracoxib for osteoarthritis oa and rheumatoid arthritis ra
263,electronic databases were searched up to november industry submissions to the national institute for health and clinical excellence nice in were also reviewed
264,systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials rcts and a model based economic evaluation were undertaken
265,meta analyses were undertaken for each cox selective nsaid compared with placebo and non selective nsaids
266,the model was designed to run in two forms the full assessment group model agm which includes an initial drug switching cycle and the simpler agm where there is no initial cycle and no opportunity for the patient to switch nsaid
267,compared with non selective nsaids the cox selective nsaids were found to be equally as efficacious as the non selective nsaids although meloxicam was found to be of inferior or equivalent efficacy and also to be associated with significantly fewer clinical upper gastrointestinal ugi events although relatively small numbers of clinical gastrointestinal gi and myocardial infarction mi events were reported across trials
268,subgroup analyses of clinical and complicated ugi events and mi events in relation to aspirin use steroid use prior gi history and helicobacter pylori status were based on relatively small numbers and were inconclusive
269,in the rcts that included direct cox comparisons the drugs were equally tolerated and of equal efficacy
270,trials were of insufficient size and duration to allow comparison of risk of clinical ugi events complicated ugi events and mis
271,one rct compared cox celecoxib with a non selective nsaid combined with a gastroprotective agent diclofenac combined with omeprazole this included arthritis patients who had recently suffered a gi haemorrhage
272,although no significant difference in clinical gi events was reported the number of events was small and more such studies where patients genuinely need nsaids are required to confirm these data
273,a second trial showed that rofecoxib was associated with fewer diarrhoea events than a combination of diclofenac and misoprostol arthrotec
274,previously published cost effectiveness analyses indicated a wide of range of possible incremental cost per quality adjusted life year qaly gained estimates
275,using the simpler agm with ibuprofen or diclofenac alone as the comparator all of the cox products are associated with higher costs i e
276,positive incremental costs and small increases in effectiveness i e
277,positive incremental effectiveness measured in terms of qalys
278,the magnitude of the incremental costs and the incremental effects and therefore the incremental cost effectiveness ratios vary considerably across all cox selective nsaids
279,the base case incremental cost per qaly results for cox selective nsaids compared with diclofenac for the simpler model are celecoxib low dose pounds celecoxib high dose pounds etodolac branded pounds etodolac generic pounds etoricoxib pounds lumiracoxib pounds meloxicam low dose pounds meloxicam high dose pounds rofecoxib pounds and valdecoxib pounds
280,when the simpler agm was run using ibuprofen or diclofenac combined with proton pump inhibitor ppi as the comparator the results change substantially with the cox selective nsaids looking generally unattractive from a cost effectiveness point of view cox selective nsaids were dominated by ibuprofen or diclofenac combined with ppi in most cases
281,this applies both to standard and high risk arthritis patients defined in terms of previous gi ulcers
282,the full agm produced results broadly in line with the simpler model
283,the cox selective nsaids examined were found to be similar to non selective nsaids for the symptomatic relief of ra and oa and to provide superior gi tolerability the majority of evidence is in patients with oa
284,although cox selective nsaids offer protection against serious gi events the amount of evidence for this protective effect varied considerably across individual drugs
285,the volume of trial evidence with regard to cardiovascular safety also varied substantially between cox selective nsaids
286,increased risk of mi compared to non selective nsaids was observed among those drugs with greater volume of evidence in terms of exposure in patient years
287,economic modelling shows a wide range of possible costs per qaly gained in patients with oa and ra
288,costs per qaly also varied if individual drugs were used in standard or high risk patients the choice of non selective nsaid comparator and whether that nsaid was combined with a ppi
289,with reduced costs of ppis future primary research needs to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cox selective nsaids relative to non selective nsaids with a ppi
290,direct comparisons of different cox selective nsaids using equivalent doses that compare gi and mi risk are needed
291,pragmatic studies that include a wider range of people including the older age groups with a greater burden of arthritis are also necessary to inform clinical practice
292,editor s note the anti inflammatory drug rofecoxib vioxx was withdrawn from the market at the end of september after it was shown that long term use greater than months could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke
293,further information is available at www vioxx com
294,osteoarthritis is a chronic disease of the joints characterised by joint pain stiffness and loss of physical function
295,its onset is age related and occurs usually between the ages of and it is the commonest cause of disability in those aged over with oa of the knee and or hip affecting over per cent of the elderly population
296,to establish the efficacy and safety of rofecoxib in the management of oa by systematic review of available evidence
297,we searched the following databases up to august medline embase cochrane database of systematic reviews cochrane controlled trials register national research register nhs economic evaluation database health technology assessment database
298,the bibliographies of retrieved papers and content experts were consulted for additional references
299,all eligible randomised controlled trials rcts were included
300,no unpublished rcts were included in this edition of the review
301,data were abstracted independently by two reviewers
302,a validated checklist was used to score the quality of the rcts
303,comparable trials were pooled using fixed effects model
304,twenty six rcts were included
305,the comparators were placebo diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen nimesulide nabumetone paracetamol celecoxib and arthrotec
306,the evidence reviewed indicated that rofecoxib was more effective than placebo patient global response rr ci but was associated with more adverse events rr ci
307,there were no consistent differences in efficacy between rofecoxib and any of the active comparators at equivalent doses
308,endoscopic studies indicated that compared to ibuprofen mg three times a day rofecoxib caused fewer erosions and gastric ulcers at doses of mg and mg the difference in duodenal ulcers was evident only at a dose of mg
309,rofecoxib mg also caused more endoscopically observed ulcers greater than rofecoxib mg rr ci
310,very few of the trials reported overall rates of gi adverse events although rofecoxib was found to cause fewer gi events than naproxen
311,only one of the nine trials comparing rofecoxib to celecoxib reported on the overall rates of gi events and this was a comparison of the higher recommended dose of rofecoxib with the lower recommended dose of celecoxib
312,similarly the three trials in older hypertensive patients that examined the cardiovascular safety of rofecoxib and celecoxib used non comparable doses the results of these studies indicated that rofecoxib caused more patients to have oedema and a clinically significant increase in systolic blood pressure
313,this difference between rofecoxib and celecoxib was not evident in studies conducted in more general populations
314,rofecoxib was voluntarily withdrawn from global markets in october therefore there are no implications for practice concerning its use
315,there remains a number of questions over both the benefits and risks associated with cox ii selective agents and further work is ongoing
316,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are commonly used to manage arthritis
317,while controlling symptoms and improving quality of life nsaid use is associated with gastroduodenal injury and a annual risk for symptomatic gastroduodenal ulceration hemorrhage and perforation
318,this requires clinicians to balance the efficacy of nsaids against the potential risk of serious gastrointestinal events
319,identification and stratification of risk can help guide the optimal approach for arthritis management of individual patients or large populations such as managed care organizations
320,nsaid induced gastroenteropathy carries considerable economic consequences of arthritis costs are related to managing serious adverse events
321,it is reasonable to assume that these costs may not be incurred if high risk patients are recognized and optimally managed
322,newer therapies with proven safety margins present an attractive option especially for patients at higher risk
323,the single tablet formulations of diclofenac and misoprostol arthrotec offer an alternative in managing nsaid patients because of their inherent safety profile
324,studies with diclofenac misoprostol indicate its effectiveness in treating signs and symptoms of arthritis and in reducing the incidence of nsaid induced gastroenteropathy
325,as such this agent may provide improved medical and economic outcomes
326,this review discusses the clinical aspects of nsaid induced gastroenteropathy including available preventive therapies
327,approaches to assessing patients risk for developing complications and the relationship of medical risk and economic outcomes are also examined
328,although not all patients require preventive therapy patients with heightened risk may benefit clinically and economically from gastroprotective nsaids
329,additional research or modeling may provide further insight into the economic implications of managing and preventing nsaid induced gastroenteropathy
330,misoprostol a prostaglandin e analog is currently available to manage ulcer disease being used predominantly in the prophylaxis of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid induced ulceration a serious side effect of anti inflammatory therapy in arthritis
331,the protective effects of misoprostol have now also been shown to extend to cartilage in a series of experiment using an ex vivo system employing normal human and osteoarthritis oa cartilage
332,misoprostol reproducibly reverses inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis induced by interleukin and certain nsaids and also stimulates synthesis in oa cartilage
333,the article reviews these findings and also presents the results obtained in a study of oa cartilages in which synergy was demonstrated between misoprostol at ng ml and diclofenac mgr g ml in preventing proteoglycan synthesis
334,diclofenac on its own is unusual amongst nsaids in exerting virtually no deleterious effect on cartilage
335,the synergy with misoprostol is of clinical interest in view of the recent introduction of a misoprostol diclofenac combination product arthrotec the intention of which was to provide antiinflammatory efficacy with a reduced incidence of gi damage
336,the implications of these cartilage experiments is that such a combination may also offer improvements in the management of the arthritic process in oa and methods whereby this would be assessed clinically are discussed
337,the new class of antiinflammatory and analgesic drugs the selective cyclooxygenase cox inhibitors which promise to be devoid of the types of toxicity associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid especially adverse gastrointestinal effects are under clinical trial but are not yet available for use
338,all nsaid including those most recently introduced exhibit nonselectivity of action producing therapeutic blood levels that inhibit constitutive cox and deplete tissue protective prostaglandins
339,among nsaid the diclofenac misoprostol combination arthrotec is unique in possessing an active component misoprostol to help prevent nsaid induced gastrointestinal damage
340,ulcer damage and associated serious complications probably represent only the tip of the iceberg in relation to clinically significant side effects associated with the use of nsaid
341,in this context metaanalysis of large multicenter studies reported here has shown that patients taking nsaid show a mean decrease in hemoglobin over weeks assessment with some of patients exhibiting clinically significant decreases or g dl early in treatment
342,patients taking diclofenac misoprostol showed significantly less of a decline in hemoglobin and up to fewer clinically significant decreases than patients receiving diclofenac alone
343,the misoprostol component of diclofenac misoprostol may also help to restore homeostasis in tissues other than the gut
344,inhibition of the activity or release of various tissue damaging agents and inflammatory cytokines e g thromboxane and interleukin are described as are in vivo animal studies that have revealed synergistic or potentiating analgesic and antiinflammatory activities between misoprostol and nsaid particularly diclofenac
345,clinical studies in postsurgical dental pain in more than patients have now shown enhanced analgesia with greater relief over a longer period for the diclofenac misoprostol combination compared with diclofenac alone
346,the relevance of these findings to pain and inflammation control in arthritis is discussed
347,enhanced control of morning stiffness provided by diclofenac misoprostol possibly also the result of misoprostol diclofenac synergy is also reported and the development of an objective system that measures hour ambulatory activity is described
348,using this numact recorder improved mobility in patients receiving diclofenac mg misoprostol microg was observed compared with patients treated with diclofenac mg slow release
349,further studies are being performed employing magnetic resonance imaging both to assess antiinflammatory effects in joint soft tissue architecture and to assess whether the synergistic stimulatory effects of diclofenac and misoprostol on human osteoarthritic cartilage that have been reported in vitro are clinically evident
350,a growing body of evidence supports the view that the diclofenac misoprostol combination provides an improved therapeutic ratio over diclofenac alone not only by improving gastrointestinal safety but also by enhancing analgesic antiinflammatory effects
351,the fixed combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol arthrotec is the only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid that contains a gastroprotective component and is available in formulations an enteric coated core of diclofenac sodium mg surrounded by a mantle of misoprostol microg and a mg enteric coated diclofenac core also surrounded by a microg mantle of misoprostol
352,this article reviews the european clinical experience with both formulations in patients with arthritis
353,three randomized blinded multicenter studies including one in general practice evaluated the efficacy of combination diclofenac misoprostol versus diclofenac or ibuprofen in a total of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra or osteoarthritis oa
354,four additional studies assessed antiarthritic efficacy and employed endoscopy to compare the gastroduodenal safety of combined diclofenac misoprostol with that of diclofenac naproxen piroxicam or indomethacin in patients with ra oa or ankylosing spondylitis
355,the gastroduodenal safety and antiarthritic efficacy of diclofenac misoprostol was compared with that of diclofenac in one endoscopy study involving patients with ra or oa
356,the efficacy and safety data obtained from these european clinical trials show that both formulations diclofenac misoprostol and diclofenac misoprostol are effective antiinflammatory drugs with clinical efficacy equivalent to that of diclofenac
357,diclofenac misoprostol is at least as effective as naproxen piroxicam indomethacin and ibuprofen
358,both formulations of the combination were associated with significantly fewer gastroduodenal ulcers compared with diclofenac
359,in separate studies the tolerability of diclofenac misoprostol as determined by withdrawal rates was shown to be equivalent to that of diclofenac naproxen piroxicam and ibuprofen and the tolerability of diclofenac misoprostol was shown to be equivalent to that of diclofenac
360,the diclofenac misoprostol was associated with fewer decreases in hemoglobin concentration compared with diclofenac in the general practice study as well as in hospital patients
361,diclofenac misoprostol and diclofenac misoprostol are effective in treating the signs and symptoms of ra and oa and are well tolerated by the majority of patients
362,both of these formulations achieve a significant reduction in the incidence of both gastric and duodenal ulcers compared with other nsaid
363,to determine whether or not n of trials with diclofenac misoprostol arthrotec are superior and cost effective compared with standard treatment in osteoarthritis oa
364,we randomized subjects with oa who were uncertain that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid were helpful to different groups
365,one group received conventional treatment whereby they were told to stop their nsaid and to wait and see what happened
366,if necessary treatment with other nsaid and all other usual oa treatment strategies were used
367,the other group received a series of crossover trials with diclofenac mg and misoprostol micro g twice a day or an identical placebo for weeks each in a random double blinded manner
368,every weeks they chose which treatment they preferred
369,by months if there was no clear preference the n of trials were discontinued
370,all trial participants were seen monthly for months and at months
371,all costs direct and indirect were collected for both groups
372,costs of research generated visits were not counted in the conventional treatment group
373,fifty one subjects were randomized stratified by most symptomatic oa area with knee with hip and with hand oa
374,twenty four were randomized into the n of group
375,there were no differences in the baseline and followup variables including age income education past and current nsaid use global assessment health assessment questionnaire haq western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index womac and medical outcome study short form sf scores
376,in the n of group patients preferred diclofenac in total of whom did only one round did rounds and did rounds
377,none of the n of patients preferred placebo and had no preference dropped out at baseline
378,at months of in conventional therapy and of in n of were taking nsaid
379,that is nsaid appeared to be effective in of n of subjects and of conventionally treated patients even though subjects were initially uncertain that their nsaid were helpful
380,the total oa related costs in canadian dollars per patient in for n of treated patients at months were dollars dollars sd versus dollars dollars for controls excluding research visits for controls p
381,the haq pain and disability womac scales and physician global assessments improved more in the n of group at greater cost but no between group differences in efficacy were seen possibly due to small numbers
382,n of trials were time consuming in these patients and are more expensive but with slightly better outcomes
383,in addition nsaid seem to be effective in a majority of subjects with oa who have been uncertain of their benefit
384,to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer assisted educational intervention to facilitate appropriate utilization of an antiinflammatory medication arthrotec and investigate the mechanism by which it produces these effects
385,a double blind multicenter randomized controlled trial studied patients over age years with hip or knee osteoarthritis oa
386,all patients n were treated with the medication diclofenac misoprostol
387,patients randomized to the experimental group interacted with a computer program delivering information about their disease the medication its intended and side effects appropriate utilization distinguishing between appropriate versus inappropriate continuation and discontinuation of medication patient involvement in treatment related decision making and communication with service providers
388,in the control condition another computer program presented generic information about oa
389,data were collected at pre test post test and week followup
390,appropriate utilization of the medication occurred more frequently in the experimental than the control group p
391,compared to controls the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge realistic expectations of drug benefits perceived ease of adherence and self efficacy all p
392,there was no difference between the groups with regard to illness intrusiveness pain or disability but there was a greater improvement in stiffness in the experimental group ci to compared to the control group ci to at a level of p
393,in conditions such as oa where patient involvement in decision making is essential to the effectiveness of care computer assisted education focussing on appropriate vs inappropriate continuation and discontinuation of medications has the potential to improve knowledge increase self efficacy maintain realistic expectations and facilitate adherence resulting in more beneficial clinical outcomes
394,secondary growth by successive cambia is a rare phenomenon in woody plant species
395,only few plant species within different phylogenetic clades have secondary growth by more than one vascular cambium
396,often these successive cambia are organised concentrically
397,in the mangrove genus avicennia however the successive cambia seem to have a more complex organisation
398,this study aimed i at understanding the development of successive cambia by giving a three dimensional description of the hydraulic architecture of avicennia and ii at unveiling the possible adaptive nature of growth by successive cambia through a study of the ecological distribution of plant species with concentric internal phloem
399,avicennia had a complex network of non cylindrical wood patches the complexity of which increased with more stressful ecological conditions
400,as internal phloem has been suggested to play a role in water storage and embolism repair the spatial organisation of avicennia wood could provide advantages in the ecologically stressful conditions species of this mangrove genus are growing in
401,furthermore we could observe that of the woody shrub and tree species with concentric internal phloem occurred in either dry or saline environments strengthening the hypothesis that successive cambia provide the necessary advantages for survival in harsh environmental conditions
402,successive cambia are an ecologically important characteristic which seems strongly related with water limited environments
403,the seedling stage is one of the most critical phases in the life history of plants during this stage plants must develop efficient conductive and storage systems before the end of the favorable season
404,little is known about the origin of successive cambia in seedlings of tree species of ipomoea or about how many cambia are produced in one growth season
405,we studied the anatomy of ipomoea arborescens seedlings to defi ne when cambium is differentiated to determine how many cambia differentiate in one year of growth and to relate the development of successive cambia to physiological aspects of growth
406,seedlings from to d of age were harvested and their morphology as well as co and water exchange were evaluated at and d after germination
407,six stages of development were established to study origin of cambia
408,cambium was differentiated d after germination at a time when seedlings had photosynthetic cotyledons with high specific area assimilation rate and stomatal conductance
409,differentiation of the fi rst successive cambium occurred inparenchyma cells below the endodermis or starch sheath
410,development of reverse cambium and intraxylary phloem cambiumdemonstrated that ontogenetic shifts may occur in different stem regions
411,in the mo old plants all cambia reactivated and earlywood wide vessels were differentiated
412,the origin of successive cambia the occurrence of more than one type of cambium and parenchyma proliferation are features shared by i arborescens with its climbing ancestors as a strategy for survival in the harsh environment of tropical deciduous forests
413,secondary growth from vascular cambia results in radial woody growth of stems
414,the innovation of secondary vascular development during plant evolution allowed the production of novel plant forms ranging from massive forest trees to flexible woody lianas
415,we present examples of the extensive phylogenetic variation in secondary vascular growth and discuss current knowledge of genes that regulate the development of vascular cambia and woody tissues
416,from these foundations we propose strategies for genomics based research in the evolution of development which is a next logical step in the study of secondary growth
417,successive vascular cambia are involved in the secondary growth of at least woody species from plant families
418,in the mangrove avicennia these successive cambia are organized in patches creating stems with non concentric xylem tissue surrounded by internal phloem tissue
419,little is known about radial growth and tree stem dynamics in trees with this type of anatomy
420,this study aims to clarify the process of secondary growth of avicennia trees by studying its patchiness and study the radial increment of avicennia stems both temporary and permanent in relation to local climatic and environmental conditions
421,a test is made of the hypothesis that patchy radial growth and stem dynamics enable avicennia trees to better survive conditions of extreme physiological drought
422,methods stem variations were monitored by automatic point dendrometers at four different positions around and along the stem of two avicennia marina trees in the mangrove forest of gazi bay kenya during year
423,patchiness was found in the radial growth and shrinkage and swelling patterns of avicennia stems
424,it was however potentially rather than systematically present i e
425,stems reacted either concentrically or patchily to environment triggers and it was fresh water availability and not tidal inundation that affected radial increment
426,it is concluded that the ability to develop successive cambia in a patchy way enables avicennia trees to adapt to changes in the prevailing environmental conditions enhancing its survival in the highly dynamic mangrove environment
427,limited water could be used in a more directive way investing all the attainable resources in only some locations of the tree stem so that at least at these locations there is enough water to for example overcome vessel embolisms or create new cells
428,as these locations change with time the overall functioning of the tree can be maintained
430,bark thickness is ecologically crucial affecting functions from fire protection to photosynthesis
431,bark thickness scales predictably with stem diameter but there is little consensus on whether this scaling is a passive consequence of growth or an important adaptive phenomenon requiring explanation
432,with a comparative study across species we test the expectation that if bark thickness stem diameter scaling is adaptive it should be possible to find ecological situations in which scaling is predictably altered in this case between species with different types and deployments of phloem
433,dicots with successive cambia and monocots which have phloem free bark had predictably thinner inner mostly living bark than plants with single cambia
434,lianas which supply large leaf areas with limited stem area had much thicker inner bark than self supporting plants
435,gymnosperms had thicker outer bark than angiosperms
436,inner bark probably scales with plant metabolic demands for example with leaf area
437,outer bark scales with stem diameter less predictably probably reflecting diverse adaptive factors for example it tends to be thicker in fire prone species and very thin when bark photosynthesis is favored
438,predictable bark thickness stem diameter scaling across plants with different photosynthate translocation demands and modes strongly supports the idea that this relationship is functionally important and adaptively significant
439,studies have shown that diabetes and cardiovascular disease can be controlled and prevented through the modification of behavioral risk factors
440,the transtheoretical model of behavior change also known as the stages of change model offers promise for designing behavior change interventions
441,however this model has rarely been applied in group settings with minority communities
442,to address racial and ethnic disparities related to the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease the new hampshire reach initiative has designed and implemented change for life cambia tu vida a health promotion program based on the stages of change model for african descendent and latino residents of southern new hampshire
443,the program guides participants through the five stages of change and provides resources to support healthy behavior change
444,we also sponsor periodic class reunions that help program graduates to maintain these healthy habits
445,this article describes curriculum development participant feedback and early pretest and posttest evaluation results from a standardized assessment
446,as palliative care grows and evolves robust programs to train and develop the next generation of leaders are needed
447,continued integration of palliative care into the fabric of usual health care requires leaders who are prepared to develop novel programs think creatively about integration into the current health care environment and focus on sustainability of efforts
448,such leadership development initiatives must prepare leaders in clinical research and education realms to ensure that palliative care matures and evolves in diverse ways
449,the cambia health foundation designed the sojourns scholar leadership program to facilitate leadership development among budding palliative care leaders
450,the background aims and results to date of each of the projects from the scholars of the inaugural cohort are presented
451,there is a pressing workforce shortage and leadership scarcity in palliative care to adequately meet the demands of individuals with serious illness and their families
452,to address this gap the cambia health foundation launched its sojourns scholars leadership program in an initiative designed to identify cultivate and advance the next generation of palliative care leaders
453,this report intends to summarize the second cohort of sojourns scholars projects and their reflection on their leadership needs
454,this report summarizes the second cohort of sojourns scholars project and their reflection on leadership needs
455,after providing a written reflection on their own projects the second cohort participated in a group interview fireside chat to elicit their perspectives on barriers and facilitators in providing palliative care issues facing leadership in palliative care in the united states and lessons from personal and professional growth as leaders in palliative care
456,they analyzed the transcript of the group interview using qualitative content analysis methodology
457,three themes emerged from descriptions of the scholars project experience challenges in palliative care practice leadership strategies in palliative care and three lessons learned to be a leader were identified
458,challenges included perceptions of palliative care payment and policy and workforce development
459,educating and collaborating with other clinicians and influencing policy change are important strategies used to advance palliative care
460,time management leading team effort and inspiring others are important skills that promote effectiveness as a leader
461,emerging leaders have a unique view of conceptualizing contemporary palliative care and shaping the future
462,providing comprehensive coordinated care that is high quality patient and family centered and readily available depends on strong leadership in palliative care
463,the cambia scholars program represents a unique opportunity
464,while monocots lack the ability to produce a vascular cambium or woody growth some monocot lineages evolved a novel lateral meristem the monocot cambium which supports secondary radial growth of stems
465,in contrast to the vascular cambium found in woody angiosperm and gymnosperm species the monocot cambium produces secondary vascular bundles which have an amphivasal organization of tracheids encircling a central strand of phloem
466,currently there is no information concerning the molecular genetic basis of the development or evolution of the monocot cambium
467,here we report high quality transcriptomes for monocot cambium and early derivative tissues in two monocot genera yucca and cordyline
468,monocot cambium transcript profiles were compared to those of vascular cambia and secondary xylem tissues of two forest tree species populus trichocarpa and eucalyptus grandis
469,monocot cambium transcript levels showed that there are extensive overlaps between the regulation of monocot cambia and vascular cambia
470,candidate regulatory genes that vary between the monocot and vascular cambia were also identified and included members of the kanadi and cle families involved in polarity and cell cell signaling respectively
471,we suggest that the monocot cambium may have evolved in part through reactivation of genetic mechanisms involved in vascular cambium regulation
472,to account for the positions in which vascular cambia regenerate in wound callus a gradient induction hypothesis was proposed in in terms of gradients in some factor as yet unknown
473,it now seems likely that the gradient is based on morphogen diffusion between source and sink on opposite sides of existing cambia with morphogen diffusing into the adjoining wound callus
474,it is specifically proposed that there are two morphogens auxin diffusing centrifugally and sucrose diffusing centripetally
475,the cambium then regenerates along a path where the ratio of auxin to sucrose concentration is similar to that at the original cambium and its orientation as regards xylem and phloem formation is determined by the direction of the gradient in this ratio
476,these proposals are supported by published evidence on auxin and sucrose concentration gradients across the cambium and on their sources movements and known effects on vascular differentiation
477,simulations of the proposed positional control system predict patterns of cambial regeneration and orientation corresponding to those observed in four different types of wound and graft
478,unlike animals plants often have an indefinite genetic potency to form new organs throughout their entire lifespan
479,growth and organogenesis are driven by cell divisions in meristems at distinct sites within the plant
480,since the meristems contributing to axial thickening in dicots cambia are separated from places where axes elongate apical meristems there is a need of communication to coordinate growth
481,in their behavior some meristematic cells resemble animal stem cells whose daughter cells either maintain the capacity to divide over a long period of time or undergo differentiation
482,the behavior of stem cells is regulated by their microenvironment the so called niche
483,the stem and niche cell concept is now also widely accepted for apical meristems
484,an integral part of the cambial niche has recently been localized to the phloem
485,it steers cell division activity in the cambium via the release of a peptide signal and may be a hub to integrate signals from other stem cell populations to coordinate growth
486,although these signals have yet to be determined the discovery of the cambial niche cells will pave the way for a better understanding of inter meristematic communication and cambial stem cell behavior
487,the secondary laticifer in rubber tree hevea brasiliensis muell
489,is a specific tissue within the secondary phloem
490,this tissue differentiates from the vascular cambia and its function is natural rubber biosynthesis and storage
491,given that jasmonates play a pivotal role in secondary laticifer differentiation we established an experimental system with jasmonate ja mimic coronatine cor for studying the secondary laticifer differentiation in this system differentiation occurs within five days of the treatment of epicormic shoots with cor
492,in the present study the experimental system was used to perform transcriptome sequencing and gene expression analysis
493,a total of unigenes were assembled and unigenes were mapped at least in one public database
494,of these being annotated unigenes unigenes were differentially expressed early after cor treatment and unigenes were differentially expressed late after cor treatment
495,at the early stage unigenes were up regulated while unigenes were down regulated
496,at the late stage the numbers of up and down regulated unigenes were and respectively
497,the annotation data and gene expression analysis of the differentially expressed unigenes suggest that ja mediated signalling ca
498,secondary growth via successive cambia has been intriguing researchers for decades
499,insight into the mechanism of growth layer formation is however limited to the cellular level
500,the present study aims to clarify secondary growth via successive cambia in the mangrove species avicennia marina on a macroscopic level addressing the formation of the growth layer network as a whole
501,in addition previously suggested effects of salinity on growth layer formation were reconsidered
502,a year cambial marking experiment was performed on trees from eight sites in two mangrove forests in kenya
503,environmental soil water salinity and nutrients soil texture inundation frequency and tree characteristics diameter height leaf area index were recorded for each site
504,both groups of variables were analysed in relation to annual number of growth layers annual radial increment and average growth layer width of stem discs
505,between trees of the same site the number of growth layers formed during the year study period varied from only part of a growth layer up to four growth layers and was highly correlated to the corresponding radial increment mm year even along the different sides of asymmetric stem discs
506,the radial increment was unrelated to salinity but the growth layer width decreased with increasing salinity and decreasing tree height
507,a patchy growth mechanism was proposed with an optimal growth at distinct moments in time at different positions around the stem circumference
508,this strategy creates the opportunity to form several growth layers simultaneously as observed in of the studied trees which may optimize tree growth under favourable conditions
509,strong evidence was provided for a mainly endogenous trigger controlling cambium differentiation with an additional influence of current environmental conditions in a trade off between hydraulic efficiency and mechanical stability
510,migraine headache affects about of western populations and is the third most common disease worldwide sixth in terms of disability
511,in triptans were introduced in the united states as a new treatment for managing migraine attacks but their use is limited by lack of response and safety concerns in some patients
512,treatment options for patients with migraine who fail or cannot tolerate triptans include switching to another medication or adding an adjunctive medication
513,desirable characteristics reported by patients for acute treatment of migraine attacks include complete pain relief fast onset of action and no pain recurrence
514,diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medication that has been established as effective for acute treatment of migraine by the american headache society based on available evidence
515,diclofenac potassium for oral solution is rapidly absorbed achieving maximal plasma concentrations in min which coincides with a rapid onset of effect
516,in a comparison of diclofenac potassium for oral solution with diclofenac potassium tablets the solution achieved a significant reduction in headache intensity beginning at min compared with min for the tablet
517,across randomized clinical trials approximately of patients were pain free h after administration of diclofenac oral solution and the effects were maintained over a h period
518,diclofenac potassium for oral solution is well tolerated the most common adverse events are dizziness and gastrointestinal complaints with incidences similar to placebo
519,no serious adverse events have been reported in clinical trials of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in the acute treatment of migraine
520,diclofenac oral solution may offer rapid and sustained pain relief for patients who do not achieve pain resolution with other medications
521,in addition patients who experience central sensitization with allodynia may benefit from the cyclooxygenase blocking activity of diclofenac which is needed in this advanced phase of migraine

526,resveratrol taxol podophyllotoxin withanolides and their derivatives find applications in anti cancer therapy
527,they are plant derived compounds whose chemical structures and synthesis limit their natural availability and restrict a large scale industrial production
528,hence their production by various biotechnological approaches may hold promise for a continuous and reliable mode of supply
529,we review process and product patents in this regard
530,accordingly we provide a general outline to search the freely accessible wipo epo uspto and cambia databases with several keywords and patent codes
531,we have tabulated both granted and filed patents from the said databases
532,we retrieved patents from these databases
533,novel biotechnological processes for production of these anticancer compounds include agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated hairy root culture suspension culture cell culture with elicitors use of recombinant microorganisms and bioreactors among others
534,the results are indicative of being both database specific as well as queryspecific
535,a ten year search window yielded patents

538,wood production is dependent on the activity of the vascular cambium which develops from the fascicular and interfascicular cambia
539,however little is known about the mechanisms controlling how the vascular cambium is developed in woody species
540,here we show that ptrhb belonging to the populus hd zip iii family plays a critical role in the process of vascular cambium development
541,ptrhb was specifically expressed in shoot tip and stem vascular tissue at an early developmental stage
542,repression of ptrhb caused defects in the development of the secondary vascular system due to failures in interfascicular cambium formation
543,by contrast overexpression of ptrhb induced cambium activity and xylem differentiation during secondary vascular development
544,transcriptional analysis of ptrhb repressed plants indicated that auxin response and cell proliferation were affected in the formation of the interfascicular cambium
545,taken together these results suggest that ptrhb is required for interfascicular cambium formation to develop the vascular cambium in woody species
546,agrobacterium mediated transformation is a suitable method to transform different cultivars using different systems of a tumefaciens strains and binary vectors as well as selection cassettes
547,we describe here a detailed protocol for two cultivars one naked and one husked using the agl strain and the pgreen vector containing the nptii selection cassette http www pgreen ac uk suitable for oat as well as other cereals
548,the pgreen vector system was recently developed for pbract http www bract org and its transformation ability for cereals was proved
549,assuming our experience and the latest knowledge on agrobacterium mediated transformation of cereals we suggest using in the protocol one of the newly developed pbract or pcambia http www cambia org daisy cambia vector systems which carry different selection cassettes
550,the commonly used selection genes nptii bar and hpt were proved to be applicable for oat transformation and might be used as needed
551,diclofenac potassium powder for oral solution voltfast catafast cambia hereafter referred to as diclofenac potassium powder is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine
552,this article reviews the pharmacological properties of diclofenac potassium powder and its efficacy and tolerability in patients with acute migraine
553,diclofenac potassium powder was clinically efficacious and generally well tolerated in placebo controlled trials in patients with this indication it was more effective than diclofenac potassium tablets with regard to the primary endpoint of h pain relief as well as in several important secondary endpoints such as time to onset of analgesic action
554,the oral powder for solution formulation of diclofenac potassium is a useful option in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura
555,physical laws and processes have profoundly influenced plant evolution
556,their effects are invariably size dependent and thus subject to scaling as well as biophysical analyses even though these effects differ depending upon the fluid water or air in which plants evolve
557,although organisms cannot obviate the effects of physical laws and processes the consequences of these effects can be altered by ontogenetic or phylogenetic alterations in geometry shape or orientation as well as in body size
558,these assertions are examined using theoretical insights and empirical data drawn from extant and fossil plants pertinent to four evolutionary transitions the evolution of multicellularity the transition from an aquatic to an aerial habitat the evolution of vascular tissues and the evolution of secondary growth by the independent acquisition of cambia
559,this examination shows how physical laws limit phenotypic expression but how they also simultaneously provide alternative potentially adaptive possibilities
560,there are many categories and individual types of headache and most have a variety of treatment protocols while a few are best treated by just one medication
561,this paper will concentrate on acute care medications for migraine and discuss some new and future acute care treatments
562,there is not much to discuss about prevention except that onabotulinumtoxina has been approved for prevention of chronic migraine
563,cluster headache will also be discussed as there are some future treatments for acute care and prevention being studied at present
564,for the acute care of migraine in the us we have seven triptans by tablet plus other routes and one non steroidal anti inflammatory medication approved by the fda that is currently available cambia brand of buffered diclofenac potassium for oral solution
565,there are several other acute care medications in various stages of development and there are three new methods of administering a triptan and others under investigation
566,the optimal acute care therapy for migraine should be faster easier to use and more efficient with fewer adverse events than what is currently available
567,what follows is a brief review of the status in development for five of the many new acute care medications being investigated the cgrp antagonist tablet telcagepant the sumatriptan iontophoretic patch zelrix sumatriptan powder for use in the optinose apparatus dihydroergotamine for oral inhalation levadex civamide nasal solution for prevention of episodic cluster headache civanex and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation for acute cluster attacks in chronic cluster headaches
568,other future treatments that will not be discussed include transcranial magnetic stimulation a ht f agonist named alniditan large conductance calcium activated potassium channel openers glial modulators or other medications and devices in early stages of development
569,slarfa is expressed in most plant organs including roots leaves flowers and fruits
570,a detailed expression study revealed that slarfa is mainly expressed in the leaf nodes and cross sections of the nodes indicated that slarfa expression is restricted to vascular organs
571,decapitation or the application of benzylaminopurine bap can initially promote axillary shoots during which slarfa expression is significantly reduced
572,down regulation of slarfa expression results in an increased frequency of dicotyledons and significantly increased lateral organ development
573,stem anatomy studies have revealed significantly altered cambia and phloem in tomato plants expressing down regulated levels of arfa which is associated with obvious alterations in auxin distribution
574,further analysis has revealed that altered auxin transport may occur via altered pin expression
575,to identify the interactions of aux iaa and tpl with arfa four axillary shoot development repressors that are down regulated during axillary shoot development iaa iaa sltpl and sltpl were tested for their direct interactions with arfa
576,although none of these repressors are directly involved in arfa activity similar expression patterns of iaa iaa and arfa implied they might work tightly in axillary shoot formation and other developmental processes
577,nepenthes attracts wide attention with its spectacularly shaped carnivorous pitchers cultural value and horticultural curiosity
578,despite the plant s iconic fascination surprisingly little anatomical detail is known about the genus beyond its modified leaf tip traps
579,here the wood anatomical diversity of nepenthes is explored
580,this diversity is further assessed with a phylogenetic framework to investigate whether the wood characters within the genus are relevant from an evolutionary or ecological perspective or rather depend on differences in developmental stages growth habits substrates or precipitation
581,observations were performed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
582,ancestral states of selected wood and pith characters were reconstructed using an existing molecular phylogeny for nepenthes and a broader caryophyllales framework
583,pairwise comparisons were assessed for possible relationships between wood anatomy and developmental stages growth habits substrates and ecology
584,wood anatomy of nepenthes is diffuse porous with mainly solitary vessels showing simple bordered perforation plates and alternate intervessel pits fibres with distinctly bordered pits occasionally septate apotracheal axial parenchyma and co occurring uni and multiseriate rays often including silica bodies
585,precipitation and growth habit stem length are linked with vessel density and multiseriate ray height while soil type correlates with vessel diameter vessel element length and maximum ray width
586,for caryophyllales as a whole silica grains successive cambia and bordered perforation plates are the result of convergent evolution
587,peculiar helical sculpturing patterns within various cell types occur uniquely within the insectivorous clade of non core caryophyllales
588,the wood anatomical variation in nepenthes displays variation for some characters dependent on soil type precipitation and stem length but is largely conservative
589,the helical banded fibre sclereids that mainly occur idioblastically in pith and cortex are synapomorphic for nepenthes while other typical nepenthes characters evolved convergently in different caryophyllales lineages

595,the secondary laticifer in the secondary phloem of rubber tree are a specific tissue differentiating from vascular cambia
596,the number of the secondary laticifers is closely related to the rubber productivity of hevea
597,factors involved in the mechanical wounding induced laticifer differentiation were analyzed by using paraffin section gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and northern blot techniques
598,dehydration of the wounded bark tissues triggered a burst of hydrogen peroxide abscisic acid and jasmonates and up regulated the expression of hbaosa which was associated with the secondary laticifer differentiation strictly limited to the wounded area
599,application of exogenous hydrogen peroxide methyl jasmonate and polyethylene glycol peg could induce the secondary laticifer differentiation respectively
600,moreover benzylaminopurine a synthetic cytokinin enhanced the methyl jasmonate induced secondary laticifer differentiation
601,however the dehydration induced secondary laticifer differentiation was inhibited by exogenous abscisic acid
602,diphenyleneiodonium chloride dpi a specific inhibitor of nadph oxidase was effective in inhibiting the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as well as of jasmonates upon dehydration
603,it blocked the dehydration induced but not the methyl jasmonate induced secondary laticifer differentiation
604,the results suggested a stress signal pathway mediating the wound induced secondary laticifer differentiation in rubber tree

618,to meet the demands of a larger and more affluent global population wheat yields must increase faster this century than last with less irrigation fertilizer and land
619,modelling and experiments consistently demonstrate a large potential for increasing wheat productivity by improving root systems however application of research to new varieties is slow because of the inherent difficulties associated with working underground
620,this review makes the case for the use of the model grass brachypodium distachyon to simplify root research and accelerate the identification of genes underlying wheat root improvement
621,brachypodium is a small temperate grass with many genomic genetic and experimental resources that make it a tractable model plant
622,brachypodium and wheat have very similar root anatomies which are distinct from rice root anatomy that is specialized to help it overcome anaerobic conditions associated with submerged roots
623,as a dicotyledonous plant arabidopsis has an even more divergent root system that features a tap root system and cambia with secondary growth both of which are lacking in the grasses
624,the major advantage of brachypodium is its small stature that allows the adult grass root system to be readily phenotyped unlike rice and maize
625,this will facilitate the identification of genes in adult roots that greatly influence yield by modulating water uptake during flowering and grain development
626,a summary of the advantages of brachypodium for root studies is presented including the adult root system architecture and root growth during grain development
627,routes to translate discoveries from brachypodium to wheat are also discussed
628,older adults years of age with acute myeloid leukaemia spend a substantial proportion of their life in hospital after diagnosis
629,we examined reasons for their hospital admissions and identified potentially avoidable hospital admissions pah in this age group in the usa
630,in this retrospective analysis we examined the reasons for hospital admissions in older patients diagnosed with and treated for acute myeloid leukaemia at two tertiary care hospitals in the usa
631,we included patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy or non intensive treatment
632,we excluded those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia those seen only for a one time consultation who received primary treatment elsewhere and those who received supportive care alone
633,we identified the eligible cohort using the dana farber cancer institute and massachusetts general hospital leukemia clinical research information systems database
634,practising oncologists used a consensus driven medical record review process to identify the primary reason for each hospital admission and categorise it as potentially avoidable or not avoidable on the basis of an adaptation of graham s criteria for pah
635,we used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of pah
636,between may and dec we assessed hospital admissions excluding initial admission for diagnosis in consecutively admitted patients
637,the most common primary reasons for hospital admissions were fever or infection planned admission for chemotherapy or transplantation and uncontrolled symptoms
638,we identified of unplanned hospital admissions as potentially avoidable among these admissions were readmissions because of previous premature hospital discharge because of problems that could have been managed in the outpatient setting and because of failure of timely outpatient follow up
639,in a mixed logistic regression model higher education odds ratio ci p and receipt of non intensive induction chemotherapy p were predictors of pah
640,although many hospital admissions in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia are unavoidable and driven by the illness course and its treatment a substantial proportion are potentially avoidable
641,future interventions to reduce pah in this population are clearly warranted

645,this article outlines recent experience and approaches to some of the logistical hurdles that must be overcome in pursuit of more transparent economic models
646,the institute for clinical and economic review icer has recently completed a pilot transparency initiative that made drafts of executable economic models available to involved drug manufacturers during the review process
647,by directly viewing and interacting with models structures inputs key assumptions and results stakeholders were better equipped to provide valuable feedback as part of the health technology assessments
648,this experience along with feedback received from the modeling collaborators and relevant manufacturers during this pilot have helped determine icer s approach to sharing economic models associated with ongoing and future evidence reviews

654,the secondary laticifer in the secondary phloem is differentiated from the vascular cambia of the rubber tree hevea brasiliensis muell
656,the number of secondary laticifers is closely related to the rubber yield potential of hevea
657,pharmacological data show that jasmonic acid and its precursor linolenic acid are effective in inducing secondary laticifer differentiation in epicormic shoots of the rubber tree
658,in the present study an experimental system of coronatine induced laticifer differentiation was developed to perform ssh identification of genes with differential expression
659,a total of positive clones were obtained by blue white screening of which clones came from the forward ssh library while clones came from the reverse ssh library
660,approximately of the clones and of the clones contained cdna inserts by colony pcr screening
661,a total of of the ests were detected to be differentially expressed by reverse northern blot and sequenced
662,approximately unigenes with an average length of bp from the forward and unigenes with an average length of bp from the reverse ssh libraries were assembled and annotated
663,the unigenes were associated with the stress defense response plant hormone signal transduction and structure development
664,it is suggested that ca signal transduction and redox seem to be involved in differentiation while pga and eif are associated with the division of cambium initials for cor induced secondary laticifer differentiation in the rubber tree
665,western red cedar thuja plicata heartwood contains abundant amounts of structurally complex plicatic acid derived lignans that help confer protective properties and longevity to this tissue type
666,although the lignan biochemical entry point is dirigent protein mediated the formation of heartwood and its associated lignans in some species remains poorly understood due to technical difficulties of working with the former
667,to begin to address such questions this study therefore focused on the anatomical localization of dirigent protein and s rrna control gene transcripts within recalcitrant woody tissues including heartwood
668,this in situ mrna hybridization approach enabled detection of dirigent protein transcripts in cork cambia vascular cambia and ray parenchyma cells of the sapwood but not the heartwood under the conditions employed
669,by contrast the hybridization of the s rrna control transcript resulted in its detection in all tissue types including radial parenchyma cells of apparently preformed heartwood
670,application of in situ hybridization to such recalcitrant tissues thus demonstrates the utility of this technique in identifying specific cell types involved in heartwood formation as well as the relationship of dirigent protein localization to that of heartwood metabolite generation
671,the secondary growth of a woody stem requires the formation of a vascular cambium at an appropriate position and proper patterning of the vascular tissues derived from the cambium
672,class iii homeodomain leucine zipper hd zip transcription factors have been implicated in polarity determination and patterning in lateral organs and primary vascular tissues and in the initiation and function of shoot apical meristems
673,we report here the functional characterization of a populus class iii hd zip gene poprevoluta pre that demonstrates another role for class iii hd zips in regulating the development of cambia and secondary vascular tissues
674,pre is orthologous to arabidopsis arabidopsis thaliana revoluta and is expressed in both the shoot apical meristem and in the cambial zone and secondary vascular tissues
675,transgenic populus expressing a microrna resistant form of pre presents unstable phenotypic abnormalities affecting both primary and secondary growth
676,surprisingly phenotypic changes include abnormal formation of cambia within cortical parenchyma that can produce secondary vascular tissues in reverse polarity
677,genes misexpressed in pre mutants include transcription factors and auxin related genes previously implicated in class iii hd zip functions during primary growth
678,together these results suggest that pre plays a fundamental role in the initiation of the cambium and in regulating the patterning of secondary vascular tissues
679,neither anatomical change nor physiological abnormalities have been observed in the cambia of older trees
680,however different sensitivity and period of significant responses to climate suggest the existence of some age related change in the patterns of cambial activity and or wood cell formation
681,here weekly cambial activity and timing and duration of xylem cell enlargement and wall thickening were compared in adult yr and old yr trees of larix decidua pinus cembra and picea abies at the alpine timberline during and timings and durations of xylogenesis differed between adult and old trees with wk shorter cambial activity found in the latter
682,the delayed onset of cambium division and lower cell production in old trees with respect to adult trees led to reductions of in the overall duration of xylem differentiation
683,these results demonstrate that cambial dynamics change during the tree lifespan and that the time window of tree ring production shortens with age
684,variations in the period of xylem growth may be the cause of age dependent responses to climate
685,the observed shorter xylogenesis in older plants at the alpine timberline could be related to a size effect and not just to age per se
686,sweet potato ipomoea batatas l is the sixth most important food crop in the world
687,the formation and development of storage roots in sweet potato is a highly complicated and genetically programmed process
688,however the underlying mechanisms of storage root development have not yet been elucidated
689,to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in storage root development a combined analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of sweet potato fibrous roots f and storage roots at four different stages d d d and d was performed in the present study
690,a total of differentially expressed genes were identified in a comparison between the fibrous root library and four storage root libraries while proteins showed a fold or greater expression difference as indicated by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation itraq analysis
691,the combination of the transcriptome and proteome analyses and morphological and physiological data revealed several critical pathways involved in storage root formation and development
692,first genes proteins involved in the development of meristems cambia and starch biosynthesis were all significantly upregulated in storage roots compared with fibrous roots
693,second multiple phytohormones and the genes related to their biosynthesis showed differential expression between fibrous roots and storage roots
694,third a large number of transcription factors were differentially expressed during storage root initiation and development which suggests the importance of transcription factor regulation in the development of storage roots
695,fourth inconsistent gene expression was found between the transcriptome and proteome data which indicated posttranscriptional regulatory activity during the development of storage roots
696,overall these results reveal multiple events associated with storage root development and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory networks involved in storage root development
697,rooted leaves provide convenient material for investigating various physiological processes

700,sugar beet beta vulgaris and runner bean phaseolus coccineus
701,the storage root formed on a single sugar beet leaf develops concentric cambia suggesting that their formation is not determined by particular leaves
702,cambial variants represent a form of secondary growth that creates great stem anatomical diversity in lianas
703,despite the importance of cambial variants nothing is known about the developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems
704,here a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of bignonieae bignoniaceae was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns
705,we found that all species depart from a common developmental basis with a continuous regularly growing cambium
706,initial development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan
707,in most species the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them
708,other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges multiple dissected phloem wedges and included phloem wedges take place thereafter
709,the fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history
710,this recapitulation is however caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process
711,truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species which resemble juveniles of their ancestors as a result of a decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia
712,in addition the modular evolution of phloem and xylem in bignonieae seems to indicate that stem anatomical modifications in this group occurred at the level of cambial initials

716,the restriction fragment polymorphisms revealed by southern blot analysis suggest that etss is a single copy gene
717,the glycine at the th residue from the n terminal end of domain c has replaced alanine which is conserved among all the other ss sequences deposited in the genbank database
718,the n terminal residues of the hydrophilic sequence was expressed as a peptide tagged protein in e coli and the resultant bacterial crude extract was incubated with farnesyl diphosphate and nadph
719,gc ms analysis showed that squalene was detected in the in vitro reaction mixture
720,e tirucalli transgenic callus lines in which etss was overexpressed accumulated increased amounts of phytosterols as compared with that of wild type callus
721,rt pcr analysis of wild type e tirucalli plants revealed that the etss transcript accumulated in almost equal amounts in the stems and the leaves with a stalk while a lower amount was detected in the roots
722,in situ hybridization analysis revealed that prominent antisense probe signal was detected in the cambia within bundle sheathes
723,these results indicate that etss functions prominently in cambia which are located adjacent to conductive tubes and that this gene plays important roles in phytosterol accumulation in petroleum plants
724,both structural and functional properties of belowground plant organs are critical for the development and yield of plants but compared to the shoot much more difficult to observe due to soil opacity
725,many processes concerning the belowground plant performance are not fully understood in particular spatial and temporal dynamics and their interrelation with environmental factors
726,we used magnetic resonance imaging mri as a noninvasive method to evaluate which traits can be measured when a complex plant organ is monitored in vivo while growing in the soil
727,we chose sugar beet beta vulgaris ssp
728,vulgaris as a model system
729,the beet consists mainly of root tissues is rather complex regarding tissue structure and responses to environmental factors and thereby a good object to test the applicability of mri for d phenotyping approaches
730,over a time period of up to months traits such as beet morphology or anatomy were followed in the soil and the effect of differently sized pots on beet fresh weight calculated from mri data was studied
731,there was a clear positive correlation between the pot size and the increase in fresh weight of a sugar beet over time
732,since knowledge of the development of internal beet structures with several concentric cambia vascular and parenchyma rings is still limited we consecutively acquired d volumetric images on individual plants using the mri contrast parameter t to map the development of rings at the tissue level
733,this demonstrates that mri provides versatile protocols to non invasively measure plant traits in the soil
734,it opens new avenues to investigate belowground plant performance under adverse environmental conditions such as drought nutrient shortage or soil compaction to seek for traits of belowground organs making plants more resilient to stress
735,newer classes of targeted drugs for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis are more effective and more expensive than older classes posing a difficult and potentially costly decision about whether to use them as initial targeted treatments
736,to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of initial targeted treatment for the following drugs adalimumab etanercept and infliximab tnf inhibitors apremilast pde inhibitor ustekinumab il inhibitor and ixekizumab secukinumab and brodalumab il inhibitors
737,we developed a markov model to simulate patient outcomes as measured by quality adjusted life years qalys and health care costs over a year period
738,we assumed that patients who fail initial targeted treatment either proceed to subsequent therapy or discontinue targeted treatment
739,effectiveness estimates for initial treatment were defined as improvement in psoriasis area and severity index pasi from baseline and derived from a network meta analysis
740,wholesale acquisition drug costs were discounted by a class specific empirically derived rebate percentage off of costs
741,we conducted one way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess uncertainty in results
742,the incremental benefits compared with no targeted treatment were in descending order ixekizumab qalys credible range cr brodalumab qalys cr secukinumab qalys cr ustekinumab qalys cr infliximab qalys cr adalimumab qalys cr etanercept qalys cr and apremilast qalys cr
743,costs of care without targeted treatment totaled and costs of targeted treatment ranged from apremilast to ustekinumab
744,probabilistic sensitivity analysis results indicated that infliximab and apremilast are likely to be the most cost effective initial treatments at willingness to pay thresholds around per qaly while il drugs are more likely to be cost effective at thresholds approaching per qaly
745,acquisition cost of the initial targeted drug and utility of clinical response were the most influential parameters
746,our findings suggest that initial targeted treatment with il inhibitors is the most effective treatment strategy for plaque psoriasis patients who have failed methotrexate and phototherapy
747,apremilast brodalumab infliximab ixekizumab and secukinumab are cost effective at different willingness to pay thresholds
748,additional research is needed on whether the effectiveness of targeted agents changes when used after previously targeted agents
749,funding for this study was contributed by the institute for clinical and economic review icer
750,ollendorf chapman pearson and kumar are current employees and loos and liu are former employees of icer an independent organization that evaluates the evidence on the value of health care interventions which is funded by grants from the laura and john arnold foundation blue shield of california foundation and the california healthcare foundation

753,no other authors have potential conflicts of interest
754,as climatically suitable range projections become increasingly used to assess distributions of species we recommend systematic assessments of the quality of habitat in addition to the classical binary classification of habitat
755,we devised a method to assess occurrence probability captured by a climatic suitability index through which we could determine variations in the quality of potential habitat
756,this relative risk assessment circumvents the use of an arbitrary suitability threshold
757,we illustrated our method with case studies on invasive ant species
758,we estimated invasion potential of the destroyer ant monomorium destructor and the european fire ant myrmica rubra on a global scale currently and by with climate change
759,we found that of the world s landmass currently has a suitable climate for the destroyer ant and has a suitable climate for european fire ant
760,our climatic suitability index showed that both ant species would benefit from climate change but in different ways
761,the size of the potential distribution increased by for the destroyer ant
762,meanwhile the total area of potential distribution remained the same for the european fire ant but the level of climatic suitability within this range increased greatly and led to an improvement in habitat quality i e of invasive species establishment likelihood
763,either through quantity or quality of suitable areas both invasive ant species are likely to increase the extent of their invasion in the future following global climate change
764,our results show that species may increase their range if either more areas become suitable or if the available areas present improved suitability
765,studies in which an arbitrary suitability threshold was used may overlook changes in area quality within climatically suitable areas and as a result reach incorrect predictions
766,incremento de la cantidad y calidad de reas id neas para especies invasoras a medida que cambia el clima
767,cataphylls associated with the middle triassic stem genus antarcticycas are described and their impact on understanding cycad evolution is discussed
768,the cataphylls of antarcticycas are triangular in outline and flattened adaxially with lateral flanges
769,the outer surfaces are covered with a ramentum of filamentous hairs the epidermis is a single cell layer thick and the ground tissue is parenchymatous with mucilage canals and sclereids
770,vascular bundles form a distinct inverted omega shaped pattern characteristic of the cycadales observed in petioles of extant species
771,the structures in antarcticycas are interpreted as cataphylls based on overall morphology presence of straight vascular strands in the cortex of the associated stem and lack of fascicular cambia in the vascular bundles
772,because much of the overall diversity of cycadales is represented by fossils integrating fossil taxa into explicit phylogenetic hypotheses is important for understanding cycad evolution
773,therefore character and minimum age mapping were performed on a phylogeny of extant and fossil taxa including antarcticycas
774,the results suggest that major extant lineages of cycadales had diverged by the permian to triassic and that certain synapomorphies for cycadales had evolved by the permian
775,evidence of insect feeding on antarcticycas suggests that associations between cycads and insects are ancient
776,the morphology of the hypogeous root holoparasite hydnora triceps is highly reduced and as with many holoparasites the vegetative body is difficult to interpret
777,the vegetative body of h triceps has been historically considered a pilot root studded with lateral appendages known as haustorial roots
778,we found the vegetative body of h triceps to consist of a rhizome with a thickened root cap like structure that covered a vegetative shoot apical meristem
779,from the apical meristem procambial strands originated and developed into endarch collateral vascular bundles arranged radially around a pith without an interfascicular cambium
780,xylem vessels had scalariform pitting and simple perforation plates
781,a continuous periderm without root hairs was observed
782,increase in girth was attributed to cork and fascicular cambia
783,haustorial roots or bumps on the surface of the vegetative body were exogenous contained meristems and were the origins of vegetative branching budding and haustoria
784,the haustoria of h triceps were cylindrical and penetrated the host root stele
785,phloem and xylem elements were observed within the endophyte and direct xylem to host xylem contacts were observed
786,the arrangement of vascular tissues and xylem anatomy of h triceps are likely plesiomorphic features in light of hydnoraceae s placement in the piperales
787,sucrose synthase ss was the dominant enzyme of sucrose metabolism in both stem and root vascular cambial zone tissues of nursery grown loblolly pine pinus taeda l seedlings
788,acid invertase ai and neutral invertase nt activities were generally less than of the ss activity in both tissues
789,in both cambial tissues seasonal patterns of enzyme activity were observed for ss but not for ai or ni
790,the seasonal patterns of ss activity in stem and root cambia paralleled the periodic growth of stems and roots
791,stems had high ss activity and growth during summer and early fall
792,roots had substantial ss activity and growth during summer and fall but ss activity and growth were even higher in winter
793,when seedlings were transplanted about eight months elapsed before stem and root cambia resumed rates of growth and sucrose metabolism similar to those in control nontransplanted seedlings
794,two months after transplanting root ss was at its lowest whereas ai activity in transplants was higher than in control nontransplanted seedlings
795,in stems ss activity decreased in response to transplanting whereas ai and ni activities did not change appreciably
796,in loblolly pine tissues ss was specific for uridylates whereas the nucleotide triphosphate dependent phosphofructokinase ntp pfk had similar activity with either utp or atp
797,except in winter the ntp pfk was less active than the pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase ppi pfk during all seasons
798,the ppi dependent pfk activity in nontransplanted seedlings followed similar seasonal and spatial patterns to those of ss activity
799,in actively growing tissues such as stem cambial tissues in summer and root cambial tissues in winter the measured total pfk to ss ratio ranged between and
800,in contrast in less actively growing tissues or transplanted seedlings a greater decrease occurred in ss than in pfk activity hence the ratio rose to as high as
801,it was concluded that ss was the dominant enzyme for sucrose metabolism in root and stem cambial tissues of loblolly pine seedlings both ss and ppi pfk in the cambial tissues can be used as biochemical indicators of growth sink strength in stems and roots and both enzymes can be used as indicators of seedling stress caused by events such as transplanting and winter freezing
802,responses of cambium to warming were recorded three times december january february and february march on year old cryptomeria japonica d don and four times december january february february march and march april on year old larix leptolepis gord during a period of winter cambial dormancy
803,stem surfaces at breast height mid tree height and the crown base were warmed to degrees c for weeks
804,after heat treatment cambia in the treated regions and in untreated regions m above each treated area were examined by optical and transmission electron microscopy tem
805,in c japonica heat treatment often resulted in cambial reactivation in the treated regions and this response to heat gradually increased as the dormant season passed from winter to spring
806,conversely in l leptolepis no cell division was observed in the cambial region of warmed stems until natural resumption of cambial activity which occurred after bud break
807,during their lifetime tree stems take a series of successive nested shapes
808,individual tree growth models traditionally focus on apical growth and architecture
809,however cambial growth which is distributed over a surface layer wrapping the whole organism equally contributes to plant form and function
810,this study aims at providing a framework to simulate how organism shape evolves as a result of a secondary growth process that occurs at the cellular scale
811,the development of the vascular cambium is modelled as an expanding surface using the level set method
812,the surface consists of multiple compartments following distinct expansion rules
813,growth behaviour can be formulated as a mathematical function of surface state variables and independent variables to describe biological processes
814,the model was coupled to an architectural model and to a forest stand model to simulate cambium dynamics and wood formation at the scale of the organism
815,the model is able to simulate competition between cambia surface irregularities and local features
816,predicting the shapes associated with arbitrarily complex growth functions does not add complexity to the numerical method itself
817,despite their slenderness it is sometimes useful to conceive of trees as expanding surfaces
818,the proposed mathematical framework provides a way to integrate through time and space the biological and physical mechanisms underlying cambium activity
819,it can be used either to test growth hypotheses or to generate detailed maps of wood internal structure
820,conifers are characterized by the paucity of axillary buds which in dicotyledonous trees usually occur at every node
821,to compensate conifers also produce axillary meristems which may be stimulated to late development
822,in juvenile material of wollemia nobilis araucariaceae massart s model first order plagiotropic branches lack both axillary buds and seemingly axillary meristems
823,this contrasts with orthotropic trunk axes which produce branches either within the terminal bud or as reiterated orthotropic axes originating from axillary meristems
824,however plagiotropic axes do produce branches if they are decapitated
825,this study investigated how this can occur if axillary meristems are not the source
826,the terminal buds of a series of plagiotropic branches on juvenile trees were decapitated in order to generate axillary shoots
827,shoots were culled at about weekly intervals to obtain stages in lateral shoot development
828,serial sections were cut with a sliding microtome from the distal end of each sample and scanned sequentially for evidence of axillary meristems and early bud development
829,anatomical search produced no clear evidence of pre existing axillary meristems but did reveal stages of bud initiation
830,buds were initiated in a group of small starch rich cortical cells
831,further development involved de differentiation of these small cells and the development of contrasting outer and inner regions
832,the outer part becomes meristematic and organizes the apex of the new branch
833,the inner part develops a callus like tissue of vacuolated cells within which vascular cambia are developed
834,this kind of insertion of a branch on the parent axis seems not to have been described before
835,axillary meristems in wollemia characterize the leaf axils of trunk axes so that the origin of reiterated shoots is clear
836,plagiotropic axes seemingly lack axillary meristems but still produce axillary branches by distinctive developmental processes
837,these observations demonstrate limited understanding of branch initiation in trees generally
838,the differentiation of phloem anastomoses linking the longitudinal vascular bundles has been studied in stem internodes of cucurbita maxima duchesne c pepo l and dahlia pinnata cav
839,these anastomoses comprise naturally occurring regenerative sieve tubes which redifferentiate from interfascicular parenchyma cells in the young internodes
840,in all three species severing a vascular bundle in a young internode resulted in regeneration of xylem to form a curved by pass immediately around the wound
841,the numerous phloem anastomoses in these young internodes were not involved in this process the regenerated vessels originating from interfascicular parenchyma alone
842,conversely in mature internodes of dahlia the regenerated vessels originated from initials of the interfascicular cambia and their phloem anastomoses did not influence the pattern of xylogenesis
843,on the other hand in old internodes of cucurbita in which an interfascicular cambium was not yet developed the parenchyma cells between the bundles had lost the ability to redifferentiate into vessel elements and instead regenerated vessels were produced in the phloem anastomoses
844,thus the wounded region of the vascular bundle was not bypassed via the shortest curved pathway but by more circuitous routes further away from the wound
845,some of the regenerated vessels produced in the phloem anastomoses were extremely wide and presumably efficient conductors of water
846,it is proposed that the dense network of phloem anastomoses developed during evolution as a mechanism of adaptation to possible damage in mature internodes by providing flexible alternative pathways for efficient xylem regeneration in plants with limited or no interfascicular cambium
847,the plasmodesmal pd network in the cambial zone of arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls was analysed using electron microscopy and dye coupling studies and compared to those of internodes of populus nigra and solanum lycopersicum
848,in all species pd densities and frequencies undergo alterations in topologically successive cambial walls reflecting species specific patterns of pd degradation and pd insertion during cell development
849,longitudinal pd fission is responsible for an abrupt increment of pd numbers in specific walls of the youngest derivatives at the xylem and or phloem side
850,here pds seem to mediate positional signalling to control tissue fate and early cell determination
851,pd numbers at all cambial interfaces of a thaliana correspond to those of the herbaceous tomato but are higher with the woody poplar
852,this suggests a positive correlation between pd frequencies and the rapidity of cell division activity
853,photoactivated green fluorescent protein kda did not diffuse through cambial pds of a thaliana
854,this is in keeping with the common size exclusion limit sel of kda observed for pds at the youngest interfaces of tomato and poplar which may mediate diffusive exchange of developmental signals of equal molecular size
855,the regular growth patterns in internodal cambial zones of poplar and tomato result from synchronized cell division activity of neighbouring initials
856,a thaliana hypocotyls have an irregular mode of secondary growth
857,here signalling through pds in misaligned radial walls between non homologous derivatives may control tissue development
858,the observed organizational differences between the cambia cast doubts on the suitability of a thaliana as a model plant for cambial research
859,the vascular cambium produces secondary xylem and phloem in plants and is responsible for wood formation in forest trees
860,in this study we used a microscale mass spectrometry technique coupled with cryosectioning to visualize the radial concentration gradient of endogenous indole acetic acid iaa across the cambial meristem and the differentiating derivatives in scots pine pinus sylvestris l trees that had different rates of cambial growth
861,this approach allowed us to investigate the relationship between growth rate and the concentration of endogenous iaa in the dividing cells
862,we also tested the hypothesis that iaa is a positional signal in xylem development c uggla t moritz g sandberg b sundberg proc natl acad sci usa
863,this idea postulates that the width of the radial concentration gradient of iaa regulates the radial number of dividing cells in the cambial meristem which is an important component for determining cambial growth rate
864,the relationship between iaa concentration in the dividing cells and growth rate was poor although the highest iaa concentration was observed in the fastest growing cambia
865,the radial width of the iaa concentration gradient showed a strong correlation with cambial growth rate
866,the results indicate that iaa gives positional information in plants
867,rapidly developing tumours at hypocotyls of ricinus communis induced by agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c were characterized by strong differentiation of vascular bundles and their functional connection to the host bundles
868,the stem tumour interface showed increased xylem with numerous vessels accompanied by multiseriate unlignified rays
869,to know how nutrients efficiently accumulate in the tumour sink tissue cell electropotentials e m in cross sections were mapped
870,the measured cells were identified by injected lucifer yellow
871,xylem and phloem parenchyma cells and stem tumour located rays hyperpolarized to e m values of about mv which suggest high plasma membrane proton pump activities
872,rapidly dividing cells of cambia or small tumour parenchyma cells had low e m
873,the tumour aerenchyma and the stem cortex cells displayed values close to the energy independent diffusion potential
874,the lowest values were recorded in stem pith cells
875,cell k concentrations largely matched the respective e m
876,the pattern of individual cell electropotentials was supplemented by whole organ voltage measurements
877,the voltage differences between the tumour surface and the xylem perfusion solution in stems attached to the tumours the trans tumour electropotentials ttp confirm the findings of respiration dependent and phytohormone stimulated high plasma membrane proton pump activity in intact tumours mainly in the xylem and phloem parenchyma and ray cells
878,ttps were inhibited by addition of nan cn plus sham or n gas in the xylem perfusion solution and by external n flushing
879,the data provide functional evidence for the structural basis of priority over the host shoot in nutrient flow from the stem to the tumour
880,cassava is an important tropical root crop adapted to a wide range of environmental stimuli such as drought and acid soils
881,nevertheless it is an extremely cold sensitive tropical species
882,thus far there is limited information about gene regulation and signalling pathways related to the cold stress response in cassava
883,the development of microarray technology has accelerated the study of global transcription profiling under certain conditions
884,a mer oligonucleotide microarray representing genes was used to perform transcriptome profiling in apical shoots of cassava subjected to cold at c for and h a total of transcripts were identified as early cold responsive genes in which sequences had functional descriptions when aligned with arabidopsis proteins
885,gene ontology annotation analysis identified many cold relevant categories including response to abiotic and biotic stimulus response to stress transcription factor activity and chloroplast
886,various stress associated genes with a wide range of biological functions were found such as signal transduction components e g map kinase transcription factors tfs e g rap and reactive oxygen species ros scavenging enzymes e g catalase as well as photosynthesis related genes e g psal
887,seventeen major tf families including many well studied members e g ap erebp were also involved in the early response to cold stress
888,meanwhile kegg pathway analysis uncovered many important pathways such as plant hormone signal transduction and starch and sucrose metabolism
889,furthermore the expression changes of genes under cold and other abiotic stress conditions were validated by real time rt pcr
890,importantly most of the tested stress responsive genes were primarily expressed in mature leaves stem cambia and fibrous roots rather than apical buds and young leaves
891,as a response to cold stress in cassava an increase in transcripts and enzyme activities of ros scavenging genes and the accumulation of total soluble sugars including sucrose and glucose were also detected
892,the dynamic expression changes reflect the integrative controlling and transcriptome regulation of the networks in the cold stress response of cassava
893,the biological processes involved in the signal perception and physiological response might shed light on the molecular mechanisms related to cold tolerance in tropical plants and provide useful candidate genes for genetic improvement
894,to elucidate the composition structure of annual rings and the formation process of anomalous structures in sophora flavescens and further discuss the medicinal parts of s flavescens
895,based on investigation on s flavescens in its producing areas the morphology of root systems was observed and the developmental anatomy of roots was researched
896,creeping underground rhizomes of s flavescen existed in some parts of the north place there were many differences in appearance characters and microscopic features between these roots and rhizomes
897,parenchyma cells in secondary xylem regained meristematic ability became into anomalous cambia and then developed into anomalous structures
898,annual rings in transverse section of s flavescens were not actually growth rings they were made up of anomalous parenchyma girdle in secondary xylem and normal secondary structure
899,roots are the medicinal parts of s flavescens
900,this paper suggests that annual rings in the decoction pieces of s flavescens should be called annular structure

926,in the belief that a decrease in the rate of population growth will increase economic development more than ten countries have inaugurated family planning programs in the past fifteen years
927,to provide a model for measuring the immediate intermediate and long term effects of any such program the authors use the taiwan evaluation the model suggests that a good system of evaluation should include monthly statistics on participants who are grouped by characteristics the distribution of supplies reported at first by the characteristics of recipients but after by gross volume only family planning activities of private physicians to measure the catalytic effect on the private sector new contacts and amount of advertising in mass media costs broken down by areas and by cost categories and distribution of commercial supplies
928,in addition the program should conduct interviews every months to learn the rates of continuation and the rates and reasons for discontinuation
929,finally a kap survey should be conducted every two years the administration of the evaluation should be close to the director for policy decisions and for the ultimate work of evaluation the finding of new ways to measure the main goal of change in fertility by the translation of statistics on services provided and commercial supplies into birth rate data
930,the effects of graded doses of aspirin acetylsalicylic acid and cataflam potassium diclofenac on serum aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase nucleotidase methaemoglobin total and conjaged bilirubin were investigated in wistar rats
931,results showed a significant increase p in the levels of alanine animotransferase aspartate amino transferase methaemoglobin total and conjugated bilirubin upon treatment of animals with both drugs
932,aspirin significantly decreased p p the activity of alkaline phsophatase but increased the activity of ucleotidase while cataflam significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase p and nucletodase p
933,these effects were however dose dependent and the biochemical implications of these results are discussed
934,in this study we apply a battery of molecular similarity techniques to known inhibitors of kynurenine monooxygenase kmo querying each against a repository of approved experimental nutraceutical and illicit drugs
935,four compounds are assayed against kmo
936,subsequently diclofenac also known by the trade names voltaren voltarol aclonac and cataflam has been confirmed as a human kmo protein binder and inhibitor in cell lysate with low micromolar
937,after oral and maxillo facial surgical interventions both apranax and cataflam proved to be satisfying against pain
938,though there is no difference in the kinetics of the effect we found apranax more effective to relieve postoperative pain
939,besides the fast elimination of pain the medicine significantly mitigate the symptoms of inflammation
940,the purpose of this single blind placebo controlled arm parallel randomized study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of mg diclofenac potassium cataflam novartis stein switzerland mg diclofenac sodium softgel and placebo in patients experiencing moderate to severe postoperative pain after third molar extraction
941,seventy five patients female with a mean age of age range to years participated in the study following removal of at least impacted mandibular third molar
942,patients received a single dose of study medication when their postoperative pain reached a moderate or severe intensity
943,analgesic efficacy measures included the time to meaningful pain relief measured using a stopwatch and time to rescue medication
944,pain relief pr and pain intensity pi ratings were recorded at and hours postdosing
945,summary analgesic measures including summed pain relief score totpar and summed pain intensity differences spid were calculated from the to hour responses
946,the time between pain relief and rescue and a global evaluation for the effectiveness of the study medications were recorded at the end of the study
947,seven scheduled blood samples were collected from each patient for determining plasma concentrations of diclofenac anion
948,both diclofenac sodium softgel and cataflam were significantly more effective than placebo p for all summary analgesic measures
949,the average overall pain relief was substantially better from diclofenac sodium softgel than from cataflam but the difference was not statistically significant p
950,in patients taking diclofenac sodium softgel of the patients experienced a time to onset of analgesic activity within minutes and the median analgesic duration was hours minutes
951,fifty percent of the patients taking cataflam had a time to onset of action within minutes and the median duration of analgesia was hours minutes
952,at the time of rescue drug administration or hours whichever was earlier of the patients given diclofenac sodium softgel rated the medication as a very good or excellent pain reliever whereas only of the patients taking cataflam gave these ratings
953,no serious adverse events were observed in this study
954,the mean concentrations of diclofenac from the diclofenac sodium softgel formulation were significantly different from the cataflam formulation
955,the mean c max for the softgel was almost twice that of cataflam and c max was reached an hour earlier on average
956,more diclofenac anion was absorbed at a quicker rate using the formulation diclofenac sodium softgel mg than cataflam
957,the softgel provided a very rapid onset of analgesic activity a prolonged analgesic duration and an acceptable side effect profile in the postoperative third molar surgery pain model
958,in an acute pain situation the rapid absorption of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs from a formulation like the softgel may positively affect the time of onset and duration of inflammatory pain compared with other commercially available nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug formulations
959,this study aimed to investigate the gastrointestinal supersaturation and precipitation behavior of a weakly acidic biopharmaceutics classification system bcs class ii drug in healthy volunteers
960,for this purpose a tablet containing mg diclofenac potassium cataflam was predissolved in ml of water and this solution was subsequently orally administered to five healthy volunteers under fasted and fed state conditions with or without concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor ppi mg esomeprazole nexiam
961,subsequently total diclofenac content and dissolved intraluminal drug concentrations as well as drug thermodynamic solubility were determined in gastrointestinal aspirates
962,in all volunteers gastric supersaturation resulted in precipitation of diclofenac in the stomach
963,the extent of precipitation correlated well with gastric ph r
964,ph dependency of precipitation was corroborated by the absence of precipitate in the stomach after coadministration of a meal and or a ppi
965,diclofenac was found to be fully dissolved in the duodenum in all test conditions
966,it can be concluded that substantial ph dependent gastric precipitation of a weakly acidic bcs class ii drug administered as a solution occurs in humans
967,with regard to its implications for intestinal absorption results suggest the instantaneous redissolution of gastric drug precipitate upon transfer to the duodenum
968,this study aimed to gain further insight into the gastrointestinal disposition of the weakly acidic bcs class ii drug diclofenac and the implications for systemic drug exposure in humans under fasted and fed state conditions
969,for this purpose gastrointestinal and blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers after oral intake of a commercially available tablet of the potassium salt of diclofenac i e cataflam in different prandial states
970,subsequently these in vivo data served as a reference for the evaluation of in vitro tools with different levels of complexity i e a conventional usp ii dissolution apparatus a modified version of the dynamic open flow through test apparatus and the tno gastrointestinal model equipped with the recently developed advanced gastric compartment timagc
971,in vivo data suggested impaired drug dissolution and or immediate precipitation in the fasted stomach linked to the acidity of the gastric environment
972,similarly a vast presence of solid drug material in the stomach was observed under fed state conditions which could be attributed to a marked delay in intragastric tablet disintegration after drug intake with a meal
973,emptying of solid drug from the stomach into the duodenum generally resulted in rapid intestinal drug re dissolution in both test conditions explaining the absence of a food effect on the extent of overall systemic exposure for diclofenac
974,in vitro tools were found to be capable of predicting in vivo intraluminal and systemic disposition of this compound the extent of which depended on the degree to which the dynamic nature of the gastrointestinal process es to be investigated was simulated

999,hp cd diclofenac was safe and well tolerated following iv and im administration
1000,this study investigated gastrointestinal drug concentrations of the weakly acidic drug diclofenac when dosed to healthy volunteers after intake of the fda standard meal
1001,in gastrointestinal aspiration studies postprandial conditions are usually achieved using liquid or homogenized meals
1002,however these liquid meals may have a substantially different impact on the gastrointestinal physiology compared to a solid meal
1003,to evaluate the effect of a solid meal on the gastrointestinal behavior of diclofenac five healthy volunteers were recruited into a clinical study
1004,twenty minutes prior to diclofenac ingestion cataflam mg of potassium diclofenac the volunteers were asked to eat a solid meal with the following composition corresponding to the fda standard meal eggs bacon strips toasts ounces of hash brown potatoes and ounces of milk
1005,gastric and duodenal fluids were collected as a function of time and blood samples were collected to link the gastrointestinal behavior to systemic exposure
1006,in vivo observations were complemented with in vitro research to obtain a mechanistic understanding of diclofenac s intraluminal behavior
1007,ingestion of the solid meal resulted in intraluminal ph profiles similar to earlier studies with a liquid meal
1008,however intraluminal drug disposition differed
1009,in the stomach a substantial fraction of diclofenac appeared dissolved despite an unfavorable acidic ph
1010,successive in vitro tests suggested that the dissolution of diclofenac is higher in the complex gastric medium resulting from fda standard meal ingestion compared to liquid meal ingestion
1011,despite the favorable ph and in contrast to a previous study with a liquid meal significant amounts of non dissolved diclofenac were observed in the intestine
1012,further in vitro tests revealed adsorption of dissolved diclofenac molecules to bacon fragments present in the fda standard meal
1013,this adsorption negatively affected the permeation of diclofenac across a physical barrier suggesting that in vivo absorption is affected as well
1014,being the first time a gastrointestinal aspiration study is combined with the administration of a solid meal the present study demonstrates that the intraluminal behavior of diclofenac and possibly other drugs heavily depends on the consistency and composition of the accompanied meal
1015,this paper reports the results of a pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers and designed to characterise the rate and extent of diclofenac absorption after the administration of a single dose of diclofenac cas potassium salt mg in sachet voltfast and tablet cataflam formulations
1016,timed plasma concentrations of diclofenac during a h period after dosing were measured by means of hplc with uv detection at nm and a quantification limit of ng ml the method was fully validated for pharmacokinetic purposes
1017,these plasma concentrations were used to calculate cmax tmax trapezoidal auc t and auc infinity and t by means of noncompartmental analysis
1018,cmax and tmax are the parameters expressing the rate of absorption whereas the aucs reflect the extent of absorption
1019,the rate of absorption with the sachets proved to be very fast reaching peak values at min in seven subjects and at min in the remaining subjects mean time was min with concentrations at min being of cmax
1020,the average time to peak concentration with the tablets was min
1021,the extent of absorption of the sachets and tablets was similar with auc infinity values of respectively and ng ml h and a confidence interval the highly soluble potassium salt of diclofenac was rapidly absorbed especially in its sachet formulation and thus appears to be an invaluable analgesic agent that is particularly useful for quick pain relief

1048,geometric mean test reference individual ratios were for auc h for auc infinity for cmax for ke and for t
1049,the variability of cmax parameter expressed as cv was greater than
1050,since the ci for auc h mean ratio were within the interval proposed by the food and drug administration it can be concluded that diclofenac free acid formulation is bioequivalent to diclofenac resinate formulation for the extent of absorption
1051,since the european community agency accepts a ci for cmax of it can be concluded that diclofenac free acid formulation is bioequivalent to diclofenac resinate formulation for both the rate and the extent of absorption after single dose administration

1176,furthermore the effects of ph and temperature on dcf oxidation by fe vi were elucidated using a systematic examination
1177,the apparent second order rate constants kapp increased significantly from to m s as the ph of the solution decreased from to and the acid base equilibriums of fe vi and dcf were proposed to explain the ph dependence of kapp
1178,the acute toxicity of dcf solution during fe vi oxidation was evaluated using a microtox bioassay
1179,overall the dcf degradation process resulted in a rapid increase of the inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria
1180,these toxicity tests suggest that the formation of enhanced toxic intermediates during the fe vi disinfection process may pose potential health risk to consumers
1181,the aim of this study was to prepare fast disintegrating tablets fdts of diclofenac potassium with sufficient integrity as well as a pleasant taste using two different fillers and binders tablettose and di pac
1182,tablets were made with direct compression method
1183,tablet properties such as porosity hardness and disintegration time were determined
1184,diclofenac potassium determinations were carried out using a validated spectrophotometric method for the analysis of drug
1185,furthermore in vivo experiments were carried out to compare the analgesic effect and the time to relieve migraine headache between the commercial tablets and fdts of diclofenac potassium against placebo
1186,results showed that fdts of diclofenac potassium with durable structure and desirable taste can be prepared using both fillers and binders but tablets prepared with di pac had a better taste so the tablet formulation containing di pac was chosen for in vivo experiments
1187,placebo controlled in vivo trial demonstrated that mg diclofenac potassium administered as a single dose of fdts or commercial tablets was effective in relieving the pain and both of them were superior to placebo
1188,diclofenac potassium powder for oral solution voltfast catafast cambia hereafter referred to as diclofenac potassium powder is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine
1189,this article reviews the pharmacological properties of diclofenac potassium powder and its efficacy and tolerability in patients with acute migraine
1190,diclofenac potassium powder was clinically efficacious and generally well tolerated in placebo controlled trials in patients with this indication it was more effective than diclofenac potassium tablets with regard to the primary endpoint of h pain relief as well as in several important secondary endpoints such as time to onset of analgesic action
1191,the oral powder for solution formulation of diclofenac potassium is a useful option in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura
1192,two different salts of diclofenac diclofenac sodium and diclofenac potassium in tablet dosage form were tested for their bioavailability and disposition kinetics in a group of eighteen rabbits in normal and experimentally induced dehydrated conditions with a wash out period of days between both stages of study
1193,biochemical and physiological parameters were also measured in both normal and dehydrated states

1201,kcnq and kcnq potassium channel subunits are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells although it remains uncertain how these subunits assemble to form functional channels
1202,using patch clamp techniques we compared the electrophysiological characteristics and effects of diclofenac a known kcnq channel activator on human kcnq and kcnq channels expressed individually or together in ar rat aortic smooth muscle cells
1203,the conductance curves of the overexpressed channels were fitted by a single boltzmann function in each case v values and mv for kcnq kcnq and kcnq respectively
1204,diclofenac m inhibited kcnq channels reducing maximum conductance by but increased maximum conductance of kcnq channels by
1205,the opposite effects of diclofenac on kcnq and kcnq could not be attributed to the presence of a basic residue lysine in the voltage sensing domain of kcnq because mutation of this residue to neutral glycine the residue present in kcnq resulted in a more effective block of the channel
1206,differences in deactivation rates and distinct voltage dependent effects of diclofenac on channel activation and deactivation observed with each of the subunit combinations kcnq kcnq and kcnq were used as diagnostic tools to evaluate native kcnq currents in vascular smooth muscle cells
1207,ar cells express only kcnq channels endogenously and their responses to diclofenac closely resembled those of the overexpressed kcnq currents
1208,in contrast mesenteric artery myocytes which express both kcnq and kcnq channels displayed whole cell kcnq currents with properties and diclofenac responses characteristic of overexpressed heteromeric kcnq channels
1209,to compare the pharmacokinetics of and food effect on diclofenac potassium delivered as an oral solution vs an immediate release tablet
1210,diclofenac potassium for oral solution is the only nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug approved as monotherapy for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults years of age or older
1211,it is formulated with potassium bicarbonate as a buffering agent to raise the ph and consequently increase the aqueous solubility of diclofenac in the acidic environment of the stomach following oral administration
1212,the dosage is mg of powdered diclofenac potassium dissolved in to ounces to ml of water prior to administration with dosing time in relation to food intake not specified this was the case for the pivotal efficacy and safety trials in subjects with acute migraine attacks in which the primary endpoints were achieved
1213,for acute treatment of migraine attacks rapid onset of pain relief is desirable and is likely related to a rapid appearance of an effective concentration of the drug in the systemic circulation
1214,the rate at which an orally administered drug reaches the blood is affected by both its formulation and the presence of food in the stomach
1215,the present study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of formulations of diclofenac potassium an immediate release tablet and an oral solution and to ascertain the effect of food

1229,auc values were similar between the formulations
1230,when taken under fasting conditions the oral solution exhibited a faster median tmax vs hours p to achieve a higher cmax mean sd ng ml vs p compared with the tablet
1231,auct and auc were similar between the formulations
1232,when taken under fed conditions the oral solution resulted in a similar median tmax vs hours p and lower cmax mean sd ng ml vs p compared with fasting conditions
1233,in comparison the tablets under fed conditions resulted in a statistically significantly delayed median tmax vs p and lower cmax mean sd ng ml vs p
1234,auc values were similar between fed and fasting conditions for both formulations
1235,twelve subjects experienced treatment emergent ae during the study
1236,all aes were mild and resolved without treatment none resulted in study discontinuation
1237,more treatment emergent aes were reported in subjects receiving the tablet compared with the solution formulation vs in fasting and vs in fed conditions
1238,diclofenac potassium oral solution and tablet formulations produced statistically significantly different cmax and tmax but similar auc under fed and fasting conditions
1239,fed conditions produced significantly lower cmax for both formulations and profoundly delayed tmax for the tablet but had no effect on tmax for the solution formulation
1240,these data provide insights into the importance of an earlier and greater exposure to diclofenac arising from the solution formulation than the tablet which may account for the superiority in the onset and sustained pain reduction for the solution than the tablet formulation observed in the double blind efficacy safety study in migraine patients conducted in europe

1355,sixty five patients were screened and patients mean sd age years mean sd weight kg female sex were included in the study each study group had patients
1356,after days both products were equally effective in relieving pain as measured by vas ir vs cr p ns and changes in the womac score ir vs cr p ns
1357,significantly more patients in the ir group reported feeling better after days than in the cr group vs p and according to the physician s opinion significantly more patients treated with diclofenac potassium ir felt better vs p
1358,significantly more patients in the ir group required rescue medication than those in the cr group vs p
1359,in the cr group patients experienced aes were gastrointestinal ie pyrosis epigastralgia dyspepsia and patient experienced increased arterial pressure
1360,one patient from this group discontinued treatment due to a lack of efficacy
1361,in the ir group patients experienced aes ie tachycardia epigastralgia and pyrosis
1362,one patient discontinued because of aes and withdrew due to a lack of efficacy
1363,based on the results from this small study in a venezuelan population both ir and cr formulations of diclofenac potassium have similar effectiveness and tolerability profiles
1364,this study assessed the efficacy of diclofenac potassium for oral solution a novel water soluble buffered powder formulation versus placebo for the acute treatment of migraine
1365,diclofenac potassium for oral solution has a time to maximum plasma concentration tmax of minutes suggesting the potential for a rapid onset of therapeutic effects
1366,this was a randomized double blind parallel group placebo controlled study conducted in us centers
1367,adult sufferers with an established migraine diagnosis according to the international classification of headache disorders second edition ichd ii treated one moderate or severe attack with mg diclofenac potassium for oral solution dissolved in approximately ounces of water n or matching placebo n
1368,four co primary endpoints included the percentage of subjects who at two hours post treatment reported no headache pain no nausea no photophobia and or no phonophobia
1369,significantly more subjects treated with diclofenac potassium for oral solution n achieved a two hour pain free response vs p no nausea vs p no photophobia vs p and no phonophobia vs p compared to placebo
1370,pain intensity differences between treatments were significantly lower in the diclofenac potassium oral solution group starting at minutes post treatment p with significant differences at all time points thereafter p
1371,twenty four hour sustained pain free response favored diclofenac potassium oral solution treatment versus placebo vs p
1372,the most common adverse event considered to be treatment related was nausea diclofenac potassium for oral solution placebo
1373,this study shows that this formulation of diclofenac potassium for oral solution is effective in reducing pain intensity within minutes which may be related to the minute t max associated with this formulation
1374,the rapid onset benefits were sustained through hours post treatment
1375,this study aimed to gain further insight into the gastrointestinal disposition of the weakly acidic bcs class ii drug diclofenac and the implications for systemic drug exposure in humans under fasted and fed state conditions
1376,for this purpose gastrointestinal and blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers after oral intake of a commercially available tablet of the potassium salt of diclofenac i e cataflam in different prandial states
1377,subsequently these in vivo data served as a reference for the evaluation of in vitro tools with different levels of complexity i e a conventional usp ii dissolution apparatus a modified version of the dynamic open flow through test apparatus and the tno gastrointestinal model equipped with the recently developed advanced gastric compartment timagc
1378,in vivo data suggested impaired drug dissolution and or immediate precipitation in the fasted stomach linked to the acidity of the gastric environment
1379,similarly a vast presence of solid drug material in the stomach was observed under fed state conditions which could be attributed to a marked delay in intragastric tablet disintegration after drug intake with a meal
1380,emptying of solid drug from the stomach into the duodenum generally resulted in rapid intestinal drug re dissolution in both test conditions explaining the absence of a food effect on the extent of overall systemic exposure for diclofenac
1381,in vitro tools were found to be capable of predicting in vivo intraluminal and systemic disposition of this compound the extent of which depended on the degree to which the dynamic nature of the gastrointestinal process es to be investigated was simulated
1382,diclofenac dic a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug is known to exert anti nociceptive and anti convulsant actions however its effects on ion currents in neurons remain debatable
1383,we aimed to investigate potential effects of diclofenac on membrane potential and potassium currents in differentiated nsc neuronal cells and dorsal root ganglion drg neurons with whole cell patch clamp technology and firing of action potentials aps using a simulation model from hippocampal ca pyramidal neurons based on diclofenac s effects on potassium currents
1384,in the nsc cells diclofenac exerted an inhibitory effect on delayed rectifier k current i kdr with an ic value of m
1385,diclofenac not merely inhibited the i kdr amplitude in response to membrane depolarization but also accelerated the process of current inactivation
1386,the inhibition by diclofenac of ik dr was not reversed by subsequent application of either naloxone
1387,importantly diclofenac m increased the amplitude of m type k current i km while flupirtine m or meclofenamic acid m enhanced it effectively
1388,consistently diclofenac m increased the amplitude of i km and diminished the i kdr amplitude with a shortening of inactivation time constant in drg neurons
1389,furthermore by using the simulation modeling we demonstrated the potential electrophysiological mechanisms underlying changes in ap firing caused by diclofenac
1390,during the exposure to diclofenac the actions on both i km and i kdr could be potential mechanism through which it influences the excitability of fast spiking neurons
1391,caution needs to be made in attributing the effects of diclofenac primarily to those produced by the activation of i km
1392,literature data are reviewed regarding the scientific advisability of allowing a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence be testing for the approval of immediate release ir solid oral dosage forms containing either diclofenac potassium and diclofenac sodium
1393,within the biopharmaceutics classification system bcs diclofenac potassium and diclofenac sodium are each bcs class ii active pharmaceutical ingredients apis

1395,the nsaid diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis and an established antipyretic and analgesic agent
1396,diclofenac potassium was developed as an immediate release tablet with the aim of providing rapid onset of action after oral administration
1397,this formulation has been investigated in the acute treatment of migraine
1398,data from available placebo controlled clinical trials indicate that diclofenac potassium or mg as an immediate release tablet is more effective than placebo and as effective as oral sumatriptan mg and ergotamine plus caffeine at reducing pain intensity in patients with migraine hours after initial administration
1399,duration of pain relief is similar for the drugs but onset appears to be faster with diclofenac potassium than with oral sumatriptan or ergotamine plus caffeine
1400,diclofenac potassium appears to have favourable effects on some accompanying symptoms such as nausea and vomiting
1401,the frequency of these symptoms was significantly lower with diclofenac potassium than with sumatriptan in study although only a few patients had vomiting at baseline
1402,effects on phonophobia or photophobia did not differ between diclofenac potassium sumatriptan and ergotamine plus caffeine
1403,the need for rescue medication is consistently less with diclofenac potassium than with placebo
1404,data are inconsistent or scarce regarding the effects of diclofenac potassium versus placebo on other measures such as headache recurrence and working ability
1405,diclofenac potassium was generally well tolerated in clinical trials in patients with migraine
1406,adverse events reported most frequently abdominal pain tiredness and fatigue and nausea were typically mild to moderate
1407,diclofenac potassium provides rapid pain relief within to minutes is well tolerated and reduces the frequency of some of the accompanying symptoms in patients with migraine
1408,available trials indicate that diclofenac potassium provides similar pain relief to sumatriptan and is at least as effective as ergotamine plus caffeine but appears to have a greater effect on nausea and vomiting than sumatriptan and a faster onset of action than both drugs
1409,comparisons with other nsaids are lacking
1410,diclofenac potassium is likely to find a role as a useful first line option in the acute treatment of migraine
1411,a double blind placebo controlled parallel group study was performed to compare the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac potassium or mg with that of aspirin mg or placebo
1412,two hundred fifty five inpatients with severe postepisiotomy pain were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of one of the four active treatments or placebo
1413,analgesia was assessed over an hour period
1414,treatments were compared on the basis of standard scales for pain intensity and relief and a number of derived variables based on these data as well as two global ratings of the study medication
1415,all active treatments were effective analgesics statistically superior to placebo for many hourly and summary measures including the global ratings
1416,diclofenac potassium and mg was statistically significantly superior to aspirin at half hour and for many other hourly scores from hour on
1417,the and hour sum of the pain intensity difference and total pain relief scores reflected the superiority of diclofenac potassium to aspirin
1418,in addition the mg dose was significantly more efficacious than the mg dose of diclofenac potassium
1419,the probability of obtaining onset was significantly better for all active treatments than for placebo however the median onset times were similar for all treatments
1420,the duration of effect as measured by mean pain intensity difference and relief scores was better for diclofenac potassium than aspirin and these differences were significant for the and mg doses
1421,the probability of pain returning to baseline was significantly less for the diclofenac groups than for placebo or aspirin groups
1422,in addition significantly fewer patients treated with diclofenac or mg or aspirin mg required remedication during the hour study period as compared with those treated with placebo
1423,diclofenac potassium is an effective analgesic in the range of aspirin mg at the mg dose and superior in efficacy and longer lasting than aspirin at the and mg doses
1424,the onset of analgesia was similar for aspirin and diclofenac potassium
1425,to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsules dpsgc using patented prosorb dispersion technology with an immediate release diclofenac potassium mg comparator tablet in two open label single dose randomized crossover relative bioavailability studies in healthy volunteers
1426,in study volunteers n received dpsgc mg or a diclofenac potassium mg comparator tablet in two inpatient study periods
1427,in study n volunteers received dpsgc mg dpsgc mg or a diclofenac potassium mg comparator immediate release tablet in three inpatient study periods
1428,in both studies dpsgc mg displayed a significantly shorter t max and higher c max than the mg diclofenac potassium comparator tablet
1429,dpsgc mg study produced a shorter t max h and an equivalent c max ng ml to the mg comparator drug
1430,plasma diclofenac concentration time courses for the diclofenac potassium mg comparator tablet showed many low delayed or multiple peaks compared with dpsgc treatments
1431,dpsgc mg and mg were more rapidly and consistently absorbed than diclofenac potassium mg comparator tablets
1432,the c max of dpsgc mg was equivalent to the mg diclofenac potassium comparator tablet
1433,these characteristics may be beneficial when fast consistent drug absorption is needed
1434,the objective of our study was to develop controlled drug delivery system based on erythrocyte ghosts for amphiphilic compound sodium diclofenac considering the differences between erythrocytes derived from two readily available materials porcine slaughterhouse and outdated transfusion human blood
1435,starting erythrocytes empty erythrocyte ghosts and diclofenac loaded ghosts were compared in terms of the encapsulation efficiency drug releasing profiles size distribution surface charge conductivity surface roughness and morphology
1436,the encapsulation of sodium diclofenac was performed by an osmosis based process gradual hemolysis
1437,during this process sodium diclofenac exerted mild and delayed antihemolytic effect and increased potassium efflux in porcine but not in outdated human erythrocytes
1438,ftir spectra revealed lack of any membrane lipid disorder and chemical reaction with sodium diclofenac in encapsulated ghosts
1439,outdated human erythrocyte ghosts with detected nanoscale damages and reduced ability to shrink had encapsulation efficiency of only
1440,on the other hand porcine erythrocyte ghosts had encapsulation efficiency of and relatively slow drug release rate
1441,more preserved structure and functional properties of porcine erythrocytes related to their superior encapsulation and release performances define them as more appropriate for the usage in sodium diclofenac encapsulation process
1442,nsaids are widely used for patients presenting with low back pain
1443,a quick release formulation of lornoxicam a potent nsaid from the chemical class of oxicams offers a faster onset of pain relief compared with the standard tablet formulation
1444,time to onset of pain relief with lornoxicam was compared with the quick release formulation of diclofenac potassium in acute low back pain in a randomised double blind multicentre study
1445,patients received either lornoxicam mg or diclofenac potassium mg on day followed by lornoxicam mg twice daily or diclofenac potassium mg twice daily for days
1446,efficacy outcomes included time to onset of pain relief as measured by the stopwatch method primary outcome pain intensity pain relief rescue medication ability to perform daily activities and global evaluation of the study medication
1447,the time to onset of pain relief ratios between diclofenac potassium lornoxicam was ci and ci in the intention to treat itt and per protocol pp analyses respectively demonstrating the non inferiority of lornoxicam defined by lower limits of the cis
1448,time to onset of pain relief was shorter with lornoxicam minutes compared with diclofenac potassium minutes
1449,the difference was not statistically significant itt analysis
1450,a higher magnitude of analgesic effect associated with better global evaluation of the study medication for lornoxicam was also demonstrated
1451,the drugs were equally well tolerated
1452,lornoxicam administered as a quick release formulation was shown to be non inferior to the equivalent formulation of diclofenac potassium in terms of onset of pain relief and more effective on most of the major standard efficacy outcomes
1453,migraine attacks are often treated with simple analgesics or with ergotamine containing preparations alone or in combination with anti emetics
1454,although also sometimes used to treat migraine nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids have not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials particularly in comparison with the newer drug sumatriptan
1455,sumatriptan is a specific migraine treatment which has recently become among the most widely prescribed acute migraine therapies
1456,however while effective it has low oral bioavailability and some problematic adverse effects
1457,diclofenac potassium is a potent nsaid available as a fast acting oral tablet which has been shown to be safe and effective in several other acute pain indications
1458,in the clinical trial reported here the efficacy and safety of diclofenac potassium in the acute treatment of migraine attacks has been tested in comparison with oral sumatriptan and placebo
1459,single oral doses of mg and mg diclofenac potassium were compared to a single oral dose of mg sumatriptan and placebo in a double blind randomized crossover trial in adult patients suffering from migraine attacks with or without aura selected according to the international headache society diagnostic criteria
1460,the primary efficacy criterion was migraine headache pain recorded on a visual analog scale at h after dosing
1461,secondary endpoints included pain at other time points up to h and the presence of accompanying symptoms nausea vomiting photophobia phonophobia
1462,diclofenac potassium was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine headache pain at h after dosing which was the primary endpoint
1463,secondary analyses showed that diclofenac potassium provided significant pain relief from min after dosing and for all remaining endpoints in the h observation period
1464,both and mg doses of diclofenac potassium were similarly effective
1465,a similar effect was shown with sumatriptan however significant superiority to placebo was seen only from the min time point
1466,diclofenac potassium was generally superior to placebo or sumatriptan in reducing accompanying symptoms particularly nausea
1467,diclofenac potassium seemed to be as well tolerated as placebo with fewer adverse events reported than after sumatriptan treatment and with more patients assessing the overall tolerability of diclofenac potassium better than that of sumatriptan
1468,compared with placebo and the reference therapy sumatriptan diclofenac potassium is an effective fast acting and well tolerated acute oral therapy for migraine attacks with advantages over oral sumatriptan in terms of onset of analgesic effect reduction of accompanying symptoms and tolerability profile
1469,it may therefore be useful as an alternative oral therapy for migraine attacks
1470,we assessed the efficacy of diclofenac potassium a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug in alleviating menstrual pain and restoring exercise performance to that measured in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle
1471,twelve healthy young women with a history of primary dysmenorrhea completed in a random order laboratory exercise testing sessions when they were in the late follicular no menstruation no pain phase of the menstrual cycle and when they were experiencing dysmenorrhea and receiving in a double blinded fashion either mg of diclofenac potassium or placebo
1472,we assessed the women s leg strength repetition maximum test aerobic capacity treadmill walking test and ability to perform a functional test task specific test
1473,compared with placebo diclofenac potassium significantly decreased dysmenorrhea on the day of administration visual analog scale p at all times
1474,when receiving placebo for menstrual pain the women s performance in the tests was decreased significantly compared with when they were receiving diclofenac potassium for menstrual pain p and compared with when they were in the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle p for treadmill test p for task specific test and repetition maximum test
1475,administration of diclofenac potassium for menstrual pain restored exercise performance to a level not different from that achieved in the late follicular phase of the cycle
1476,in women with primary dysmenorrhea menstrual pain if untreated decreases laboratory assessed exercise performance
1477,a recommended daily dose of a readily available nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac potassium is effective in relieving menstrual pain and restoring physical performance to levels achieved when the women were in the late follicular no menstruation no pain phase of the menstrual cycle
1478,in teeth with irreversible pulpitis successful local anesthesia is hard to achieve irrespective of the amount of local anesthesia and technique used
1479,such cases can be managed by concoction of pre medications like anxiolytics analgesics and effective local anesthesia
1480,this double blind placebo controlled study was planned to evaluate the effect of oral administration of alprazolam and diclofenac potassium on the success rate of inferior alveolar nerve block ianb gow gates gg and vazirani akinosi va techniques for the root canal treatment of mandibular molars with irreversible pulpitis
1481,emergency patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis were randomly divided into three groups as a b and c receiving ianb gg or v a respectively using lidocaine with epinephrine
1482,these groups were sub divided into sub groups i and ii as control and pre medication groups
1483,patients who did not react to the stimulus made by an explorer between the canine and first premolar and showing subjective lip and tongue numbness were included in the study
1484,all sub groups showed statistically significant reduction in vas score
1485,however sub groups v and vi that is gg with and without pre medication respectively showed best improvement in initial severe pain in mandibular molars with irreversible pulpitis
1486,moreover all pre medication sub groups showed better pain control compared to respective control groups
1487,it was concluded that use of pre medications in the form of combination of anxiolytics and analgesics improves the success rate of local anesthesia in teeth with irreversible pulpitis
1488,use of anxiolytics eases the patient in endodontic emergencies
1489,also use of gg along with pre medication is the best method for effective pain management of acute pain in irreversible pulpitis
1490,this paper reports the results of a pharmacokinetic study involving healthy volunteers and designed to characterise the rate and extent of diclofenac absorption after the administration of a single dose of diclofenac cas potassium salt mg in sachet voltfast and tablet cataflam formulations
1491,timed plasma concentrations of diclofenac during a h period after dosing were measured by means of hplc with uv detection at nm and a quantification limit of ng ml the method was fully validated for pharmacokinetic purposes
1492,these plasma concentrations were used to calculate cmax tmax trapezoidal auc t and auc infinity and t by means of noncompartmental analysis
1493,cmax and tmax are the parameters expressing the rate of absorption whereas the aucs reflect the extent of absorption
1494,the rate of absorption with the sachets proved to be very fast reaching peak values at min in seven subjects and at min in the remaining subjects mean time was min with concentrations at min being of cmax
1495,the average time to peak concentration with the tablets was min
1496,the extent of absorption of the sachets and tablets was similar with auc infinity values of respectively and ng ml h and a confidence interval the highly soluble potassium salt of diclofenac was rapidly absorbed especially in its sachet formulation and thus appears to be an invaluable analgesic agent that is particularly useful for quick pain relief
1497,in a double blind placebo controlled comparative study in patients with ankle sprains suffering from moderate to severe inflammation and tenderness the efficacy and tolerability of mg day diclofenac potassium given for days was superior to that of g day ibuprofen which was in turn superior to placebo
1498,efficacy was assessed by volumetric evaluation of inflammation of the injured ankle tenderness on finger pressure pain on movement and the severity of the joint injury
1499,patients used visual analogue scales to assess severity of pain at rest and on walking before and during treatment
1500,diclofenac potassium was significantly superior p less than to ibuprofen for all measures of efficacy except severity of joint injury and ibuprofen was consistently superior to placebo
1501,no serious adverse effects were reported
1502,in conclusion diclofenac potassium has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of acute ankle sprains and it had a rapid onset of action and good tolerability
1503,sodium and potassium diclofenac salts form hydrates when crystallized from water the sodium salt contains four crystallization water molecules while the potassium salt precipitates as a dihydrate
1504,crystallization from organic solvents occurs with a change of the crystal habit
1505,the fractal dimension of the particle surface of both salts obtained from water is low and is in agreement with the formation of smooth and regular surfaces during crystallization
1506,the fractal dimension for dissolution is relatively high and comparable for hydrate and anhydrate forms of both salts and the result was interpreted as being due to the surfactant behavior of diclofenac anions
1507,thermograms of both salts show a couple of endotherms in the range degrees c which disappear when the salts have been previously heated at degrees c but slowly reappear when the anhydrate forms are stored in a humid environment
1508,both salts present a complex exotherm of decomposition at and degrees c respectively
1509,the results are briefly discussed with regard to the formulations of the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac
1510,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs inhibit platelet aggregation and increase bleeding time however they are required to control pain and swelling following dental surgery
1511,the objective of this study was to evaluate possible changes on blood coagulation tests by using ketoprofen and diclofenac potassium after removal of mandibular third molars
1512,fifty one subjects between and years old with no history of gastrointestinal disorders or allergy to anti inflammatory components were randomly assigned to groups patients received mg of ketoprofen and patients received mg of diclofenac potassium
1513,subjects started the oral medication hours before surgery and continued taking it every hours for days
1514,blood samples were collected preoperatively and on the final day of the drug regime to evaluate prothrombin time activated partial thromboplastin time clot retraction and platelet count
1515,student t test for matched pairs did not show a significant difference between pre and posttreatment variables for both anti inflammatory drugs
1516,these results suggest that the safety of ketoprofen and diclofenac potassium is comparable to their anticoagulation effect
1517,a fully automated alkaline induced salting out homogeneous liquid liquid extraction ai shlle procedure coupled with in line organic phase detection by an optical probe has been suggested
1518,diclofenac was used as a proof of concept analyte
1519,the method is based on the oxidation of diclofenac with potassium ferricyanide in an alkaline medium followed by separation of the acetonitrile phase from the homogeneous sample solution and simultaneous extraction of the derivative
1520,sodium hydroxide serves as both the alkaline agent for the derivatization of diclofenac and as the salting out agent for the acetonitrile rich phase formation
1521,absorbance of the derivative in the acetonitrile rich phase was measured in line using an optical probe
1522,the calibration graph was linear over the range of moll
1523,novel formulations and administration routes of established drugs may result in higher maximum concentrations or total exposures and potentially cause previously unrecognized adverse events
1524,this study evaluated the proarrhythmic potential of hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd diclofenac a novel injectable diclofenac formulation solubilized with hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd on ventricular electrical conduction in preclinical and clinical models
1525,we assessed the effects of diclofenac hp cd and hp cd diclofenac on the human delayed rectifier potassium channel ikr using human embryonic kidney hek cells transfected with a human ether go go related gene herg using whole cell patch clamp
1526,in a single dose active and placebo controlled period crossover thorough qt in vivo study healthy volunteers mean age years range years male received hp cd diclofenac at and mg doses inactive vehicle placebo and an active control moxifloxacin
1527,in vitro diclofenac produced no statistically significant effect on ikr
1528,significant non dose dependent effects were observed in the presence of hp cd or hp cd diclofenac of similar magnitude across the fold dose range of concentrations tested suggesting an artifact due to the detergent effect of hp cd in this in vitro model
1529,in vivo neither hp cd diclofenac dose resulted in qtc prolongation ms ms is the threshold of clinical concern
1530,no correlation was evident between changes in qtc and plasma concentrations of diclofenac or hp cd
1531,confirming study sensitivity moxifloxacin produced a mean qtc prolongation ms
1532,the findings from the present study suggest that hp cd diclofenac does not have a dose dependent effect in the in vitro herg assay system and does not produce proarrhythmic qtc prolongation in vivo
1533,clinicaltrials gov identifier nct
1534,the voltage dependent m type potassium current m current plays a major role in controlling brain excitability by stabilizing the membrane potential and acting as a brake for neuronal firing
1535,the kcnq q heteromeric channel complex was identified as the molecular correlate of the m current
1536,furthermore the kcnq and kcnq channel alpha subunits are mutated in families with benign familial neonatal convulsions a neonatal form of epilepsy
1537,enhancement of kcnq q potassium currents may provide an important target for antiepileptic drug development
1538,here we show that meclofenamic acid meclofenamate and diclofenac two related molecules previously used as anti inflammatory drugs act as novel kcnq q channel openers
1539,extracellular application of meclofenamate ec microm and diclofenac ec microm resulted in the activation of kcnq q k currents heterologously expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells
1540,both openers activated kcnq q channels by causing a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage activation curve and mv respectively and by markedly slowing the deactivation kinetics
1541,the effects of the drugs were stronger on kcnq than on kcnq channel alpha subunits
1542,in contrast they did not enhance kcnq k currents
1543,both openers increased kcnq q current amplitude at physiologically relevant potentials and led to hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential
1544,in cultured cortical neurons meclofenamate and diclofenac enhanced the m current and reduced evoked and spontaneous action potentials whereas in vivo diclofenac exhibited an anticonvulsant activity ed mg kg
1545,these compounds potentially constitute novel drug templates for the treatment of neuronal hyperexcitability including epilepsy migraine or neuropathic pain
1546,in a double blind between patient study the efficacy of diclofenac potassium a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug was assessed in patients with mild to severe sprained ankles patients with more severe sports injuries were excluded
1547,patients were randomly allocated to receive mg diclofenac potassium three times daily mg day piroxicam or placebo for days
1548,diclofenac potassium was more effective than piroxicam or placebo in reducing pain at rest and on walking but did not significantly reduce the degree of swelling when measured volumetrically by water displacement
1549,no serious side effects were reported
1550,it is concluded that diclofenac potassium is useful in the treatment of moderately inflammatory processes with the advantage that it had a rapid onset of action with good overall tolerability
1551,to determine whether baseline nausea or prior triptan treatment for migraine impact the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution in treating acute migraine
1552,a great deal of variability exists in patients response to migraine medications
1553,migraine associated nausea is common and debilitating and can reduce the effectiveness of oral medications
1554,it may cause patients to delay taking oral medications which is known to diminish therapeutic outcomes or to avoid taking them altogether
1555,gastroparesis which may be associated with nausea also inhibits drug absorption resulting in lower bioavailability
1556,studies have shown that having nausea at the time of drug administration predicts a poorer response to triptan treatment
1557,it is of interest to understand how effective other migraine medications are in patients with a poor response to triptans
1558,data from two randomized double blind placebo controlled trials were pooled and post hoc subgroup analyses were performed in patients with and without nausea at baseline and in patients with and without prior triptan treatment
1559,efficacy assessments included the percentage of patients who at hours postdosing were headache pain free hpf primary endpoint without photophobia without phonophobia without nausea or without a severe degree of disability
1560,a cochran mantel haenszel test stratified by analysis center was used to evaluate treatment effect
1561,effects of nausea or prior triptan use were determined using logistic regression with factors of treatment group analysis center nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing and interaction of treatment group by nausea or prior triptan use at time of dosing
1562,the modified intent to treat population consisted of patients on active drug and on placebo
1563,the majority of patients were female
1564,at the time of dosing patients reported nausea with the treated attack
1565,prior triptan use was recorded in
1566,for headache pain nausea photophobia and phonophobia patients in the active treatment group had a statistically significantly better response than those receiving placebo regardless of whether they had nausea at baseline
1567,in logistic regression analysis only treatment group predicted a response for these parameters with no detectable group interaction
1568,baseline nausea as well as treatment group predicted whether patients recorded severe disability at hours
1569,while patients in the active treatment group were significantly more likely to be headache pain free at hours after dosing whether or not they had previously been treated with triptan more triptan na ve patients than triptan experienced patients were headache pain free
1570,interestingly in the placebo groups triptan na ve patients were also more likely to be pf vs
1571,in the logistic regression analysis treatment group predicted a headache pain response triptan use predicted a lack of response and there was no interaction between the two
1572,prior triptan use did not predict any of the other outcome measures
1573,nausea at the time of dosing does not diminish the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium for oral solution
1574,the rapid absorption profile may enhance the effectiveness in patients with nausea
1575,prior triptan use predicted poorer headache response at hours postdose suggesting the possibility of a subset of patients who are more likely to be refractory to both triptans and diclofenac
1576,diclofenac potassium for oral solution is effective in triptan na ve patients but no reliable inference can be made from this study as to about how to order treatment
1577,to compare the efficacy of oral diclofenac potassium versus hyoscine n butyl bromide hbb in reducing pain perception in patients undergoing diagnostic office hysteroscopy oh
1578,a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial canadian task force classification i
1579,a university hospital
1580,one hundred twenty nine patients were divided randomly into groups n in each group group received mg diclofenac potassium group received mg hbb and group received placebo tablets
1581,all tablets were taken orally hour before oh
1582,the primary outcome was the participant s self rated pain perception using the point visual analog scale during the procedure
1583,the secondary outcomes included the visual analog scale score minutes after oh ease of oh assessment using a cm scale duration of oh and adverse effects of the study medications
1584,both the diclofenac and hbb groups showed significant pain score reduction compared with the placebo group p
1585,the mean pain score in the diclofenac group was significantly lower than the hbb group vs respectively p
1586,the pain scores in the diclofenac and hbb groups immediately after oh were significantly lower than the placebo group p and the mean pain score in the diclofenac group was significantly lower than the hbb group vs respectively p
1587,the ease of procedure score was significantly lower in the diclofenac and hbb groups than the placebo group p and p respectively
1588,the mean duration of the procedure was significantly less in the diclofenac group p
1589,fourteen women in the hbb group experienced dizziness and women had nausea whereas only women in the diclofenac group had dizziness and women had vomiting
1590,oral diclofenac potassium administration hour before diagnostic oh reduces the procedure pain with subsequent easier and shorter oh duration
1591,oral hbb is less effective than diclofenac potassium with more adverse effects
1592,outpatient postoperative haemorrhoidectomy pain remains a difficult problem
1593,the purpose of this study is to compare the results of the use of betamethasone with diclofenac potassium in postoperative pain following haemorrhoidectomy
1594,closed haemorrhoidectomy was performed on patients who were diagnosed grade iii grade iv haemorrhoid on physical examination
1595,patients were divided equally randomized into two groups prospectively betamethasone was used for patients and diclofenac potassium was given for patients
1596,a verbal categorical scale was used to evaluate postoperative pain for pain intensity none mild moderate and severe
1597,the amount of narcotics required on postoperative first second and third day were significantly less in the betamethasone group than in the diclofenac potassium group p pearson chi square test
1598,results indicate that use of betamethasone provides more effective analgesia than diclofenac potassium for postoperative pain management in the haemorrhoidectomy patient
1599,in this study the electro oxidation capacities of naso and potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes were tested and compared for destruction of the sulfamethoxazole smx and diclofenac dcf on platinum pt electrode and graphite carbon electrode in aqueous medium
1600,the suitability of pharmaceutical active compounds phacs for electrochemical oxidation was tested by cyclic voltammetry cv technique performed in the potential range to v versus ag agcl which confirmed the electro activity of the selected phacs
1601,the degradation and mineralization were monitored by ultraviolet uv vis spectrophotometry and hplc
1602,m naso supporting electrolyte was found to be more effective for mineralization of smx and dcf with efficiency of more than the m phosphate buffer supporting electrolyte on the platinum pt and carbon electrodes
1603,the pt electrode showed better performance in the degradation of the two phacs while under the same conditions than the carbon electrode for both m naso and m potassium phosphate buffer supporting electrolytes
1604,the smx and dcf degradation kinetics best fitted the second order reaction with rate constants ranging between and mol l min and correlation coefficient r above the second order degradation kinetics indicated that the rate determining step in the degradation could be a chemical process thus suggesting the active involvement of electrolyte radical species in the degradation of smx and dcf
1605,results obtained from a real field sample showed a more than removal of the phacs from the wastewater by electrochemical degradation
1606,a complex of low molecular weight chitosan lmwc with oleic acid and diclofenac potassium dp was prepared and dispersed in high concentrations of polysorbate and in water to form a solution which releases its components slowly
1607,the formed complex was characterized using different analytical methods
1608,the size of the resulted nanoparticles and the effect of tweens on size were followed using dynamic light scattering dls
1609,the release of dp from this delivery system was monitored by altering the molecular weight of chitosan and the type and concentration of the polysorbates used
1610,the most suitable preparation consisted of dp lmwc kda and oleic acid
1611,this was dispersed in tween and the release was followed by the adaptation of usp ii apparatus using a cellophane bag
1612,this preparation offers a release of up to h
1613,this study was conducted with the aim to determine the pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence of diclofenac potassium mg test f tablet formulation with reference product caflam
1614,present study was single dose randomized two phase cross over design conducted in healthy pakistani volunteers and planned in accordance with fda guidelines
1615,in this study a simple selective sensitive and reproducible hplc procedure was developed and validated for the estimation of diclofenac potassium in plasma
1616,the process was validated in the range of g ml and used in bioequivalence trial of two products
1617,multiple blood samples were collected at various time points and hr after treating volunteers with test f and marketed reference brand
1618,plasma separation and deproteination were carried out with acetonitrile samples l were injected using the validated hplc method
1619,various pharmacokinetic parameters compartmental and noncompartmental were estimated using kineticatm thermo electron corp usa
1620,bioequivalence among the products was established by calculating the ci with log and non log transformed data for cmaxcalc tmaxcalc auc auctot and auclast using two way anova and schirmann s two one sided t test
1621,no significant difference was found between log and non log data
1622,the confidence interval values using log transformed data for auc auctot auclast cmaxcalc and tmaxcalc for the trial and reference products were found within the fda acceptable limits of results were further verified by the schirmann s one sided t test
1623,results showed the bioequivalence of test and reference formulations
1624,both the products were well tolerated
1625,the presence of an ionized carboxyl group in the widely used non steroidal anti inflammatory nsaid drug diclofenac potassium results in a high mobility of diclofenac and in its low sorption under conditions of slow sand filtration or subsoil passage
1626,no diclofenac degradation was detected in pure water or sludge during one month
1627,tertiary treatments of wastewater indicated that the effective removal of diclofenac was by reverse osmosis but the removal by activated carbon was less satisfactory
1628,this study presents an efficient method for the removal of diclofenac from water by micelle clay composites that are positively charged have a large surface area and include large hydrophobic domains
1629,adsorption of diclofenac in dispersion by charcoal and a composite micelle otadecyltrimethylammonium odtma and clay montmorillonite was investigated
1630,analysis by the langmuir isotherm revealed that charcoal had a somewhat larger number of adsorption sites than the composite but the latter had a significantly larger binding affinity for diclofenac
1631,filtration experiments on a solution containing ppm diclofenac demonstrated poor removal by activated carbon in contrast to very efficient removal by micelle clay filters
1632,in the latter case the weight of removed diclofenac exceeded half that of odtma in the filter
1633,filtration of diclofenac solutions at concentrations of and ppb yielded almost complete removal at flow rates of and ml min
1634,one kilogram of odtma in the micelle clay filter has been estimated to remove more than of diclofenac from a solution of ppb during passage of more than m
1635,this study compared the pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of low dose and mg diclofenac capsules manufactured using solumatrix fine particle technology trademark of iceutica inc philadelphia pennsylvania and the technology is licensed to iroko pharmaceuticals llc philadelphia pennsylvania for exclusive use in nsaids which produces submicron sized drug particles with enhanced dissolution properties to those of diclofenac potassium immediate release ir mg tablets
1636,this phase single center randomized open label single dose crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers
1637,subjects received in randomized order solumatrix diclofenac or mg capsules in the fasting condition solumatrix diclofenac mg capsules under fed conditions and diclofenac potassium ir mg tablets under fasting and fed conditions
1638,pharmacokinetic parameters t max c max auc t auc were calculated from the concentrations of diclofenac in the plasma
1639,absorption food effect and dose proportionality were determined using a mixed model anova for c max auc t auc
1640,tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events physical examination findings vital sign measurements clinical laboratory test results
1641,overall healthy volunteers aged to years completed the study
1642,the mean age of the subjects was years and approximately half were men
1643,median t max values were similar between the low dose solumatrix diclofenac mg capsules and the diclofenac potassium ir mg tablets both hour
1644,the mean maximum plasma concentration c max after the administration of low dose solumatrix diclofenac mg capsules was lower than that with diclofenac potassium ir mg tablets under fasting conditions vs ng ml
1645,the administration of low dose solumatrix diclofenac mg capsules was associated with a lower overall systemic exposure compared with that of diclofenac potassium ir mg tablets under fasting conditions
1646,food decreased the rate but not the overall extent of absorption of solumatrix diclofenac
1647,no serious aes and no clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination findings including vital sign measurements or clinical laboratory test results were noted during this study
1648,the pharmacokinetic properties of low dose solumatrix diclofenac capsules in the healthy volunteers in this study suggest rapid diclofenac absorption as measured by t max
1649,low dose solumatrix diclofenac capsules represent a potential option for the management of acute and osteoarthritis related pain
1650,primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder that disrupts daytime functioning and nighttime sleep quality
1651,we determined the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium compared to placebo in alleviating nighttime pain and restoring sleep architecture in women with primary dysmenorrhea
1652,randomized double blind crossover study
1653,sleep laboratory
1654,ten healthy women years with a history of primary dysmenorrhea
1655,placebo or diclofenac potassium mg per day for menstrual pain
1656,we assessed objective measures of sleep polysomnography and subjective measures of sleep quality mood and intensity of menstrual pain
1657,compared to a pain free phase of the menstrual cycle mid follicular women receiving placebo for their menstrual pain had a poorer mood p decreased sleep efficiency p less rem sleep p more stage sleep p and more sleep stage changes per hour of sleep during the night
1658,administration of diclofenac potassium compared to placebo not only attenuated the women s menstrual pain p but also increased sleep efficiency p and percentage of rem sleep p decreased percentage of stage sleep p and number of sleep stage changes per hour of sleep p and improved subjective ratings of sleep quality and morning vigilance p
1659,diclofenac potassium effectively attenuates nighttime dysmenorrheic pain and restores subjective and objective measures of sleep quality to values recorded in a pain free phase of the menstrual cycle
1660,the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are among the most widely used drugs in the control of postoperative pain
1661,in choosing the nsaid to be used it is essential to assess the most favorable risk benefit ratio according to a careful assessment of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors and cardiovascular gastrointestinal renal and metabolic patient comorbidities
1662,diclofenac dose of mg die is the nsaid that has wider literature that attests its efficacy and tolerability
1663,due to its high lipid solubility it is one of the few nsaids that are able to cross the blood brain barrier with an action principally directed towards cox
1664,over time several studies have been conducted to evaluate the side effects of nsaids
1665,regarding diclofenac s cardiovascular and gastrointestinal tolerability recent studies indicate that the relative risk and absolute risk of complications of diclofenac are similar to coxib and inferior to other nsaids
1666,important feature of diclofenac is that unlike other nsaids it does not interfere with the cardio protective effect of acetyl salicylic acid
1667,diclofenac potassium is instead indicated for use as an analgesic in headache and as an antipyretic in influenza like symptoms
1668,studies with the aim of investigating the intestinal damage exacerbated by proton pump inhibitors drugs when associated with nsaids state that at least in part they aggravate the intestinal damage induced by nsaids due to significant changes in intestinal microbial populations
1669,the reference dose of diclofenac used in all randomized controlled trials is mg die this controlled release dosage allows to decrease the number of daily administrations ensuring a better patient compliance especially if elderly and or in polytherapy
1670,patients who experience pain swelling and trismus after third molar extraction are reported to experience a fold higher rate of adverse effects aes on quality of life compared with those who are asymptomatic after this surgery
1671,therefore investigators emphasize the necessity for better control of this triad of sequelae
1672,steroids can reduce the risk for physiologic processes of inflammation thereby suppressing the development of inflammation
1673,the aim of this study was to compare the effects of dexamethasone mg im and diclofenac potassium k mg po dexamethasone mg im and acetaminophen mg po and monotherapy with diclofenac k mg po on postoperative pain swelling and trismus after surgical removal of third molars
1674,this prospective randomized open label pilot study was conducted at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery lagos university teaching hospital lagos nigeria
1675,patients were randomly allocated to of treatment groups concomitant treatment with dexamethasone mg im and diclofenac k mg po or acetaminophen mg po or monotherapy with diclofenac k mg po
1676,overall analgesic efficacy of the drug combinations was assessed for days postoperatively using a point categorical pain intensity rating scale no pain mild pain moderate pain and severe pain
1677,facial swelling was measured in dimension on days and after surgery using a tape measure placed from the tip of the tragus to gonion to the tip of the contralateral tragus and trismus was assessed using interincisal mouth opening ability measured using a vernier calibrated caliper on postoperative days and tolerability was assessed using direct questioning of the patients at follow up visits
1678,a total of patients per treatment group were included in the analysis women men mean sd age years range years nigerian
1679,the proportion of patients reporting no pain on the pain intensity rating scale was significantly higher in the group receiving dexamethasone and diclofenac k compared with that in the groups receiving dexamethasone and acetaminophen or diclofenac k monotherapy vs and respectively both p
1680,facial swelling was significantly less with dexamethasone and diclofenac k or dexamethasone and acetaminophen compared with diclofenac k alone day p and p respectively day p and p respectively
1681,however trismus relief was statistically similar between the treatment groups on postoperative days and no aes or complications were recorded
1682,in this open label pilot study concomitant treatment with dexamethasone and diclofenac k provided significant relief of postsurgical pain and swelling compared with dexamethasone and acetaminophen or monotherapy with diclofenac k after third molar extraction in these patients
1683,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc zipsor is a novel formulation of diclofenac potassium used to treat mild to moderate acute pain
1684,to investigate whether dpsgc mg provided significant reduction in pain intensity compared with placebo regardless of baseline pain intensity a post hoc analysis was performed of pooled data from two replicate randomized controlled trials nct and nct that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dpsgc in postbunionectomy treatment
1685,patients from the two randomized trials were assigned to one of two subgroups patients with baseline numerical pain rating scale nprs scores of or greater to less than and those with baseline nprs scores of or greater
1686,within each subgroup efficacy and safety of dpsgc was compared with placebo
1687,across the two studies dpsgc and placebo treated patients had baseline pain intensity scores ranging from or greater to less than while dpsgc and placebo treated patients had baseline pain intensity scores of or greater
1688,significantly lower mean hour nprs scores were observed in the dpsgc group regardless of baseline pain intensity p
1689,in both subgroups at least twice as many patients treated with dpsgc rated the study drug as very good or excellent compared with patients taking placebo
1690,potential limitations for this post hoc analysis include study design and patient population
1691,as with all studies investigating treatment for pain the use of rescue medication may also be a potential limitation
1692,dpsgc provided significantly greater improvements in pain compared with placebo following bunionectomy regardless of patients baseline pain level
1693,this double blind randomised parallel group trial compared the analgesic efficacy of single mg doses of diclofenac potassium sachets and tablets with placebo in patients with moderate severe pain after third molar extraction
1694,the primary efficacy variable was the average pain reduction from baseline during the first h postdose using a visual analogue scale vas
1695,during the first h postdose sachets and tablets significantly reduced pain p vs placebo with an incremental benefit seen for sachets over tablets p
1696,onset of analgesic effect vas was at min for sachets and min for tablets
1697,pain reduction vs placebo vas was maintained for h for sachets and tablets p
1698,vas findings were confirmed by pain relief and intensity verbal scale assessments
1699,fewer patients re medicated vs placebo
1700,no safety issues were identified
1701,this study demonstrates that both diclofenac potassium sachets and tablets offer patients suffering from acute pain conditions an effective treatment with incremental analgesic benefits seen for sachets
1702,a randomized controlled cross over trial compared single doses of mg diclofenac potassium sachets and tablets with placebo in patients with migraine pain treating attacks
1703,for the primary endpoint of the patients were pain free at h postdose with sachets for tablets and for placebo
1704,treatment differences were significant for sachets vs placebo p tablets vs placebo p and for sachets vs tablets p
1705,the numbers needed to treat compared with placebo to achieve pain free at h were confidence interval ci for sachets and ci for tablets
1706,sachets were also statistically superior to tablets for sustained headache response sustained pain free and reduction in headache intensity within the first h postdose measured on a visual analogue scale p
1707,onset of analgesic effect was min for sachets and min for tablets
1708,fewer patients needed rescue medication and there were marked improvements in accompanying symptoms and working ability with both sachets and tablets vs placebo
1709,no safety issues were identified
1710,this study demonstrates that sachets offer patients suffering from migraine pain a more effective treatment with a faster onset of analgesia when compared with tablets
1711,the beneficial effects of kolaviron a natural biflavonoid from the seeds of garcinia kola have been attributed to its antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities
1712,this study was designed to investigate the renoprotective effect of kolaviron in rat model of diclofenac dfc induced acute renal failure
1713,thirty five male wistar rats were divided into groups of rats each as follows a control group that received propylene glycol orally and treatment groups that received dfc dfc recovery dfc followed by kolaviron at different doses and kolaviron only
1714,dfc treated rats showed sluggishness illness and anorexia
1715,their urine contained appreciable protein glucose and ketone bodies
1716,histopathological examination of their kidneys revealed profound acute tubular necrosis
1717,dfc treatment significantly increased levels of plasma creatinine urea sodium chloride potassium ions and increased renal tissue activities of superoxide dismutase catalase levels of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide
1718,fractional excretion of sodium and potassium and renal tissue levels of reduced glutathione and prostaglandin e
1719,in this study the simultaneous determination of diclofenac potassium dp and methocarbamol mt by chemometric approaches and artificial neural networks using uv spectrophotometry has been reported as a simple alternative to using separate models for each component
1720,three chemometric techniques classical least squares cls principal component regression pcr and partial least squares pls along with radial basis function artificial neural network rbf ann were prepared by using the synthetic mixtures containing the two drugs in methanol
1721,a set of synthetic mixtures of dp and mt was evaluated and the results obtained by the application of these methods were discussed and compared
1722,in cls pcr and pls the absorbance data matrix corresponding to the concentration data matrix was obtained by the measurements of absorbances in the range nm in the intervals with nm in their zero order spectra
1723,then calibration or regression was obtained by using the absorbance data matrix and concentration data matrix for the prediction of the unknown concentrations of dp and mt in their mixtures
1724,in rbf ann the input layer consisting of neurons neurons in the hidden layer and output neurons were found appropriate for the simultaneous determination of dp and mt
1725,the accuracy and the precision of the four methods have been determined and they have been validated by analyzing synthetic mixtures containing the two drugs
1726,the proposed methods were successfully applied to a pharmaceutical formulation containing the examined drugs
1727,in present investigation new formulations of sodium alginate acrylic acid hydrogels with high porous structure were synthesized by free radical polymerization technique for the controlled drug delivery of analgesic agent to colon
1728,many structural parameters like molecular weight between crosslinks
1729,this study aimed to investigate the gastrointestinal supersaturation and precipitation behavior of a weakly acidic biopharmaceutics classification system bcs class ii drug in healthy volunteers
1730,for this purpose a tablet containing mg diclofenac potassium cataflam was predissolved in ml of water and this solution was subsequently orally administered to five healthy volunteers under fasted and fed state conditions with or without concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor ppi mg esomeprazole nexiam
1731,subsequently total diclofenac content and dissolved intraluminal drug concentrations as well as drug thermodynamic solubility were determined in gastrointestinal aspirates
1732,in all volunteers gastric supersaturation resulted in precipitation of diclofenac in the stomach
1733,the extent of precipitation correlated well with gastric ph r
1734,ph dependency of precipitation was corroborated by the absence of precipitate in the stomach after coadministration of a meal and or a ppi
1735,diclofenac was found to be fully dissolved in the duodenum in all test conditions
1736,it can be concluded that substantial ph dependent gastric precipitation of a weakly acidic bcs class ii drug administered as a solution occurs in humans
1737,with regard to its implications for intestinal absorption results suggest the instantaneous redissolution of gastric drug precipitate upon transfer to the duodenum
1738,to determine the effectiveness of diclofenac potassium combined with lidocaine gel in reducing the pain of intrauterine device iud insertion
1739,we randomized parous women requesting copper ta iud insertion in a ratio to active or placebo treatment
1740,active treatment included administration of two mg diclofenac potassium tablets h before iud insertion application of ml of lidocaine gel on the anterior cervical lip min before iud insertion and placement of a cotton swab soaked in lidocaine gel in the cervical canal min before iud insertion
1741,women in the placebo group received placebo tablets and gel
1742,participants assessed pain intensity using a cm visual analog scale vas
1743,we considered a cm difference in vas pain score between both groups during iud insertion to be a clinically significant difference
1744,subjects receiving active treatment as compared to placebo experienced less pain during tenaculum placement vs p and iud insertion vs p
1745,women who delivered only by cesarean section had higher pain scores with iud insertion compared with women with previous vaginal deliveries vs p
1746,diclofenac potassium combined with lidocaine gel slightly reduced pain scores during tenaculum application and copper iud insertion in parous women however the reduction in pain scores lacked clinical significance
1747,although we found a statistically significant lowering of pain scores with pretreatment with diclofenac potassium and lidocaine gel in parous women having copper iud placement the reduction is not clinically relevant
1748,these findings may be more relevant for nulliparous women who experience more pain than parous women with iud insertion and support studies of diclofenac potassium and lidocaine gel in this population
1749,diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug available as a potassium salt immediate release or sodium salt enteric coated to suppress dissolution in the stomach
1750,this review updates an earlier review published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews issue entitled single dose oral diclofenac for acute postoperative pain in adults
1751,to assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of diclofenac for moderate to severe postoperative pain using methods that permit comparison with other analgesics evaluated in standardised trials using almost identical methods and outcomes
1752,we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central medline embase the oxford pain relief database two clinical trial registries and the reference lists of articles
1753,the date of the most recent search was march
1754,randomised double blind placebo controlled clinical trials of single dose oral diclofenac sodium or potassium for acute postoperative pain in adults
1755,two review authors independently considered studies for inclusion in the review assessed risk of bias and extracted data
1756,we used the area under the pain relief versus time curve to derive the proportion of participants with at least pain relief over six hours prescribed either diclofenac or placebo
1757,we calculated the risk ratio rr and number needed to treat to benefit nnt
1758,we used information on the use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use
1759,we also collected information on adverse effects
1760,this update included three new studies providing a increase in participants in comparisons between diclofenac and placebo
1761,we included studies involving participants treated with diclofenac and with placebo
1762,this update has also changed the focus of the review examining the effects of formulation in more detail than previously
1763,this is a result of increased understanding of the importance of speed of onset in determining analgesic efficacy in acute pain the largest body of information for diclofenac potassium mg in seven studies produced an nnt for at least of maximum pain relief compared with placebo of confidence interval ci to high quality evidence
1764,there was a graded improvement in efficacy as doses rose from mg to mg both for participants achieving at least maximum pain relief and for remedication within to hours
1765,fast acting formulations dispersible products solutions and softgel formulations had a similar efficacy for a mg dose with an nnt of to
1766,diclofenac sodium in a small number of studies produced a lesser effect with an nnt of to for the mg dose adverse event rates were low in these single dose studies with no difference between diclofenac and placebo moderate quality evidence
1767,diclofenac potassium provides good pain relief at mg mg and mg doses
1768,diclofenac sodium has limited efficacy and should probably not be used in acute pain
1769,the effects of graded doses of aspirin acetylsalicylic acid and cataflam potassium diclofenac on serum aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase nucleotidase methaemoglobin total and conjaged bilirubin were investigated in wistar rats
1770,results showed a significant increase p in the levels of alanine animotransferase aspartate amino transferase methaemoglobin total and conjugated bilirubin upon treatment of animals with both drugs
1771,aspirin significantly decreased p p the activity of alkaline phsophatase but increased the activity of ucleotidase while cataflam significantly increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase p and nucletodase p
1772,these effects were however dose dependent and the biochemical implications of these results are discussed
1773,to compare the three non steroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaids diclofenac potassium etodolac and naproxen sodium in relation to pain swelling and trismus following impacted third molar surgery
1774,the study was a randomized and a double blinded study which included healthy young individuals with impacted third molars and bone retention
1775,patients were randomly assigned to groups n to which diclofenac potassium naproxen sodium and etodolac were administered orally an hour before the operation
1776,impacted third molars were surgically extracted with local anaesthesia
1777,visual analog scales vas were used to assess the pain in the th th hours and on the st nd rd th and th days postoperatively
1778,swelling was evaluated using ultrasound us and mouth opening trismus was measured with a composing stick pre and post operatively on the nd and th days respectively
1779,regarding pain alleviation diclofenac potassium was better than naproxen sodium and naproxen sodium was better than etodolac but these differences were not statistically significant
1780,us measurements showed that the swelling on postoperative nd day was significantly lowest with diclofenac potassium as compared to others p while naproxen sodium and etodolac acted similarly p
1781,no difference was noted regarding trismus in any of the groups
1782,nsaids diclofenac naproxen and etodolac are somehow similarly effective for controlling pain and trismus following extraction of mandibular third molars but diclofenac potassium surpasses others in reduction of swelling
1783,polacrilin potassium is an ion exchange resin used in oral pharmaceutical formulations as a tablet disintegrant
1784,it is a weakly acidic cation exchange resin
1785,chemically it is a partial potassium salt of a copolymer of methacrylic acid with divinyl benzene
1786,it ionizes to an anionic polymer chain and potassium cations
1787,it was hypothesized that polacrilin potassium may be able to improve the permeability of anionic drugs according to the donnan membrane phenomenon
1788,the effect of polacrilin potassium on the permeability of diclofenac potassium used as a model anionic drug was tested in vitro using diffusion cells and in vivo by monitoring serum levels in rats
1789,the amount of drug permeated across a dialysis membrane in vitro was significantly more in the presence of polacrilin potassium
1790,significant improvement was found in the extent of drug absorption in vivo
1791,it could be concluded that polacrilin potassium may be used as a high functionality excipient for improving the bioavailability of anionic drugs having poor gastrointestinal permeability
1792,this study investigated gastrointestinal drug concentrations of the weakly acidic drug diclofenac when dosed to healthy volunteers after intake of the fda standard meal
1793,in gastrointestinal aspiration studies postprandial conditions are usually achieved using liquid or homogenized meals
1794,however these liquid meals may have a substantially different impact on the gastrointestinal physiology compared to a solid meal
1795,to evaluate the effect of a solid meal on the gastrointestinal behavior of diclofenac five healthy volunteers were recruited into a clinical study
1796,twenty minutes prior to diclofenac ingestion cataflam mg of potassium diclofenac the volunteers were asked to eat a solid meal with the following composition corresponding to the fda standard meal eggs bacon strips toasts ounces of hash brown potatoes and ounces of milk
1797,gastric and duodenal fluids were collected as a function of time and blood samples were collected to link the gastrointestinal behavior to systemic exposure
1798,in vivo observations were complemented with in vitro research to obtain a mechanistic understanding of diclofenac s intraluminal behavior
1799,ingestion of the solid meal resulted in intraluminal ph profiles similar to earlier studies with a liquid meal
1800,however intraluminal drug disposition differed
1801,in the stomach a substantial fraction of diclofenac appeared dissolved despite an unfavorable acidic ph
1802,successive in vitro tests suggested that the dissolution of diclofenac is higher in the complex gastric medium resulting from fda standard meal ingestion compared to liquid meal ingestion
1803,despite the favorable ph and in contrast to a previous study with a liquid meal significant amounts of non dissolved diclofenac were observed in the intestine
1804,further in vitro tests revealed adsorption of dissolved diclofenac molecules to bacon fragments present in the fda standard meal
1805,this adsorption negatively affected the permeation of diclofenac across a physical barrier suggesting that in vivo absorption is affected as well
1806,being the first time a gastrointestinal aspiration study is combined with the administration of a solid meal the present study demonstrates that the intraluminal behavior of diclofenac and possibly other drugs heavily depends on the consistency and composition of the accompanied meal
1807,the purpose of the present study was to prepare matrix extended release pellets of diclofenac potassium using low amount of release modifying agents and to compare its performance in vivo with coated pellets and matrix tablets
1808,coated pellets were prepared by extrusion spheronization followed by double layer coating using different polymers separately
1809,matrix pellets with different release rate in vitro were prepared by extrusion spheronization with different kinds of retarding materials
1810,bioavailability study of different coated pellets revealed that the drug concentration in plasma of beagle dogs was too low to be detected and implied that the drug was nearly not released from the preparations before reaching colon due to the appearance of lag time in the dissolution process
1811,the phenomenon indicated that slow release pellets of diclofenac potassium perhaps should not be developed as double membrane controlled type
1812,the auc of the immediate release pellets the two matrix pellets and the reference were and g h ml respectively
1813,the c max of the formulations mentioned above were and g ml respectively
1814,all the matrix formulations including the reference exhibited incomplete absorption due to the short small intestine transit time and termination of the drug release in the colon because of its limited solubility
1815,the matrix pellets were bioequivalent with the commercially available tablet voltaren although the drug release in vitro of the former was much faster while the bioavailability of the matrix pellets with similar in vitro drug release to the reference voltaren was much lower than the latter
1816,the results perhaps was caused by lacking of physical robustness in the waxy tablet formulation resulted in low wet strength and easily destroyed by the mechanical destructive forces and finally introduced faster drug release rate in vivo
1817,it is apparent that preparations with similar performance in vitro may differ a lot in vivo because of the differences in drug release rate in vivo owing to various wet strengths of excipients contained especially for sustained release products
1818,there are many options for acute migraine attack treatment but none is ideal for all patients
1819,this study aims to review current medical office based acute migraine therapy in adults and provides readers with an organized approach to this important facet of migraine treatment
1820,a general literature review includes a review of several recent published guidelines
1821,acetaminophen nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen acetylsalicylic acid asa naproxen sodium and diclofenac potassium and triptans almotriptan eletriptan frovatriptan naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan and zolmitriptan have good evidence for efficacy and form the core of acute migraine treatment
1822,nsaid triptan combinations dihydroergotamine non opioid combination analgesics acetaminophen asa and caffeine and several anti emetics metoclopramide domperidone and prochlorperazine are additional evidence based options
1823,opioid containing combination analgesics may be helpful in specific patients but should not be used routinely
1824,clinical features to be considered when choosing an acute migraine medication include usual headache intensity usual rapidity of pain intensity increase nausea vomiting degree of disability patient response to previously used medications history of headache recurrence with previous attacks and the presence of contraindications to specific acute medications
1825,available acute medications can be organized into treatment strategies including a strategy for attacks of mild to moderate severity strategy one acetaminophen and or nsaids a triptan strategy for patients with severe attacks and for attacks not responding to strategy one a refractory attack strategy and a strategy for patients with contraindications to vasoconstricting drugs
1826,acute treatment of migraine attacks during pregnancy lactation and for patients with chronic migraine is also discussed
1827,in chronic migraine it is particularly important that medication overuse is eliminated or avoided
1828,migraine treatment is complex and treatment must be individualized and tailored to the patient s clinical features
1829,clinicians should make full use of available medications and formulations in an organized approach
1830,the rapid availability of the drug at the site of action followed by maintaining its effect for a long period of time is of great clinical importance
1831,thus the purpose of the present study was to prepare and evaluate multi layered matrix tablets of diclofenac using eudragit rl rs blend to achieve both immediate and sustained therapeutic effects
1832,diclofenac potassium mg was incorporated in an outer immediate release layer to provide immediate pain relief whereas diclofenac sodium mg was incorporated in the inner core to provide extended drug release
1833,wet granulation was employed to prepare the inner core of the tablets that were further layered with an immediate release drug layer in the perforated pan coater
1834,the in vitro and in vivo performance of the developed formulation was compared with the marketed products voltaren sr mg and cataflam mg the in vitro drug release of the prepared formulation showed similarity
1835,the interaction of diclofenac and ketoprofen both applied intraperitoneally in a dose of mg kg for twenty eight days was assessed with cardioactive drugs in rats
1836,interaction was assessed on the basis of ecg records after the infusion of adrenaline verapamil or lidocaine to the rats treated with diclofenac or ketoprofen vs control
1837,the infusion time was measured in seconds to the moment of the appearance of the first heart reaction to the infusion of the cardioactive drug then to the appearance of more frequent changes in the ecg record and finally to the occurrence of the toxic effect
1838,it was also measured the plasma concentrations of sodium and potassium ions
1839,as well as diclofenac and ketoprofen concentration hours after single and th dose
1840,ecg patterns revealed no occurrence of cardiotoxic action of diclofenac and ketoprofen
1841,the treatment with diclofenac caused significantly lower sodium plasma concentrations whereas the concentration of potassium was increased
1842,diclofenac concentrations were the same after a single and multiple doses whereas concentrations of ketoprofen were significantly higher after a single dose than after its multiple applications
1843,this article provides a systematic evidence based approach to acute medication choices for the patient with migraine
1844,recent clinical trials meta analyses and practice guidelines have confirmed that four nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids with randomized controlled trial evidence for efficacy in migraine ibuprofen naproxen sodium diclofenac potassium and acetylsalicylic acid and seven triptans sumatriptan rizatriptan eletriptan zolmitriptan almotriptan frovatriptan and naratriptan are appropriate medications for acute migraine treatment
1845,dihydroergotamine dhe is also suitable for selected patients
1846,nsaids and triptans are the mainstays of acute migraine therapy and antiemetic drugs can be added as necessary
1847,opioids and combination analgesics containing opioids should not be used routinely
1848,patient specific clinical features should help guide the selection of an acute medication for an individual patient
1849,acute medications can be organized into four treatment strategies for use in various clinical settings
1850,the acetaminophen nsaid strategy is suitable for patients with attacks of mild to moderate severity
1851,the triptan strategy is suitable for patients with severe attacks and for those with attacks of moderate severity who do not respond well to nsaids
1852,the refractory migraine strategies may be useful for patients who do not respond well to the nsaids or triptans alone and include using triptans and nsaids simultaneously in combination dhe and rescue medications eg dopamine antagonists combination analgesics and corticosteroids when the patient s usual medications fail
1853,strategies for patients with contraindications to vasoconstricting drugs include use of nsaids combination analgesics and dopamine antagonists acetaminophen is the safest acute migraine drug during pregnancy and acetaminophen with codeine is also an option
1854,sumatriptan may be an option during pregnancy for selected patients and is compatible with breast feeding
1855,this review is an update of a previously published review in issue derry a
1856,migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual health services and society
1857,many sufferers choose not to or are unable to seek professional help and rely on over the counter otc analgesics
1858,diclofenac is an established analgesic and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts which can be dissolved in water have been developed for rapid absorption which may be beneficial in acute migraine
1859,co therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine
1860,to determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac alone or in combination with an antiemetic compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults
1861,we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central medline embase the oxford pain relief database clinicaltrials gov and reference lists for studies through september for the original review and february for the update
1862,we included randomised double blind placebo controlled or active controlled studies or both using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode with at least participants per treatment arm
1863,two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data
1864,we used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk or risk ratio and numbers needed to treat to benefit nnt or harm nnh compared to placebo or a different active treatment
1865,five studies participants attacks compared oral diclofenac with placebo and one also compared it with sumatriptan none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic
1866,four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response
1867,only two studies with three active treatment arms provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes
1868,for single doses of diclofenac potassium mg versus placebo two studies the nnts were and for pain free at two hours headache relief at two hours and pain free responses at hours respectively similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events which were mostly mild and transient with diclofenac and placebo there were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator oral sumatriptan mg
1869,oral diclofenac potassium mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine providing relief from pain and associated symptoms although only a minority of patients experience pain free responses
1870,adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo
1871,a sensitive simple selective precise and accurate hptlc method of analysis for paracetamol diclofenac potassium and famotidine both as a bulk drug and in tablet formulation was developed and validated
1872,the method used hptlc aluminum plates precoated with silica gel f as the stationary phase and the mobile phase consisted of toluene acetone methanol formic acid v v v v
1873,densitometric evaluation of the separated zones was performed at nm
1874,this system was found to give compact spots for paracetamol rf value diclofenac potassium and famotidine
1875,the linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship over the concentration range of ng spot for paracetamol ng spot for diclofenac potassium and ng spot for famotidine
1876,the method was validated for precision robustness and recovery according to international conference on harmonization guidelines
1877,no chromatographic interference from the tablet excipients was found
1878,statistical analysis showed that the method was repeatable and selective for the simultaneous quantitation of the three drugs in tablet formulation and for routine quality control of raw materials of the drugs
1879,non prescription over the counter or otc analgesics painkillers are used frequently
1880,they are available in various brands package sizes formulations and dose
1881,they can be used for a range of different types of pain but this overview reports on how well they work for acute pain pain of short duration usually with rapid onset
1882,thirty nine cochrane reviews of randomised trials have examined the analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain
1883,to examine published cochrane reviews for information about the efficacy of pain medicines available without prescription using data from acute postoperative pain
1884,we identified otc analgesics available in the uk australia canada and the usa by examining online pharmacy websites
1885,we also included some analgesics diclofenac potassium dexketoprofen dipyrone of importance in parts of the world but not currently available in these jurisdictions we identified systematic reviews by searching the cochrane database of systematic reviews cdsr on the cochrane library through a simple search strategy
1886,all reviews were overseen by a single review group had a standard title and had as their primary outcome numbers of participants with at least pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo
1887,from individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome nnt for this outcome for each drug dose combination and also calculated the success rate to achieve at least of maximum pain relief
1888,we also examined the number of participants experiencing any adverse event and whether the incidence was different from placebo
1889,we found information on different otc analgesic drugs doses and formulations using information from cochrane reviews supplemented by information from one non cochrane review with additional information on ibuprofen formulations high quality evidence
1890,the lowest best nnt values were for combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol with nnt values below analgesics with values close to included fast acting formulations of ibuprofen mg and mg ibuprofen mg plus caffeine mg and diclofenac potassium mg combinations of ibuprofen plus paracetamol had success rates of almost with dipyrone mg fast acting ibuprofen formulations mg and mg ibuprofen mg plus caffeine mg and diclofenac potassium mg having success rates above
1891,paracetamol and aspirin at various doses had nnt values of or above and success rates of to
1892,we found no information on many of the commonly available low dose codeine combinations the proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event were generally not different from placebo except for aspirin mg and barely ibuprofen mg plus caffeine mg for ibuprofen plus paracetamol adverse event rates were lower than with placebo
1893,there is a body of reliable evidence about the efficacy of some of the most commonly available drugs and doses widely available without prescription
1894,the postoperative pain model is predominantly pain after third molar extraction which is used as the industry model for everyday pain
1895,the proportion of people with acute pain who get good pain relief with any of them ranges from around at best to less than at worst low doses of some drugs in fast acting formulations were among the best
1896,adverse events were generally no different from placebo
1897,consumers can make an informed choice based on this knowledge together with availability and price
1898,headache and migraine were not included in this overview
1899,the objective of the study was to formulate and evaluate controlled release polymeric tablets of diclofenac potassium for the release rate release patterns and the mechanism involved in the release process of the drug
1900,formulations with different types and grades of ethyl cellulose ether derivatives in several drug to polymer ratios d p were compressed into tablets using the direct compression method
1901,in vitro drug release studies were performed in phosphate buffer ph as dissolution medium by using usp method rotating basket method
1902,similarity factor f and dissimilarity factor f were applied for checking the similarities and dissimilarities of the release profiles of different formulations
1903,for the determination of the release mechanism and drug release kinetics various mathematical kinetic models were employed
1904,it was found that all of the ethocel polymers could significantly slow down the drug release rate with ethocel fp polymers being the most efficient especially at d p ratios of which lead towards the achievement of zero or near zero order release kinetics
1905,a fast release liquid capsule formulation of low dose diclofenac k is available which aims to improve patient convenience and compliance
1906,the new formulation is a soft gelatin capsule designed to facilitate faster absorption of diclofenac versus the tablet form with anticipated overall comparable bioavailability
1907,to compare the bioavailability of diclofenac k mg liquid capsules versus diclofenac k mg tablets
1908,this randomized open label crossover single dose study was conducted in healthy subjects mean age years given diclofenac k mg liquid capsules or tablets over two day treatment periods separated by a day washout period
1909,diclofenac k mg liquid capsules were equivalent to the tablets in terms of total systemic exposure mean auct ratio sided ci
1910,however the mean cmax for the liquid capsules ng ml was almost double that of the tablets ng ml mean cmax ratio sided ci
1911,median tmax was min faster with the liquid capsules h compared with the tablets h and auctmax ref for the liquid capsules ng h ml was almost double the value for the tablets ng h ml
1912,this indicated a faster absorption of diclofenac from the liquid capsules compared to the tablet
1913,there were no differences between the two treatments regarding safety and both drugs were well tolerated
1914,this study demonstrated equivalent overall systemic exposure to diclofenac but a faster absorption and substantially greater early exposure to diclofenac from diclofenac k liquid capsules compared with the tablets which may lead to a more rapid analgesic effect in patients
1915,to determine the optimum time of administration of diclofenac in patients undergoing ambulatory knee arthroscopy either preoperatively or postoperatively
1916,randomized double blind study
1917,ambulatory surgical unit in a tertiary referral hospital
1918,asa physical status i and ii patients undergoing ambulatory knee arthroscopy
1919,patients were randomized into three groups
1920,the preop group received mg of potassium diclofenac orally hour preoperatively and a placebo minutes postoperatively
1921,the pre postop group received mg of potassium diclofenac hour preoperatively and mg diclofenac minutes postoperatively
1922,the postop group received a placebo hour before surgery and mg of potassium diclofenac minutes postoperatively
1923,the postop group received a placebo hour preoperatively and mg of potassium diclofenac min postoperatively
1924,postoperatively patients used intravenous patient controlled analgesia pca with fentanyl
1925,total fentanyl consumption was recorded
1926,during the recovery period pain was assessed using a visual analog scale vas at minute intervals
1927,pain was assessed in both legs at rest on flexion and extension of the knee
1928,there were no significant differences in pain scores either at rest or on movement of the operative knee among the preop pre postop and postop groups
1929,the consumption of fentanyl via pca showed no significant differences among the groups
1930,there is no difference in pain relief whether diclofenac is given preoperatively or postoperatively in patients undergoing unilateral ambulatory knee arthroscopy
1931,preoperative and postoperative treatment with diclofenac potassium is equally effective
1932,new simple rapid and precise reversed phase liquid chromatographic rp lc method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of diclofenac potassium dp and methocarbamol mt in ternary mixture with guaifenesin gf degradation product of methocarbamol
1933,chromatographic separation was achieved on a symmetry waters c column mm x
1935,gradient elution based on phosphate buffer ph acetonitrile at a flow rate of ml min was applied
1936,the uv detector was operated at nm for dp and nm for mt and gf
1937,linearity accuracy and precision were found to be acceptable over the concentration ranges of and microg ml for dp mt and gf respectively
1938,the optimized method proved to be specific robust and accurate for the quality control of the cited drugs in pharmaceutical preparation
1939,diclofenac is a benzene acetic acid derivative that acts like other nsaids by inhibiting cyclo oxygenase isoforms that mediate the body s production of the prostaglandins implicated in pain and inflammation
1940,diclofenac is widely available as a sodium or potassium salt
1941,diclofenac potassium tablets are known as immediate release diclofenac as absorption takes place in the gastrointestinal tract whereas delayed release enteric coated diclofenac tablets resist dissolution until reaching the duodenum
1942,an existing review showed that diclofenac was an effective treatment for acute postoperative pain but did not address the distinction between potassium and sodium salts due to lack of data
1943,the aim of this update is to gather and add appropriate information published subsequently and data permitting examine any potential differences between the two different diclofenac formulations
1944,to assess single dose oral diclofenac for the treatment of acute postoperative pain and determine whether there are differences between the different formulations
1945,we searched the cochrane library issue medline to may embase to biological abstracts to the oxford pain relief database to pubmed to and reference lists of articles
1946,randomised double blind placebo controlled clinical trials of single dose oral diclofenac sodium or diclofenac potassium for acute postoperative pain in adults
1947,two reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion in the review quality and extracted data
1948,the area under the pain relief versus time curve was used to derive the proportion of patients prescribed diclofenac or placebo with at least pain relief over four to six hours using validated equations
1949,the number needed to treat nnt was calculated
1950,information on adverse effects was also collected
1951,one additional trial was included and added to the six trials included in the original review
1952,all seven trials provided data for quantitative analysis patients were treated with diclofenac and were treated with placebo
1953,the nnt for at least relief over four to six hours with diclofenac mg mg and mg compared with placebo was ci to to and to respectively
1954,though higher doses produced lower better nnts statistical significance was not achieved
1955,there was no significant difference between diclofenac mg and placebo in the proportion of patients experiencing dizziness headache nausea or vomiting
1956,the weighted median duration of analgesia was hours for placebo hours for diclofenac mg and hours for diclofenac mg sensitivity analyses for drug formulation pain model trial size and quality did not reveal any statistically significant differences
1957,oral diclofenac is an effective single dose treatment for moderate to severe postoperative pain
1958,there was no significant difference between diclofenac and placebo in the incidence of adverse effects or between diclofenac sodium and potassium different pain models smaller and larger trials and trials of higher and lower quality
1959,to enhance the transdermal delivery of diclofenac acid da by using o acylmenthol as a penetration enhancer and complexing with amines or by a combination of the two methods
1960,the skin permeability of diclofenac was tested in vitro across rat skin with each of the evaluated permeants in a saturated isopropyl myristate ipm donor solution
1961,a fold increase in the flux of diclofenac was observed by ion pair formation with diethylamine however the cations with hydroxyl groups had negative effects on the transdermal delivery of diclofenac
1962,isopropyl methylcyclohexyl hydroxypanoate and isopropyl methylcyclohexyl heptanoate produced significant increase in the permeation of diclofenac potassium d k however both of them were ineffective for the other diclofenac salts including diclofenac diethylamine d deta diclofenac ethanolamine d ea diclofenac diethanolamine d dea diclofenac triethanolamine and diclofenac n hydroxylethyl piperidine
1963,isopropyl methylcyclohexyl tetradecanoate was effective on the penetration of d k d deta d ea and d dea
1964,also it is exciting to note that the combined use of diethylamine with isopropyl methylcyclohexyl tetradecanoate produced a fold increase in accumulation amount of diclofenac compared with da in ipm
1965,the use of ion pair in combination with o acylmenthol is necessary to further increase the diclofenac flux to provide better compliance for the patients undergoing clinical therapy
1966,calcium and potassium intakes inversely correlate with blood pressure in experimental hypertension
1967,therefore we examined the effects of calcium and potassium supplements alone and in combination on arterial tone in spontaneously hypertensive rats shr
1968,wistar kyoto wky rats served as normotensive controls
1969,calcium and potassium contents in the control diet were both while those in supplemented chows were and respectively
1970,the sodium content of all diets was moderately elevated to
1971,after weeks of the study systolic blood pressures in shr on high calcium and on high potassium diets were markedly lower about and mmhg respectively than in hypertensive controls while combined supplementation of these cations reduced blood pressure even further about mmhg
1972,responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the study
1973,both high calcium and high potassium diets improved the impaired relaxation to acetylcholine ach in shr while the combination of these supplements completely normalized this response
1974,cyclo oxygenase inhibition by diclofenac augmented the relaxation to ach in hypertensive controls but not in the other groups
1975,nevertheless enhanced endothelium mediated dilatation was still observed in the presence of diclofenac and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor n g nitro l arginine methyl ester l name in all supplemented groups
1976,interestingly additional blockade of ca activated k channels by tetraethylammonium abolished the improved relaxation to ach in shr on high calcium and on high potassium but distinct responses were still observed in wky rats and shr on the combined supplement
1977,when hyperpolarization of smooth muscle was prevented by precontraction of the preparations with mm kcl only marginal differences were observed in the diclofenac and l name resistant relaxations to ach between the study groups
1978,finally endothelium independent vasorelaxations of noradrenaline precontracted rings to nitroprusside isoprenaline and cromakalim were comparably augmented by all supplements
1979,in conclusion the vascular mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effect of high calcium and high potassium diets during moderately elevated sodium intake in shr may involve enhanced arterial hyperpolarization increased smooth muscle sensitivity to nitric oxide and decreased production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids
1980,the administration of these cations in combination was more effective than either of them alone in reducing blood pressure and restoring arterial tone
1981,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are assembled into two categories cyclooxygenase cox sparing inhibitors of cox and non selective nsaids
1982,diclofenac diclo is a non selective nsaid that has been linked to serious side effects including gastric ulcers and renal injury
1983,in this study we examine the effect of poly lactic co glycolic acid nanoformulation on diclo associated adverse events and pharmacokinetics using a nanoparticle np formulation previously developed in our laboratory
1984,rats were administered a single dose of methylcellulose veh blank np diclo mg kg or a diclo np suspension equivalent to the diclo dose
1985,urinary and blood parameters were measured at baseline and following treatment
1986,duodenal and gastric prostaglandin e pge and duodenal myeloperoxidase mpo were collected to assess inflammation at hrs post treatment
1987,the mean percent change from baseline in sodium excretion rate mol min g body weight differed significantly from veh in the np p diclo p and diclo np p groups
1988,the differences among groups did not reach significance for plasma sodium or potassium concentrations potassium excretion rate gastric pge or intestinal biomarker concentrations
1989,regarding renal histopathology diclo produced considerably more necrosis compared to veh while diclo np did not elicit notable differences from veh
1990,our results suggest that over the duration and dosage examined diclo np may reduce renal necrosis without influencing other side effects or drug characteristics
1991,twik related k trek potassium channels are members of the two pore domain potassium channel family and contribute to background potassium conductances in many cell types where their activity can be regulated by a variety of physiologic and pharmacologic mediators
1992,fenamates such as ffa flufenamic acid trifluoromethyl phenyl amino benzoic acid mfa mefenamic acid dimethylphenyl aminobenzoic acid nfa niflumic acid trifluoromethyl phenyl amino nicotinic acid and diclofenac dichlorophenylamino phenyl acetic acid and the related experimental drug bl tetrahydro naphthalen yl h tetrazol yl phenyl amine enhance the activity of trek currents and we show that bl is the most potent of these compounds
1993,alternative translation initiation produces a shorter n terminus truncated form of trek with a much reduced open probability and a proposed increased permeability to sodium compared with the longer form
1994,we show that both forms of trek can be activated by fenamates and that a number of mutations that affect trek channel gating occlude the action of fenamates but only in the longer form of trek
1995,furthermore fenamates produce a marked enhancement of current through the shorter truncated form of trek and reveal a k selective channel like the long form
1996,these results provide insight into the mechanism of trek channel activation by fenamates and given the role of trek channels in pain they suggest a novel analgesic mechanism for these compounds
1997,the study aims to simultaneously control micropollutants and bromate formations by using ozonation and peroxone process
1998,the batch experiments were run with variations in specific ozone dose sod and hydrogen peroxide to ozone h
1999,a sensitive and simple chemiluminescent cl method for the determination of diclofenac sodium has been developed by combining the flow injection technique and its sensitizing effect on the weak cl reaction between formaldehyde and acidic potassium permanganate

2002,this method is rapid sensitive simple and shows good selectivity and reproducibility
2003,the proposed method has been successfully applied to the determination of the studied diclofenac sodium in pharmaceutical preparations with satisfactory results
2004,furthermore the possible mechanism for the cl reaction has been discussed in detail on the basis of uv and cl spectra
2005,migraine is a neurological disorder resulting in large socioeconomic burden
2006,this network meta analysis nma is designed to compare the relative efficacy and tolerability of non steroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaids and triptans
2007,we conducted systematic searches in database pubmed and embase
2008,treatment effectiveness was compared by synthesizing direct and indirect evidences using nma
2009,the surface under curve ranking area sucra was created to rank those interventions
2010,eletriptan and rizatriptan are superior to sumatriptan zolmitriptan almotriptan ibuprofen and aspirin with respect to pain relief
2011,when analyzing h nausea absence rizatriptan has a better efficacy than sumatriptan while other treatments indicate no distinctive difference compared with placebo
2012,furthermore sumatriptan demonstrates a higher incidence of all adverse event compared with diclofenac potassium ibuprofen and almotriptan
2013,this study suggests that eletriptan may be the most suitable therapy for migraine from a comprehensive point of view
2014,in the meantime ibuprofen may also be a good choice for its excellent tolerability
2015,multi component medication also attracts attention and may be a promising avenue for the next generation of migraine treatment
2016,an acute coronary syndrome acs occurring during the course of an allergic reaction is called kounis syndrome ks
2017,the second case of ks induced by diclofenac potassium dp is presented in this report
2018,a year old man was brought to our emergency department with the possible diagnosis of anaphylactic shock by the ambulance staff

2031,plasma furosemide and nsaid concentrations urine furosemide sodium and potassium concentrations and urine output were determined throughout the h period following furosemide administration
2032,orally administered ibuprofen significantly increased furosemide auc t and auc inf and decreased total body cl r max and clr geometric mean ratios compared with furosemide control
2033,oral and topical diclofenac had no pharmacokinetic effects on furosemide
2034,ibuprofen increased sodium excretion ae and decreased sodium r max and oral diclofenac decreased urine output vu
2035,detp had no effect on furosemide pharmacodynamics total systemic exposure to diclofenac during detp treatment was that of oral diclofenac
2036,treatments were generally safe with subjects reporting a total of adverse events
2037,pharmacodynamic effects were seen with oral diclofenac urine output and ibuprofen urine sodium excretion
2038,furosemide also affected plasma and urine pharmacokinetic profiles
2039,pharmacologic effects of detp on furosemide were not observed under these conditions
2040,additional research is warranted to delineate the potential interactions of other nsaids with furosemide and other loop diuretics

2048,efficacy end points included the summed pain intensity difference over and hours spid and total pain relief at and hours totpar and median times to onset of perceptible and meaningful relief analgesic onset and rescue medication use analgesic duration and cumulative percentage of patients using rescue medication
2049,tolerability was assessed using vital sign measurements and spontaneous reporting of adverse events
2050,a total of patients women men mean age years were enrolled
2051,all prosorb diclofenac k groups showed higher spid and totpar scores and longer median times to rescue medication use than the placebo group all p
2052,for these end points a dose response relationship was evident between the mg dose and the and mg doses p or the and mg doses were similar
2053,in the diclofenac groups median onset times for first perceptible or min and meaningful or min relief were significantly more rapid than placebo p or
2054,proportions of patients requiring rescue analgesic were or with diclofenac compared with with placebo
2055,proportions of patients assigning a global evaluation of good or better was or with diclofenac compared with for placebo
2056,tolerability was similar across all treatment groups
2057,in this study of patients treated for pain following dental impaction surgery single doses of prosorb diclofenac k and mg were more efficacious than placebo with respect to reduction of pain
2058,all doses provided a rapid analgesic onset and were well tolerated
2059,cyclosporine csa and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids are used together to manage arthritic disorders with an immune component
2060,previous reports showed contrasting effects for nsaids on csa nephrotoxicity and acute elevations in blood pressure
2061,both effects were ameliorated or exaggerated after selective cyclooxygenase cox and nonselective cox inhibition respectively
2062,here we investigated i the interaction of csa with nsaids possessing variable cox cox selectivities on hemodynamic left ventricular lv and cardiac autonomic and histologic profiles and ii role of nadph oxidase nox rho kinase rock pathway in the interaction

2074,his initial laboratory work up showed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia
2075,he also experienced a seizure encephalopathy and had a plasmic score of thus raising concerns for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
2076,he underwent emergent plasmapheresis which improved his clinical condition
2077,the diagnosis was confirmed by assessing the levels of disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type motif member which was less than
2078,in addition his skin biopsy was positive for patchy complement deposition demonstrating complement dysregulation
2079,thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a rare condition that can be acquired
2080,our case is rare because it represents the first report of diclofenac potassium induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with subjacent complement activation and dysregulation
2081,early recognition and aggressive management led to a favorable outcome
2082,in order to develop ph sensitive hydrogels for controlled drug release we have graft copolymerized glycidyl methacrylate gma with comonomers acrylic acid acrylamide and acrylonitrile onto chitosan ch by using potassium persulphate kps as free radical initiator in aqueous solution
2083,the optimum percent grafting for gma was recorded for g chitosan at kps mol l gma mol l reaction temperature c and reaction time h in ml ho
2084,binary monomers were grafted for five different concentrations at optimum grafting conditions evaluated for gma alone onto chitosan
2085,the graft copolymers were characterized by ftir xrd tga and sem
2086,the swelling properties of chitosan and graft copolymers were investigated at different ph to define their end uses in sustained release of an anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium
2087,percent drug release w r t
2088,drug loaded in polymeric sample was studied as function of time in buffer solutions of ph and in vitro release data was analyzed using fick s law
2089,chitosan grafted with binary monomers gma co aam and gma co an showed very good results for sustained release of drug at ph
2090,in recent days response surface methodology rsm has widely been applied for development and optimization of cost effective formulations with required quality
2091,study comprised of three steps including micromeritic comparison of different powder blends of placebo and diclofenac potassium dp formulation designing with ccrd design expert version and stability testing of selected formulations by using r gui
2092,ten formulations f f were developed using microcrystalline cellulose avicel ph x methocel km x and magnesium stearate x while responses were friability and drug release
2093,blending rate constant was determined at and minutes
2094,the results of physicochemical parameters were found within acceptable limits
2095,after in vitro testing at ph ph and ph mechanism of drug release kinetic analysis and statistical evaluation were carried out by model independent model dependent and one way anova methods
2096,most formulations followed zero order kinetics at higher ph
2097,fickian release n was observed with greater than and less than anova indicated no significant variation within and between formulations as p values were found to be
2098,the aim of this study was to examine if the peripheral antinociceptive effects of diclofenac and indomethacin involve the sequential participation of no and cgmp synthesis followed by potassium channel opening
2099,the peripheral antinociceptive effects of diclofenac indomethacin pinacidil a potassium channel opener and atrial natriuretic peptide anp which increases cgmp content in a no independent manner were assayed using the formalin test in the rat
2100,all compounds produced significant local antinociception
2101,diclofenac effect was reverted by n g l nitro arginine methyl ester l name an inhibitor of no synthesis by h oxadiazolo a quinoxalin one odq an inhibitor soluble guanylyl cyclase and by the potassium channel blockers glibenclamide tolbutamide charybdotoxin and apamin
2102,pinacidil effect was blocked by glibenclamide tolbutamide charybdotoxin and apamin strongly suggesting that potassium channel opening results in antinociception
2103,anp effect was inhibited by the potassium channel blockers but not by l name suggesting that potassium channel opening is a consequence of an increased cgmp content
2104,indomethacin was effective but at doses higher than those of diclofenac and could not be blocked by l name nor by potassium channel blockers
2105,the present results suggest that the l arginine no cgmp potassium channel pathway is involved in the peripheral antinociceptive effect of diclofenac but not of indomethacin and thus provide evidence for differences in mechanisms of action among nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids
2106,the effect of the glycolipid hexadecyl d glucopyranoside incorporated in microemulsions me towards the enhancement of skin absorption and skin permeation of diclofenac sodium ds was evaluated
2107,a franz diffusion cell with a piece of pig s ear epidermis indicated that the optimized me formulation with glycolipid wt exhibited significantly higher permeability than the conventional formulations
2108,the releasing profiles of ds from me formulations exhibited first order release kinetics resembling a diffusion controlled release model for the first h
2109,incorporating hexadecyl d glucopyranoside in me formulations shows significant potential as a delivery vehicle in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry
2110,the primary objective of this guideline is to assist the practitioner in choosing an appropriate acute medication for an individual with migraine based on current evidence in the medical literature and expert consensus
2111,it is focused on patients with episodic migraine headache on days a month
2112,a detailed search strategy was used to find a relevant meta analyses systematic reviews and randomized double blind controlled trials
2113,recommendations were graded with the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade working group using a consensus group
2114,in addition a general literature review and expert consensus were used for aspects of acute therapy for which randomized controlled trials were not available
2115,twelve acute medications received a strong recommendation for use in acute migraine therapy almotriptan eletriptan frovatriptan naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zomitriptan asa ibuprofen naproxen sodium diclofenac potassium and acetaminophen
2116,four received a weak recommendation for use dihydroergotamine ergotamine codeine containing combination analgesics and tramadol containing medications
2117,three of these were not recommended for routine use ergotamine and codeine and tramadol containing medications
2118,strong recommendations were made to avoid use of butorphanol and butalbital containing medications
2119,metoclopramide and domperidone were strongly recommended for use when necessary
2120,our analysis also resulted in the formulation of eight general acute migraine management strategies
2121,these were grouped into two mild moderate attack strategies two moderate severe attack or nsaid failure strategies three refractory migraine strategies and a vasoconstrictor unresponsive contraindicated strategy
2122,additional were developed for menstrual migraine during pregnancy and migraine during lactation
2123,this guideline provides evidence based advice on acute pharmacological migraine therapy and should be helpful to both health professionals and patients the available medications have been organized into a series of strategies based on patient clinical features
2124,these strategies may help practitioners make appropriate acute medication choices for patients with migraine
2125,primary dysmenorrhea which refers to painful spasmodic cramping in the lower abdomen just before or during menstruation is the most common gynecological complaint in women of reproductive age
2126,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs have been prescribed as the first line therapy for pain relief from dysmenorrhea
2127,we aimed to investigate the efficacy of the daily recommended dose mg of diclofenac potassium administered at set intervals across the first h of menstruation in treating severe menstrual pain in women with severe primary dysmenorrhea
2128,in a randomized placebo controlled double blind cross over study women rated their menstrual pain intensity on a mm visual analog scale across set time intervals over a h period
2129,menstrual pain intensity was significantly reduced after taking the first capsule of diclofenac and remained consistently lower p compared with initial pain intensity in the morning before treatment throughout the day evening and into the next morning
2130,also women rated their pain intensity as significantly lower p at each time point across the h time interval of the cycle when receiving diclofenac compared with the cycle when they received placebo
2131,no woman required rescue medication when taking diclofenac potassium compared with six women taking rescue medications during the placebo trial
2132,when taking only placebo women rated their menstrual pain intensity as persistently severe across the first h of menstruation
2133,these results show that the recommended daily dose of diclofenac potassium in three mg doses across the day and evening offers effective menstrual pain relief across h compared with placebo in women with severe primary dysmenorrhea
2134,a new liquid capsule formulation of low dose diclofenac k in mg and mg dosages has been developed to provide the patient with an easier to swallow form than the current low dose tablets
2135,the new formulation is expected to have a faster rate of absorption and comparable overall bioavailability compared with the tablet formulations
2136,to compare the systemic bioavailability of diclofenac from the new mg liquid capsule vs the currently registered diclofenac k mg tablets and to evaluate the safety of the mg liquid capsule
2137,in this randomized open label crossover comparative bioavailability study healthy subjects mean age years were given a single dose of diclofenac k mg liquid capsule or mg tablets over day treatment periods separated by a washout period of days
2138,the total systemic exposure to diclofenac as measured by the mean aucs was equivalent between treatments
2139,however the geometric mean cmax for the mg liquid capsule was almost double that of mg tablets vs ng ml while the median tmax was minutes faster with the mg liquid capsule and the geometric mean auctmax ref for the mg liquid capsule ng h ml was much higher than for mg tablets ng h ml
2140,the estimated auctmax ref ratio of mg liquid capsule to mg tablets was indicating much higher early exposure to diclofenac from the mg liquid capsule
2141,both formulations were very well tolerated and only one adverse event was considered drug related headache after taking the diclofenac k mg liquid capsule
2142,diclofenac k mg liquid capsule was equivalent to diclofenac k mg tablets in terms of overall systemic exposure to diclofenac
2143,however the rate of absorption of diclofenac was much faster from the liquid capsule than from the tablets with a much greater early exposure to diclofenac
2144,both formulations were very well tolerated
2145,the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac potassium mg were compared with those of glafenine mg in outpatients suffering from moderate to severe dental pain
2146,throughout the four day trial period patients diclofenac potassium n mean age yrs
2147,glafenine n mean age yrs
2148,were randomised in a double blind fashion to receive one tablet of either medications three times daily together with an antibiotic ampicillin mg hourly
2149,half an hour following the administration of the first analgesic dose both treatment groups showed highly statistically significant p reductions in the mean pain level when compared with their baseline values
2150,the mean decrease of pain level in diclofenac potassium group after hour was significantly p greater than that in the glafenine group
2151,moreover the percent of pain free patients after hour in the diclofenac potassium group was significantly higher p compared with those in the glafenine group
2152,the mean decreases in pain and tenderness on the second and fourth days in relation to their initial values were greater in the diclofenac potassium treated patients than the glafenine treated ones
2153,the overall evaluation of therapeutic effect was considered excellent in of the diclofenac potassium patients compared with of the glafenine patients
2154,furthermore of the diclofenac potassium patients compared with of the glafenine ones expressed their willingness to use the trial medication again in similar conditions
2155,none of the patients in both treatment groups discontinued the trial due to unwanted effects
2156,both therapies were well tolerated
2157,only one patient in the diclofenac potassium treatment group experienced slight diarrhoea
2158,it can be concluded from this study that both medications are effective and well tolerated in the management of dental pain
2159,however diclofenac potassium with its fast onset of effect is particularly suitable in the management of acute painful conditions
2160,the objective of this report was to evaluate the transcorneal permeation of diclofenac potassium dcp as a function of temperature from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc matrix film containing triethanolamine tem as plasticizer and benzalkonium chloride bkc as preservative
2161,activation energy ea enthalpy h entropy s and free energy g of permeation diffusion and partition were evaluated to understand the underlying mechanism of permeation
2162,permeation improved with the presence of both the plasticizer and preservative compared to preservative alone
2163,further increased amount of tem in the film increased drug transport across the cornea
2164,decreased ea value of the film supported the fact
2165,rise of temperature from to and c increased permeation in all the films
2166,ocular residence of the film in vivo in the rabbit revealed that the film swelled by pronounced lachrymal fluid uptake and traces of hydrogel remained still at the end of h of application
2167,absence of characteristic exothermic peak of the drug in the thermogram of film formulations indicated the molecular dispersion of drug in polymer matrix
2168,scanning electron microscopy indicated that the drug crystal size decreased with increasing concentration of tem in presence of bkc due to effective wetting of drug particles by the polymer
2169,to compare the antipyretic and analgesic effects of a single oral dose of diclofenac potassium or mg with paracetamol mg and placebo in patients with fever resulting from acute febrile sore throat
2170,this was a multicentre double blind double dummy randomised placebo controlled parallel group study conducted at primary care centres throughout france
2171,in total adult patients with acute febrile sore throat fever degrees c were randomised to the five treatment groups
2172,patients received one oral dose of medication
2173,fever spontaneous throat pain and pain on swallowing were recorded over hours
2174,if acute symptoms persisted hours after study drug administration the patient was allowed to take rescue medication and discontinue the trial
2175,the antipyretic effects of diclofenac potassium and mg and paracetamol mg were significantly greater than placebo
2176,the antipyretic effects of diclofenac potassium and mg were numerically greater than paracetamol mg which was comparable to the effect of diclofenac potassium mg
2177,the analgesic effects of the higher doses diclofenac potassium and mg and of paracetamol mg were significantly better than placebo
2178,summary efficacy measures over the first hours post dose showed a dose response relationship among the diclofenac doses with statistically significant differences on some outcomes between the mg and the mg doses
2179,on the global efficacy evaluation for relief of fever and throat pain patients rated both diclofenac potassium and mg significantly higher than paracetamol mg p
2180,in contrast paracetamol mg and diclofenac mg were not rated significantly higher than placebo
2181,diclofenac potassium was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to that of placebo and slightly favourable compared with that of paracetamol
2182,diclofenac potassium administered as single doses of and mg significantly reduced fever and throat pain in patients with acute febrile sore throat
2183,the overall efficacy of these doses was rated significantly higher than that of paracetamol mg or placebo
2184,a dose response relationship was seen between placebo and the three diclofenac doses
2185,on most outcomes paracetamol mg was similar to or only slightly better than the diclofenac potassium mg dose
2186,diclofenac potassium mg is the lowest unit dose that could be recommended to provide reliable reduction of oral temperature and relief of throat pain
2187,the hypertensive effect of the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine csa is paralleled and probably triggered by impaired arterial baroreceptor sensitivity brs
2188,here we asked if these effects of csa are influenced by co administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids and if the oxidative nadph oxidase nadphox rho kinase rock pathway mediates this interaction
2189,female rats were treated for days with csa mg kg day diclofenac dic cox cox inhibitor mg kg day celecoxib cox inhibitor mg kg day or their combinations
2190,baroreflex curves relating changes in heart rate hr to increases or decreases in blood pressure bp evoked by phenylephrine pe and sodium nitroprusside snp respectively were constructed and slopes of the curves were taken as measures of brs
2191,compared with control rats csa increased bp and reduced reflex chronotropic responses as indicated by the significantly smaller brs
2192,depending on the nature of the cardiovascular response nadphox and rock contribute variably to the worsened cardiovascular profile in csa dic treated rats
2193,further celecoxib rather than diclofenac could be a better choice as an add on therapy to csa in autoimmune arthritic conditions
2194,the objective of this study was to investigate the potential effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac potassium in beagle dogs after oral coadministration
2195,five male beagle dogs received a single oral mg dose of diclofenac potassium alone in phase i and along with a single oral mg dose of itraconazole in phase ii
2196,blood samples obtained for hours post dose were analysed for diclofenac concentration using a validated high performance liquid chromatography hplc assay method
2197,the area under plasma concentration time curve auc maximum plasma concentration c max time to reach c max t max and elimination half life t were calculated for diclofenac before and after itraconazole administration
2198,the coadministration of itraconazole with diclofenac potassium has resulted in a significant reduction in auc and c max of diclofenac which was about and respectively
2199,no statistically significant differences were observed for t max and t of diclofenac between the two phases
2200,therefore it could be concluded that oral coadministration of itraconazole may have the potential to affect the absorption of diclofenac as indicated by the significant reduction in its auc and c max in beagle dogs
2201,several clinical trials have demonstrated that low doses of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs relieve episodic tension type headache eth
2202,the aims of this placebo controlled study were to determine whether single doses of diclofenac k and mg effectively relieve eth in adults and to compare it to ibuprofen mg
2203,a single dose multicentre randomised double blind double dummy clinical trial was conducted at primary care centres in germany
2204,all subjects had a history of eth according to the classification of the international headache society
2205,of subjects randomised used the study drugs for an episode of tension headache occurring within one month after enrolment diclofenac k mg n diclofenac k mg n ibuprofen mg n and placebo n
2206,the primary efficacy variable was total pain relief calculated as the time weighted sum of the pain relief assessments from baseline to the h evaluation time totpar
2207,for totpar all active treatments were superior to placebo no statistically significant difference between the three active treatments could be detected
2208,a similar pattern was also observed with regard to totpar h evaluation time or maxtotpar at and h weighted pain intensity difference at and h spid spid percentage of patients with complete headache relief at h end of study global evaluation and time to rescue medication
2209,the number needed to treat nnt at h was in the ibuprofen mg group in the diclofenac k mg group and in the diclofenac k mg group
2210,these differences were not statistically significant
2211,diclofenac k administered as single doses of and mg effectively relieves eth and is comparable to ibuprofen mg
2212,the clinical utility of diclofenac potassium a commonly prescribed analgesic that provides mild to moderate pain relief may be hindered by its delayed depressed and or inconsistent absorption characteristics
2213,a diclofenac potassium formulation using proprietary dispersion technology prosorb was developed to overcome these limitations
2214,the authors evaluated and compared the pharmacokinetics pk of investigational diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc preparations and one investigational diclofenac liquid formulation each incorporating the proprietary dispersion technology to establish bioequivalence and identify a formulation for further clinical study
2215,in an open label single dose three way crossover relative bioavailability study healthy volunteers were randomized to receive each of the mg dpsgc formulations development processes a and b and the ml mg liquid diclofenac formulation similar to the fill liquid used in the dpsgc products during three inpatient visits
2216,each dose was separated by days
2217,plasma samples were collected at preselected time points through hours post dose
2218,diclofenac concentrations were determined using a validated hplc method
2219,bioequivalence was established within the to acceptance range
2220,safety and tolerability were monitored throughout
2221,area under the plasma concentration time curves auc t for the three formulations were between and ng hr ml and peak plasma concentrations c max were between and ng ml with the dpsgc process b group having the highest c max
2222,the times to c max t max were all below minutes with the liquid formulation producing the shortest t max minutes
2223,plasma concentration time course profiles were similar for all three rapidly dispersing diclofenac potassium formulations
2224,one mild adverse event was observed lingual paresthesia and one participant discontinued due to an unrelated event acute tonsillitis
2225,these data show that diclofenac potassium formulations using proprietary dispersion technology are rapidly and consistently absorbed
2226,these characteristics may be beneficial in settings where rapid and consistent drug absorption is desirable
2227,these results may differ in other patient populations such as those experiencing pain or illness
2228,diclofenac cas is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug largely used mainly to relief pain of various origin
2229,diclofenac is present on the market as free acid as sodium salt cas and as potassium salt cas
2230,the last salification form has shown a prompter absorption rate and a faster onset of analgesic activity than the acid form and sodium salt
2231,this paper extensively reviews three trials carried out on healthy volunteers where potassium salt of diclofenac present in three fast acting formulations namely sachets trial tablets trial and oral drops trial were compared to reference tablet formulations from the market
2232,a very fast absorption rate was encountered with the three test formulations with the peak reached in one case min and in most cases within min after dosing
2233,the quick absorption rate of test formulations was attributed to the special combination of the salt of diclofenac with a dynamic buffering agent namely bicarbonate present in the test formulations and covered by an international patent
2234,the prompt absorption of diclofenac from the new fast acting formulations was accompanied by the presence of only one peak whereas the reference formulations produced in most cases two peaks as widely described in literature
2235,this finding suggested the hypothesis that the absorption of test formulations should occur in a shorter tract of the gut
2236,the faster absorption of diclofenac from the three fast acting formulations is expected to produce a faster onset of analgesic action which highlights these new formulations as particularly indicated to relief pain of any origin
2237,diclofenac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug with potent analgesic and anti inflammatory properties
2238,an immediate release formulation containing a low dose of mg diclofenac potassium k is marketed as over the counter otc medication in most european countries
2239,an immediate release formulation containing mg diclofenac k has now also been approved for otc use
2240,this study assessed the bioequivalence of two immediate release diclofenac formulations when administered at the same dose
2241,a randomized crossover open label study was conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the bioequivalence of single mg dose of diclofenac k in two formulations x mg as film coated tablets and x mg as sugar coated tablet
2242,blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were obtained over hours post administration
2243,plasma time courses of diclofenac were similar for the tested formulations
2244,mean auc yen was ng x h ml mean sd for the film coated and ng x h ml for the sugar coated formulation respectively
2245,the sided confidence interval for the mean test reference ratio of aucinfinity fell within the predetermined equivalence range of
2246,both formulations were rapidly absorbed median time to maximal plasma concentration was min in each group
2247,adverse events peripheral erythema on the hand headache hypoesthesia reported during the study were of mild severity and were considered as unlikely to be drug related
2248,the two diclofenac k immediate release formulations were pharmacokinetically similar
2249,it can be concluded that the new sugar coated tablet formulation is equivalent to the available film coated tablet formulation with respect to the extent of diclofenac absorption
2250,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids have different selectivity to inhibit cyclooxygenase cox and cox
2251,treatment with nsaids has been associated with kidney side effects
2252,we compared the effect of a selected group of nsaids with different cox cox selectivities on urinary sodium and potassium excretion in rats
2253,each treatment with rofecoxib celecoxib meloxicam diclofenac and flurbiprofen and mg kg respectively and placebo was administered orally once daily for days
2254,urine was collected h after each dose
2255,urinary sodium and potassium excretion and urine flow rate were compared with placebo
2256,as compared with placebo rofecoxib celecoxib diclofenac and flurbiprofen significantly reduced excretion rate of sodium rofecoxib vs celecoxib vs diclofenac vs and flurbiprofen vs micromol min x g and potassium rofecoxib vs celecoxib vs diclofenac vs and flurbiprofen vs micromol min x g
2257,rofecoxib and flurbiprofen significantly reduced urine flow rate
2258,meloxicam had no significant effect on either sodium and potassium excretion or on the urine flow rate
2259,at the examined dosage level no relationship was found between reported cox cox selectivity and urinary electrolytes excretion
2260,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids adversely interact with aspirin diminishing its antiplatelet effect and potentially placing patients at an increased risk for recurrent thrombotic events
2261,this crossover study aimed to determine whether the topical nsaid diclofenac epolamine patch or oral diclofenac mg interfered with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin mg twelve healthy men and women aged were included
2262,participants were randomized into treatment arms aspirin diclofenac potassium mg diclofenac patch diclofenac potassium plus asa mg and diclofenac patch plus aspirin
2263,platelet responsiveness was determined using whole blood impedance aggregation wba to collagen g ml and arachidonic acid aa mm and was sampled every hours
2264,no significant difference in platelet function was observed following the diclofenac patch and aspirin vs aspirin alone
2265,oral diclofenac produced a mixed effect with significant reduction in platelet inhibition at hour and hour following aspirin administration
2266,topical diclofenac does not significantly interfere with the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and may be a safer alternative to the oral formulation
2267,docosahexaenoic acid dha is an omega polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa that has shown gastroprotective cardioprotective neuroprotective anti inflammatory and antinociceptive effects in different models
2268,however its action mechanism is still not well defined
2269,reports indicate that some pufas regulate potassium k
2270,the aim of the present study was the formulation and evaluation of controlled release polymeric tablets of diclofenac potassium by wet granulation method for the release rate release pattern and the mechanism involved in drug release
2271,formulations having three grades of polymer ethocel p fp p fp p fp in several drugs to polymer ratios and were compressed into tablets using wet granulation method
2272,co excipients were added to some selected formulations to investigate their enhancement effect on in vitro drug release patterns
2273,in vitro drug release studies were performed using usp method rotating basket method and phosphate buffer ph was used as a dissolution medium
2274,the similarities and dissimilarities of release profiles of test formulations with reference standard were checked using f similarity factor and f dissimilarity factor
2275,mathematical kinetic models were employed to determine the release mechanism and drug release kinetics
2276,the clinical utility of diclofenac potassium a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug may be lessened by inconsistent gastrointestinal absorption
2277,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc is an investigational formulation that uses prosorb dispersion technology to facilitate rapid and consistent gastrointestinal absorption
2278,in this study the pharmacokinetic pk properties of dpsgc are investigated and compared with a commercially available oral diclofenac potassium tablet in patients after primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy
2279,in an open label randomized study patients received prosorb d mg the liquid equivalent of dpsgc dpsgc mg dpsgc mg or immediate release diclofenac potassium mg tablet administered every hours for a hour inpatient period followed by days of outpatient dosing
2280,diclofenac steady state pk was evaluated over an hour sampling period days after surgery
2281,delayed and or multiple peaks in the diclofenac plasma concentration time course profiles occurred more frequently with the commercially available oral diclofenac potassium mg tablet than with the other dpsgc formulations
2282,pk data for prosorb d mg liquid dpsgc mg dpsgc mg and diclofenac potassium mg tablet revealed mean peak plasma concentrations cmax of and ng ml respectively whereas area under the plasma concentration curve values were and ng hour ml respectively
2283,mean times to cmax tmax were and h respectively
2284,when compared with absorption characteristics of diclofenac potassium mg tablet dpsgc was more rapidly and consistently absorbed after bunionectomy
2285,these characteristics should be advantageous when rapid pain relief is desired
2286,investigation on the toxic effects of pharmaceutical drugs namely clofibric acid ca and diclofenac dcf were studied in a common carp cyprinus carpio at different concentrations such as and g l for a short term period of h under static bioassay method
2287,at all concentrations red blood cell rbc plasma sodium na potassium k and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase got levels were decreased in fish treated with ca and dcf
2288,contrastingly white blood cell wbc plasma glucose protein lactate dehydrogenase ldh and gill na k atpase level were increased
2289,however a mixed trend was observed in hemoglobin hb hematocrit hct plasma chloride cl mean cellular volume mcv mean cellular hemoglobin mch mean cellular hemoglobin concentration mchc and glutamate pyruvate transaminase gpt levels
2290,there was a significant p and p change in all parameters measured in fish exposed to different concentrations of ca and dcf
2291,in summary the alterations in hematological biochemical ionoregulatory and enzymological parameters can be used as biomarkers in monitoring the toxicity of ca and dcf in aquatic environment
2292,however more detailed studies on using of specific biomarkers to monitor the human pharmaceuticals are needed
2293,the effects of diclofenac sodium diclofenac potassium alminoprofen and aspirin on serum electrolytes serum na and k urea and creatinine were compared in rabbits in acute and chronic phases of treatment
2294,the data suggested that all the four drugs markedly increased the serum electrolytes urea and creatinine levels in both post treatment phases
2295,in conclusion present study does not present any advantage of diclofenac sodium over diclofenac potassium at electrolyte levels on short and long term treatment
2296,nevertheless current data support the evidence of renal function impairment by all the four drug therapies used in the present study which is generally caused by nsaids
2297,the aim of the present work was to characterize the electrophysiological effects of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac and to study the possible proarrhythmic potency of the drug in ventricular muscle
2298,ion currents were recorded using voltage clamp technique in canine single ventricular cells and action potentials were obtained from canine ventricular preparations using microelectrodes
2299,the proarrhythmic potency of the drug was investigated in an anaesthetized rabbit proarrhythmia model
2300,action potentials were slightly lengthened in ventricular muscle but were shortened in purkinje fibers by diclofenac m
2301,the maximum upstroke velocity was decreased in both preparations
2302,larger repolarization prolongation was observed when repolarization reserve was impaired by previous bacl application
2303,diclofenac mg kg did not prolong while dofetilide g kg significantly lengthened the qt c interval in anaesthetized rabbits
2304,the addition of diclofenac following reduction of repolarization reserve by dofetilide further prolonged qt c
2305,diclofenac alone did not induce torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia tdp while tdp incidence following dofetilide was
2306,however the combination of diclofenac and dofetilide significantly increased tdp incidence
2307,in single ventricular cells diclofenac m decreased the amplitude of rapid i kr and slow i ks delayed rectifier currents thereby attenuating repolarization reserve
2308,l type calcium current i ca was slightly diminished but the transient outward i to and inward rectifier i k potassium currents were not influenced
2309,diclofenac at therapeutic concentrations and even at high dose does not prolong repolarization markedly and does not increase the risk of arrhythmia in normal heart
2310,however high dose diclofenac treatment may lengthen repolarization and enhance proarrhythmic risk in hearts with reduced repolarization reserve
2311,halloysite is a unique biocompatible aluminosilicate clay mineral with powder particles predominantly comprising of concentrically rolled nanotubular aggregates
2312,some recent studies have also contributed to its prospective case in oral drug delivery and dosage forms albeit with limited commercial viability
2313,in this study we have investigated the use of halloysite nanotubes hnts as a directly compressible multifunctional tableting excipient using sedem diagram expert tool
2314,sedem experimentations revealed that hnts in the formulations were enough to be used as a directly compressible filler binder and disintegrant in diclofenac potassium formulations
2315,in the next phase a total of formulations blends irf of diclofenac potassium mg with hnts and starch were prepared in different ratio using simple lattice mixture design and all were found satisfactory for direct compression
2316,compressed tablets mg had narrow weight variation sd mg good hardness kg acceptable friability and fast disintegration time min
2317,moreover the cumulative dissolution at h in phosphate buffer ph was found compliant with the compendial criteria against
2318,the dissolution profile was best fitted with peppas sahlin model with fickian diffusion as the only mechanism
2320,the aim of this work was to compare the effects of supplementation of rat chow diet with potassium k and whey mineral concentrate whey a diet rich in milk minerals on blood pressure and arterial responses in vitro in spontaneously hypertensive rats shr
2321,thirty young shr and twenty wistar kyoto rats wky were allocated into five groups shr whey shr k shr wky and whey wky
2322,whey supplementation was performed by adding whey mineral concentrate to the chow which in particular increased the intake of potassium from to and also that of calcium from to and magnesium from to in the rats
2323,the k shr were given extra potassium chloride kcl so that the final potassium content in the chow was
2324,blood pressures were measured indirectly by the tail cuff method
2325,responses of mesenteric arterial rings were examined in standard organ chambers after study weeks
2326,during the week study systolic blood pressures in control shr increased steadily from to about mmhg while supplementation with either whey or potassium had a clear antihypertensive effect of about mmhg in the hypertensive rats
2327,blood pressures in the wky and whey wky groups remained comparable during the whole study
2328,in noradrenaline precontracted arterial rings endothelium dependent relaxation to acetylcholine ach as well as endothelium independent relaxations to nitroprusside and isoprenaline were attenuated in untreated shr while all these dilatory responses were similarly improved by whey and potassium supplementation
2329,the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac which reduces the synthesis of dilatory and constricting prostanoids clearly enhanced the relaxation to ach in untreated shr but was without effect in the other groups
2330,in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ng nitro l arginine methyl ester the relaxation to ach was markedly reduced in all shr groups whereas in the two wky groups distinct relaxations to ach were still present
2331,the remaining responses were partially prevented by tetraethylammonium an inhibitor of calcium activated potassium channels and the difference between untreated and potassium supplemented shr was abolished
2332,when endothelium mediated hyperpolarization of smooth muscle was prevented by precontracting the preparations with mm kcl only marginal differences were observed in relaxations to ach between untreated shr and the other groups
2333,interestingly the impaired endothelium independent relaxations to cromakalim a hyperpolarizing vasodilator acting via atp sensitive potassium channels were normalized by whey mineral and potassium diets
2334,supplementation with whey mineral and a comparable dose of potassium similarly opposed the development of experimental genetic hypertension an effect which was associated with improved arterial dilatory properties
2335,both supplements augmented the hyperpolarization related component of arterial relaxation increased the sensitivity of smooth muscle to nitric oxide and decreased the production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids
2336,therefore the beneficial effects of the whey diet could be attributed to increased intake of potassium in shr
2337,diclofenac k has been recently launched at low oral doses in different countries for over the counter use
2338,however given the considerable first pass metabolism of diclofenac the degree of absorption of diclofenac k at low doses remained to be determined
2339,the aim of this study was to determine the bioavailability of low dose diclofenac k
2340,a randomized three way cross over study was performed in subjects
2341,each received diclofenac k mg via short term i v
2342,infusion and orally at single doses of mg and mg
2343,mean sd times to maximal plasma concentration t max of diclofenac were h mg and h mg
2344,the absolute bioavailability of diclofenac k after oral administration did not differ significantly in the mg and mg dose group vs
2346,the confidence intervals for the auc infinity and auc t ratios for the two oral regimes were point estimate and point estimate respectively
2347,these values were within the acceptance criteria for bioequivalence
2348,our data indicate that diclofenac k is rapidly and well absorbed at low dose and are consistent with a rapid onset of action of the drug
2349,abbreviations auc area under plasma concentration time curve c max peak plasma concentration ci confidence interval cox cyclooxygenase d dose f absolute bioavailability t max time to reach c max
2350,in the present study we compared the effects of the selective cox inhibitor etoricoxib with those of the classical non selective nsaid diclofenac on the inflammatory process and alveolar bone loss in an experimental model of periodontitis in rats
2351,ninety male holtzman rats g were randomly sorted into four experimental groups sham cmc and ligature cmc control groups which received carboxymethylcellulose sodium cmc solution ligature diclofenac and ligature etoricoxib groups which received potassium diclofenac and etoricoxib respectively suspended in cmc mg kg day
2352,at and days after placing ligatures in the cervical region of both the lower right and left first molars the animals were euthanized
2353,at the end of each period the mandibles were collected for radiographic examination of alveolar bone loss
2354,in addition alveolar bone and periodontal ligament tissue samples were collected for cox expression analysis and gingival tissues were collected for measurement of pge contents
2355,animals with ligature induced periodontal disease showed significant increased cox gene expression at days and p on alveolar bone and periodontal ligament
2356,however both treatments resulted in significantly reduced alveolar bone loss when compared to the untreated ligature group p with no statistical difference between etoricoxib and diclofenac potassium groups
2357,this study shows that both drugs were able to reduce alveolar bone loss after periodontal disease induction
2358,when used in multimodal analgesia for acute pain nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids may reduce the requirement for opioids during the perioperative period
2359,to provide more insight into pain treatment during the outpatient period we examined the use of opioid rescue medication rm and described the relationship between pain intensity and rm use in patients with acute pain after bunionectomy
2360,patients received placebo or mg of a liquid filled capsule version of the nsaid diclofenac potassium dplfc n patients group every hours during the hour inpatient period through the end of outpatient dosing on day opioid rm hydrocodone acetaminophen tablets mg mg was available as needed but taken at least hour post study medication
2361,fewer patients taking dplfc versus placebo requested opioid rm during the inpatient period versus and also during the outpatient period versus
2362,moderate or severe pain after surgery p and p respectively or at second dose p and p respectively was predictive of rm use
2363,patients taking rm placebo dplfc reported more adverse events rm no rm
2364,most adverse events in the rm group were opioid related
2365,in summary this study shows that dplfc lowers the requirement for opioids which is associated with a reduction in the occurrence of treatment side effects while maintaining adequate analgesia for patients with moderate acute pain in both the outpatient and outpatient periods
2366,patients with more severe pain are more likely to use rm but they still use fewer opioids when treated with dplfc
2367,this suggests that multimodal treatment using dplfc and an opioid may offer an important clinical benefit in the treatment of acute pain including in the home environment
2368,a fully automated narrowbore high performance liquid chromatography hplc with column switching was developed for the simultaneous determination of aceclofenac and diclofenac from human plasma samples
2369,plasma sample microl was directly introduced onto a capcell pak mf ph column x mm i d
2370,where primary separation was occurred to remove proteins and concentrate target substances using acetonitrile potassium phosphate ph m v v
2371,the drug molecules eluted from mf ph column were focused in an intermediate column x mm i d
2372,by the valve switching step
2373,the substances enriched in intermediate column were eluted and separated on the narrowbore phenyl hexyl column x mm i d
2374,using acetonitrile potassium phosphate ph m v v when the valve status was switched back to a position
2375,the method showed excellent sensitivity detection limit of ng ml with small volume of samples microl good precision and accuracy and speed total analysis time min without any loss in chromatographic efficiency
2376,the response was linear r or over the concentration range of ng ml
2377,extensive use of pharmaceuticals in human and veterinary medicine and aquaculture practices pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms
2378,in the present investigation cirrhinus mrigala an indian major carp was exposed to different concentrations of clofibric acid ca and diclofenac dcf and certain biochemical and ionoregulatory responses were assessed under short and long term exposures
2379,during short term h exposure period plasma glucose and sodium na levels were increased at all concentrations and gl of ca and dcf treated fish
2380,plasma protein and chloride cl levels were found to be decreased at all concentrations of ca and dcf exposed fish comparatively to control groups
2381,meanwhile an increase in plasma potassium k level was noted in fish exposed to ca treatments alone and in dcf treatments it was decreased
2382,in long term exposure d plasma na and cl levels were found to be significantly increased at all concentration of ca and dcf
2383,however a biphasic trend was observed in plasma glucose protein and k levels
2384,in both the treatments a significant p and p changes were observed in all parameters measured in fish exposed to different concentrations of ca and dcf
2385,the results of the present investigation indicate that both the drugs caused significant changes in biochemical and ionoregulatory responses of fish at all concentrations
2386,the alterations of these parameters can be useful in monitoring of pharmaceutical residues present in aquatic environment
2387,the aim of this present study was to investigate the in vitro transdermal iontophoretic delivery of three diclofenac salts diclofenac sodium dfs diclofenac potassium dfp and diclofenac diethylammonium dfd
2388,a series of physicochemical and electrical variables which might affect iontophoretic permeation of diclofenac salts was studied
2389,application of ma cm current density significantly increased the transdermal flux of diclofenac salts as compared to passive transport
2390,the iontophoretic enhancement increased in the order of dfs dfp dfd
2391,the permeability coefficient of diclofenac salts all decreased with increasing donor concentration during iontophoresis
2392,the addition of buffer ions and salt ions such as nacl kcl and chcln reduced the permeation of diclofenac salts due to competition
2393,however this effect was lesser for dfd than for dfs and dfp
2394,comparing the various application modes of iontophoresis the discontinuous on off mode showed lower but more constant flux than the continuous mode
2395,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid or high doses of aspirin acetylsalicylic acid can exert detrimental effects on renal function and counteract the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure
2396,the objective of our study was to evaluate the renal effects of low dose aspirin and the nsaid diclofenac in patients with congestive heart failure treated with ace inhibitors
2397,ten patients on their individually titrated dose of ace inhibitors and low dose aspirin or mg daily with stable congestive heart failure from coronary artery disease entered an open investigation while on low dose aspirin which was then discontinued
2398,after one week wash out they received an oral dose of mg diclofenac potassium or placebo in a double blind cross over fashion with a one week wash out period between treatments
2399,diclofenac caused significant p decreases in gfr urine flow osmolality clearance and excretion rates of sodium and potassium compared to placebo and aspirin
2400,at t max for diclofenac or corresponding time for placebo diclofenac caused geometric mean and confidence limits reduction in gfr compared to placebo and reduction to low dose aspirin
2401,no significant changes between low dose aspirin and placebo were found
2402,acute administration of diclofenac but not long term low dose aspirin has profound impact on renal function in patients with heart failure treated with ace inhibitors and may cause worsened heart failure
2403,migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual health services and society
2404,many sufferers choose not to or are unable to seek professional help and rely on over the counter otc analgesics
2405,diclofenac is an established analgesic and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts which can be dissolved in water have been developed for rapid absorption which may be beneficial in acute migraine
2406,co therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine
2407,to determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac alone or in combination with an antiemetic compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults
2408,we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials central medline embase the oxford pain relief database clinicaltrials gov and reference lists for studies through september
2409,we included randomised double blind placebo and or active controlled studies using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode with at least participants per treatment arm
2410,two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data
2411,we used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk or risk ratio and numbers needed to treat to benefit nnt or harm nnh compared to placebo or a different active treatment
2412,five studies participants compared oral diclofenac with placebo and one also compared it with sumatriptan none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic
2413,four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response
2414,only two studies with three active treatment arms provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes
2415,for single doses of diclofenac potassium mg versus placebo two studies the nnts were and for pain free at two hours headache relief at two hours and pain free responses at hours respectively associated symptoms of nausea photophobia and phonophobia and functional disability were reduced within two hours and similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events which were mostly mild and transient there were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator oral sumatriptan mg
2416,oral diclofenac potassium mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine providing relief from pain and associated symptoms although only a minority of patients experience pain free responses
2417,adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo
2418,kv plays a crucial role in the activation and proliferation of t lymphocytes and macrophages
2419,while kv is responsible for the voltage dependent potassium current in t cells in macrophages this k current is generated by the association of kv and kv
2420,patients with autoimmune diseases show a high number of effector memory t cells that are characterized by a high expression of kv and kv antagonists ameliorate autoimmune disorders in vivo
2421,diclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid used in patients who suffer from painful autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
2422,in this study we show that diclofenac impairs immune response via a mechanism that involves kv
2423,while diclofenac inhibited kv expression in activated macrophages and t lymphocytes kv remained unaffected
2424,diclofenac also decreased inos levels in raw cells impairing their activation in response to lipopolysaccharide lps
2425,lps induced macrophage migration and il production in stimulated jurkat t cells were also blocked by pharmacological doses of diclofenac
2426,these effects were mimicked by margatoxin a specific kv inhibitor and charybdotoxin which blocks both kv and ca activated k channels k ca
2427,because kv is a very good target for autoimmune therapies the effects of diclofenac on kv are of high pharmacological relevance
2428,this paper presents a method for fast and simultaneous determination of diclofenac dcf and its common counter ions potassium sodium and diethylammonium using ce with capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection ce c d
2429,on the basis of a single electropherogram about s the proposed method allows the determination of the stoichiometry absolute quantification and evaluation of the degradation degree of the active pharmaceutical ingredient dcf
2430,a linear working range from to mol l was obtained for all analytes in an equimolar tris taps mmol l solution as the background electrolyte as well as adequate lod and mol l for k na diethylammonium and dcf respectively
2431,the proposed method was applied to the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations tablets and spray form with similar results to those achieved by hplc dcf or flame photometry k and na at a confidence level
2432,diclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid available as a potassium salt immediate release or sodium salt delayed release
2433,this review updates an earlier review published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews issue on single dose oral diclofenac for postoperative pain
2434,to assess single dose oral diclofenac for the treatment of acute postoperative pain
2435,cochrane central medline embase biological abstracts the oxford pain relief database and reference lists of articles were searched last search december
2436,randomised double blind placebo controlled clinical trials of single dose oral diclofenac sodium or potassium for acute postoperative pain in adults
2437,two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and quality and extracted data
2438,the area under the pain relief versus time curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with at least pain relief over to hours using validated equations
2439,relative benefit risk and number needed to treat to benefit nnt were calculated
2440,information on adverse events time to remedication and participants needing additional analgesia was also collected
2441,fifteen studies eight additional studies with participants more than doubled the information available at each dose
2442,overall to of participants experienced at least pain relief over to hours at any dose with diclofenac compared to to with placebo giving nnts of about for doses of mg to mg similar to earlier review no dose response was demonstrated
2443,at mg and mg nnts for diclofenac potassium to and to were significantly lower better than for diclofenac sodium to and to
2444,the median time to use of rescue medication was hours for placebo hours for diclofenac mg and hours for diclofenac mg adverse events were reported at a similar rate to placebo with no serious events
2445,oral diclofenac is an effective single dose treatment for moderate to severe postoperative pain
2446,significantly more participants experienced at least pain relief over to hours with diclofenac potassium than with diclofenac sodium
2447,there was no significant difference between diclofenac and placebo in the incidence of adverse events
2448,a quantitative analytical method for the determination of diclofenac in pharmaceutical preparations by diffuse reflectance in the visible region of the spectrum is presented
2449,the color reaction is done directly in the measuring cell immediately after mixing using small volumes of the analyte solution of the reagent and of the buffer solutions
2450,all reflectance measurements were carried out in a home made reflectometer equipped with a red led as light source and a ldr as detector
2451,the calibration curves were constructed from to mg ml about x to x mol l of sodium diclofenac or of potassium diclofenac in the analytical solution with typical correlation coefficients equal to the detection limit was estimated to be about mg ml x mol l
2452,the method was applied to determine diclofenac in solid and liquid pharmaceutical preparations
2454,varied from to depending of the sample
2455,the results were compared with those obtained with the hplc procedure recommended by the united states pharmacopoeia using the statistical student s t test procedure
2456,the activation of nitric oxide no production is an analgesic mechanism shared by drugs such as morphine and diclofenac
2457,therefore the controlled release of low amounts of no seems to be a promising analgesic approach
2458,in the present study the antinociceptive effect of the ruthenium no donor ru bpy no so pf complex i was investigated
2459,it was observed that complex i inhibited in a dose mg kg dependent manner the acetic acid induced writhing response
2460,at the dose of mg kg complex i inhibited the phenyl p benzoquinone induced writhing response and formalin and complete freund s adjuvant induced licking and flinch responses
2461,additionally complex i also inhibited transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member trpv dependent overt pain like behavior induced by capsaicin
2462,complex i also inhibited the carrageenin induced mechanical hyperalgesia and increase of myeloperoxidase activity mpo in paw skin samples
2463,the inhibitory effect of complex i in the carrageenin induced hyperalgesia mpo activity and formalin was prevented by the treatment with odq kt and glybenclamide indicating that complex i inhibits inflammatory hyperalgesia by activating the cgmp pkg atp sensitive potassium channel signaling pathway
2464,the present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel ruthenium no donor and its analgesic mechanisms
2465,although we have several acute care medications for the treatment of migraine we are always looking for new medications to treat our patients
2466,patients often say that their headaches are not under optimal control and would be happy to try another medication
2467,patients look for faster onset of relief more complete relief no recurrent headache and no adverse events
2468,this article will cover some new and some anticipated acute care products cgrp antagonists sumatriptan by iontophoretic patch sumatriptan by needle free injections dhe by oral inhalation and diclofenac potassium in a sachet
2469,botulinum toxin therapy although a preventive measure will be mentioned at the end
2470,a patient was admitted to the medical emergency department by his family physician
2471,his complaints were weakness and fatigue for more than one week
2472,four days before admission he went to his general practitioner for these complaints and also for painful elbows
2473,his physician prescribed diclofenac and esomeprazole
2474,upon presentation he had high systolic diastolic blood pressure mm hg measured repeatedly and otherwise normal parameters
2475,he had gained kg in body weight
2476,clinical examination was normal except for very mild bilateral malleolar edema
2477,routine blood tests showed a strongly elevated serum creatinine hyperkalemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase
2478,haptoglobin levels were normal
2479,urinalysis showed a normal sediment urine and blood cultures remained sterile
2480,ophthalmoscopy was completely normal as was a routine chest x ray
2481,renal ultrasound demonstrated kidneys with a diameter of cm
2482,due to uncontrollable hypertension our patient was hospitalized at the intensive care department where intravenous nifedipine was started with good instantaneous control of blood pressure
2483,because of increasing potassium levels acute hemodialysis was started within h after admission
2484,differential diagnosis consisted of diclofenac or esomeprazole induced interstitial nephritis or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
2485,a renal biopsy was performed within h after admission
2486,the kidney biopsy showed an overwhelming inflammatory cell infiltrate consisting of a monoclonal lymphocytic cell population
2487,however the numerous mitotic figures polyploidy and prominent nucleoli present were indicative of a lymphoma
2488,additional stainings confirmed a non hodgkin diffuse large cell b cell lymphoma
2489,treatment with r chop rituximab cyclophosphamide doxorubicine vincristine and prednisolone was initiated with very good clinical and biochemical response yet only mild recovery of kidney function
2490,occasionally the kidney is involved as an extranodal non hodgkin lymphoma nhl localization
2491,however a primary presentation of acute kidney failure due to lymphoma localization is extremely rare
2492,our case demonstrates that early renal biopsy is indispensable for fast and adequate diagnosis and treatment
2493,use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids is primarily limited by renal and gastrointestinal adverse effects
2494,rebamipide suppresses gastric mucosal injury when administered with nsaids
2495,this study aimed to determine rebamipide s influence upon renal effects following concomitant use with celecoxib or diclofenac
2496,on day rats were randomly divided into groups n
2497,on days and three groups received placebo and three groups were administered rebamipide mg kg twice daily
2498,on day the rats treated with placebo received another dose of placebo and ten minutes later a single dose of celecoxib mg kg diclofenac mg kg or placebo respectively
2499,the rats treated with rebamipide received one more dose of rebamipide and ten minutes later one single dose of celecoxib diclofenac or placebo respectively
2500,urine and blood samples were collected on days and sodium and potassium excretion rates decreased significantly in the rats treated with celecoxib diclofenac rebamipide plus celecoxib or rebamipide plus diclofenac on day blood urea nitrogen bun levels significantly increased in placebo plus diclofenac and rebamipide plus diclofenac groups on day comparing the two groups the levels of bun was significantly higher in the rebamipide plus diclofenac group compared to that of placebo plus diclofenac group
2501,concomitant administration of rebamipide with either nsaid caused a rise in concentrations of urinary kidney injury molecule
2502,histopathological evaluations revealed an intensified nsaid induced tubular necrosis by rebamipide
2503,based upon the results obtained concomitant administration of rebamipide with nsaids enhances the effect of nsaids on tubular injury
2504,celecoxib diclofenac ibuprofen and nimesulide are nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids very commonly used for the treatment of moderate to mild pain together with paracetamol acetaminophen a very widely used analgesic with a lesser anti inflammatory effect
2505,in the study reported here we tested the efficacy of celecoxib diclofenac and ibuprofen on preprotachykinin mrna synthesis substance p sp release prostaglandin e pge release and protein kinase c epsilon pkc translocation in rat cultured sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia drgs
2506,the efficacy of these nsaids was compared with the efficacy of paracetamol and nimesulide in in vitro models of hyperalgesia investigated previously
2507,while nimesulide and paracetamol as in previous experiments decreased the percentage of cultured drg neurons showing translocation of pkc caused by nm thrombin or m bradykinin in a dose dependent manner the other nsaids tested did not have a significant effect
2508,the amount of sp released by peptidergic neurons and the expression level of preprotachykinin mrna were assessed in basal conditions and after minutes or hours of stimulation with an inflammatory soup is containing potassium chloride thrombin bradykinin and endothelin
2509,the release of sp at minutes was inhibited only by nimesulide while celecoxib and diclofenac were effective at hours
2510,the mrna basal level of the sp precursor preprotachykinin expressed in drg neurons was reduced only by nimesulide while the increased levels expressed during treatment with the is were significantly reduced by all drugs tested with the exception of ibuprofen
2511,all drugs were able to decrease basal and is stimulated pge release
2512,our study demonstrates novel mechanisms of action of commonly used nsaids
2513,this is an updated version of the original cochrane overview published in issue that overview considered both efficacy and adverse events but adverse events are now dealt with in a separate overview thirty nine cochrane reviews of randomised trials have examined the analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain
2514,this overview brings together the results of those individual reviews and assesses the reliability of available data
2515,to summarise the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions for acute pain in adults with at least moderate pain following surgery who have been given a single dose of oral analgesic
2516,we identified systematic reviews in the cochrane database of systematic reviews in the cochrane library through a simple search strategy
2517,all reviews were overseen by a single review group had a standard title and had as their primary outcome the number of participants with at least pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo
2518,for individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome nnt for this outcome for each drug dose combination and also the percentage of participants achieving at least maximum pain relief the mean of mean or median time to remedication and the percentage of participants remedicating by six eight or hours
2519,where there was adequate information for pairs of drug and dose at least participants in at least two studies we defined the addition of four comparisons of typical size participants in total with zero effect as making the result potentially subject to publication bias and therefore unreliable
2520,the overview included separate cochrane reviews with analyses of single dose oral analgesics tested in acute postoperative pain models with results from about participants in approximately individual studies
2521,the individual reviews included only high quality trials of standardised design methods and efficacy outcome reporting
2522,no statistical comparison was undertaken reliable results high quality information were obtained for pairs of drug and dose in painful postsurgical conditions these included various fixed dose combinations and fast acting formulations of some analgesics
2523,nnts varied from about to for at least maximum pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo
2524,the proportion of participants achieving this level of benefit varied from about to over and the time to remedication varied from two hours placebo to over hours
2525,good low nnts were obtained with ibuprofen mg plus paracetamol acetaminophen mg nnt compared with placebo confidence interval to ibuprofen fast acting mg to ibuprofen mg plus caffeine mg to diclofenac potassium mg to and etoricoxib mg to
2526,for comparison ibuprofen acid mg had an nnt of to
2527,not all participants had good pain relief and for many pairs of drug and dose or more did not achieve at least maximum pain relief over four to six hours long duration of action eight hours or greater was found for etoricoxib mg diflunisal mg paracetamol mg plus oxycodone mg naproxen mg celecoxib mg and ibuprofen mg plus paracetamol mg there was no evidence of analgesic effect for aceclofenac mg aspirin mg and oxycodone mg low quality evidence
2528,no trial data were available in reviews of acemetacin meloxicam nabumetone nefopam sulindac tenoxicam and tiaprofenic acid
2529,inadequate amounts of data were available for nine drugs and doses and data potentially susceptible to publication bias for drugs and doses very low quality evidence
2530,there is a wealth of reliable evidence on the analgesic efficacy of single dose oral analgesics
2531,fast acting formulations and fixed dose combinations of analgesics can produce good and often long lasting analgesia at relatively low doses
2532,there is also important information on drugs for which there are no data inadequate data or where results are unreliable due to susceptibility to publication bias
2533,this should inform choices by professionals and consumers
2534,it has been proposed that the antinociception of systemic diclofenac is the outcome of peripheral and central actions
2535,hence our purpose was to examine if systemic diclofenac is able to achieve effective concentrations at local and spinal sites and to characterize the interaction between its local and spinal actions
2536,pain was produced in the rat using the formalin test
2537,oral diclofenac mg kg reduced formalin induced pain
2538,the antinociceptive effect of oral diclofenac mg kg was abolished by local or spinal administration of either l name microg and microg or glibenclamide microg and microg
2539,these results suggest that oral diclofenac achieves effective concentrations producing an antinociceptive effect involving participation of the no potassium channel pathway at both the local and spinal levels
2540,in an additional experimental series diclofenac was administered either locally microg or spinally microg yielding an antinociceptive effect by both routes
2541,then diclofenac was given simultaneously by these two routes in a fixed ratio and antinociception was assayed
2542,isobolographic analysis revealed an additive interaction between the local and spinal effects of diclofenac
2543,hence our results provide evidence that the overall antinociceptive effect induced by systemic diclofenac is the outcome of central and peripheral mechanisms
2544,chemically activated carbon materials prepared from pine sawdust onopordum acanthium l were studied for the removal of diclofenac and naproxen from aqueous solution
2545,several carbons using different proportions of precursors were obtained carbon c to carbon c and the chemical modification by liquid acid and basic treatments of c were carried out
2546,the textural properties of the carbons evaluated by n adsorption desorption isotherms revealed that the treatments with nitric acid and potassium hydroxide dramatically reduced the specific surface area and the pore volume of the carbon samples
2547,the surface chemistry characterization made by thermal programmed decomposition studies determination of isoelectric point and boehm s titration showed the major presence of lactone and phenol groups on the activated carbons surface being higher the content when the acidic strength of the carbon increased
2548,diclofenac and naproxen kinetic data onto c carbon followed pseudo second order model
2549,the adsorption equilibrium isotherms of c and the modified carbons were well described by both sips and gab isotherm equations
2550,the highest adsorption capacity was found for naproxen onto c activated carbon mg g since the liquid acid and basic functionalization of the carbon led to a severe decreasing in the adsorption removal of the target compounds
2551,the bioavailability of a single dose of a potassium diclofenac kdic suspension flogan merck ml mg was studied in healthy male volunteers in the fasting state placebo phase pla after gastric acid secretion blockade subacute pretreatment with omeprazole ome phase and after food intake food phase
2552,a day washout period between phases was adopted
2553,serum samples were obtained over a hour interval and the diclofenac concentrations were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection
2554,from the serum diclofenac concentration vs time curves the auc infinity area under the concentration vs time curves from to infinity cmax maximum achieved concentration tmax time to achieve cmax ke terminal first order elimination constant half life values t and auc infinity t ratio as an index of diclofenac clearance were obtained
2555,all these variables were analyzed using both parametric and non parametric statistics
2556,in the presence of food kdic absorption was delayed as shown by lower cmax and greater tmax values and decreased as shown by lower auc infinity values and the serum diclofenac concentration vs time curves showed a biphasic pattern
2557,omeprazole pretreatment did not change the absorption parameters
2558,both of these treatments altered the diclofenac clearance as assessed by the auc infinity t t and ke values although the changes were not considered to be clinically significant because of the wide therapeutic range for diclofenac
2559,the delay in the rate of diclofenac absorption produced by food intake was not due to an increase in the gastric ph and could be of particular importance when rapid analgesia is desired
2560,the bioavailability of two suspension formulations of potassium diclofenac flogan merck and cataflam ciba geigy were compared in eighteen healthy male volunteers who received a single dose of ml of each suspension equivalent to mg of potassium diclofenac in an open randomized two period crossover design with a fourteen day washout period between doses
2561,serum samples were obtained over a hour interval and diclofenac concentrations were determined by hplc with ultraviolet detection
2562,from the serum diclofenac concentration vs time curves auc area under the concentration vs time curves from h cmax maximum achieved concentration tmax time to achieve cmax and ke terminal first order elimination constant were obtained
2563,overlapping of tmax intervals for both formulations was observed but the important inter subject variation observed in cmax ratios did not allow equivalence conclusion for the rate of absorption
2564,equivalence in the extent of bioavailability between both potassium diclofenac suspension brands was concluded from the analysis of auc ratios
2565,a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection for the quantitative determination of diclofenac potassium in plasma was developed
2566,naproxen was used as the internal standard
2567,the drug and internal standard were isolated from plasma by extraction with dichloromethane and m hydrochloric acid
2568,chromatographic separation was performed on a c column with methanol water v v adjusted to ph with phosphoric acid as mobile phase
2569,the oxidation potential for detection was established by constructing a voltammogram for diclofenac
2570,the quantification limit for diclofenac in plasma was ng ml
2571,linearity of the method was confirmed in the range ng ml correlation coefficient within day relative standard deviations rsds ranged from to and between day rsds from to
2572,the method was successfully applied for the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters after ingestion of a mg dose of diclofenac
2573,studies were performed on healthy volunteers of both sexes
2574,this study was a trial to demonstrate the prophylactic effect of diclofenac a widely used anti inflammatory drug diclofenac potassium cas ciba geigy in experimental schistosomiasis mansoni
2575,two different dose regimens were used to explore the effects upon worm load tissue egg load and hepatic granuloma size
2576,in this study a group of swiss albino mice was used
2577,this group was divided into five subgroups subgroup i constituted infected untreated control mice subgroup ii infected mice given mg diclofenac orally h post infection then sacrificed three weeks later subgroup iii infected mice given mg diclofenac orally six weeks post infection and sacrificed one week later subgroup iv infected mice administered mg diclofenac orally h post infection and sacrificed three weeks later and subgroup v infected mice given mg of the drug orally six weeks post infection and sacrificed one week later
2578,mice given the high dose regimen mg orally mouse h post infection then sacrificed three weeks later demonstrated a significant reduction in the immature worms recovered compared to the untreated controls
2579,animals receiving the high dose of the drug six weeks post infection then sacrificed one week later revealed a drop in the number of mature worms and in the tissue egg load hepatic and intestinal and the smallest hepatic granuloma measurement compared to the untreated controls
2580,these findings were less conspicuous in animals given the low dose regimen
2581,diclofenac could be used successfully as a preventive agent against schistosomiasis mansoni infection in endemic areas
2582,design of biorelevant test setups mimicking the physiological conditions experienced by drugs after oral administration along the passage through the mouth and the gi tract for the in vitro evaluation of diclofenac exhibiting multiple peak phenomenon during absorption
2583,the biorelevant models simulated successively saliva ssf ph ml min gastric sgf fassgf ph ml min and intestinal fassif ph ml min fluids
2584,applying these models diclofenac free acid and its sodium potassium salt were comparatively evaluated for dissolution and further characterized by hplc optical morphogranulometry dsc and pxrd to elucidate peculiar behaviors
2585,diclofenac salts almost completely dissolved in ssf and showed a transitional dissolution pattern before complete precipitation in sgf fassgf
2586,this peculiar pattern correlated with simultaneous chemical modification and formation of agglomerates
2587,with low dissolution in ssf and almost immediately complete precipitation these behaviors were not observed with diclofenac free acid
2588,distinct diclofenac features were strongly determined by ph modifications after oral administration
2589,the multiple peak phenomenon observed after administrating a solution suspension or dispersible formulation of diclofenac salts are likely caused by drug precipitation and agglomeration in the stomach leading to irregular gastric emptying
2590,diclofenac free acid may provide more reliable in vivo features
2591,old headache medicines never die they either fade away or come back in disguise
2592,the disguise is often a new route of administration which may work better faster more completely with fewer adverse events and or have certain other advantages
2593,the clinical aspects of of the oldest headache medicines ergotamine tartrate dihydroergotamine and methysergide will be discussed here
2594,sumatriptan will then be discussed as the prototype of the newest category of acute care therapy triptans for migraine
2595,it will be compared with the older medications and the new forms being developed will be briefly discussed
2596,diclofenac potassium for oral solution will be mentioned as the newest drug approved for migraine by the food and drug administration and a possible alternative to triptans in patients with frequent headaches or those with contraindications to vasoconstrictors
2597,pain control is an important concern in limb trauma
2598,the most ideal agent for this purpose varies among different hospitals
2599,the objective of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of oral diclofenac potassium versus intravenous acetaminophen in patients with limb trauma
2600,this was a double blind randomized clinical trial conducted on adult patients
2601,oral diclofenac potassium mg was given in group d and intravenous acetaminophen g in ml normal saline over min was administered in group a patients pain scores visual analogue scale were recorded and compared at baseline min and hr after drug administration
2602,the mean age was and years in group a and group d respectively
2603,no significant change was observed between the groups p
2604,in this study both drugs could decrease the pain score effectively and safely in isolated limb trauma
2605,in an open triple crossover study in patients with essential hypertension the possibility has been investigated of whether the blood pressure lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide mg once daily was attenuated by co administration for weeks of ibuprofen mg t i d diclofenac mg t i d
2606,or sulindac mg b i d
2607,only a slight statistically nonsignificant change was found with the exception of a significant increase in systolic blood pressure after weeks treatment with ibuprofen
2608,there was considerable variation in the blood pressure response during treatment with all three nsaids with slight rises in blood pressure in out of periods
2609,body weight increased significantly on treatment both with ibuprofen and diclofenac whereas the increase on sulindac was less and was transient
2610,no significant change was found in various biochemical parameters including plasma electrolytes plasma renin activity pra aldosterone albumin and creatinine in haematocrit or in the h urinary excretion of sodium and potassium
2611,the sole exception was a decrease in pra during ibuprofen treatment
2612,from these observations it is concluded that ibuprofen and diclofenac differ from sulindac in their interaction with the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide
2613,it appears that all three nsaids can safely be combined with hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients but blood pressure should be monitored carefully when an nsaid are added
2614,drug drug interactions between non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis angiotensin receptor blocker arbs or diuretics can lead to renal failure and hyperkalemia
2615,thus monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium is recommended when a first dispensing of nsaid occur in patients treated with these drugs
2616,we conducted a pharmacoepidemiological retrospective cohort study using data from the french health insurance reimbursement database to evaluate the proportion of serum creatinine and potassium laboratory monitoring in patients treated with acei arb or diuretic and receiving a first dispensing of nsaid
2617,we described the first dispensing of nsaid among patients of a year cohort patients treated with antihypertensive drugs and analyzed serum creatinine and potassium laboratory monitoring within the weeks after the first nsaid dispensing
2618,general practitioners were the most frequent prescribers of nsaids ci
2619,the more commonly prescribed nsaids were ibuprofen ketoprofen diclofenac and piroxicam
2620,serum creatinine and potassium monitoring was ci in patients treated by aceis arbs or diuretics
2621,overall monitoring was more frequently performed to women aged over treated with digoxin or glucose lowering drugs but not to patients treated with aceis arbs or diuretics
2622,monitoring was more frequent when nsaids prescribers were cardiologists or anesthesiologists
2623,monitoring of serum creatinine and potassium of patients treated with aceis arbs or diuretics and receiving a first nsaid dispensing is insufficiently performed and needs to be reinforced through specific interventions
2624,the objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of preemptive oral administration of single dose of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and acetaminophen on the local anesthetic success in adults with irreversible pulpitis and to find the possible covariates that could predict treatment effect
2625,a systematic search using electronic databases up to march was conducted
2626,odds ratio or and confidence intervals cis were estimated using random and fixed effect inverse variance method
2627,subgroup and meta regression analyses were conducted to assess the potential source of heterogeneity
2628,results showed that preemptive analgesics are more effective than placebo in increasing anesthetic success or ci p q p
2629,in the subgroup analysis administration of nsaids as monotherapy ibuprofen as mono vs combination therapy oxicam type drugs as monotherapy and acetaminophen as combination therapy were significantly more effective in increasing anesthetic success or ci p q p or ci p q p or ci p q p or ci p q p or ci p q p respectively
2630,however there was no significant difference in increasing anesthetic success between treatment and placebo arms when acetaminophen was administrated alone
2631,in meta regression analysis an association between different types of nsaids indomethacin diclofenac potassium and oxicam type drugs and articaine with treatment effect was observed
2632,the administration of preemptive analgesics can induce superior intraoperative analgesia for patients with irreversible pulpitis
2633,however strategies such as co administration of certain types of analgesics and anesthetic solution might be predictors of treatment effect
2634,additionally there was no association between different timing and dosage of analgesics and treatment effect
2635,when compared to placebo preemptive oral analgesics are superior in achieving anesthetic success in inflamed pulp
2636,there are many categories and individual types of headache and most have a variety of treatment protocols while a few are best treated by just one medication
2637,this paper will concentrate on acute care medications for migraine and discuss some new and future acute care treatments
2638,there is not much to discuss about prevention except that onabotulinumtoxina has been approved for prevention of chronic migraine
2639,cluster headache will also be discussed as there are some future treatments for acute care and prevention being studied at present
2640,for the acute care of migraine in the us we have seven triptans by tablet plus other routes and one non steroidal anti inflammatory medication approved by the fda that is currently available cambia brand of buffered diclofenac potassium for oral solution
2641,there are several other acute care medications in various stages of development and there are three new methods of administering a triptan and others under investigation
2642,the optimal acute care therapy for migraine should be faster easier to use and more efficient with fewer adverse events than what is currently available
2643,what follows is a brief review of the status in development for five of the many new acute care medications being investigated the cgrp antagonist tablet telcagepant the sumatriptan iontophoretic patch zelrix sumatriptan powder for use in the optinose apparatus dihydroergotamine for oral inhalation levadex civamide nasal solution for prevention of episodic cluster headache civanex and sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation for acute cluster attacks in chronic cluster headaches
2644,other future treatments that will not be discussed include transcranial magnetic stimulation a ht f agonist named alniditan large conductance calcium activated potassium channel openers glial modulators or other medications and devices in early stages of development
2645,abstract since three new analgesic entities tapentadol immediate release nucynta diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules zipsor and bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension exparel were granted us food and drug administration fda approval to treat acute pain
2646,tapentadol immediate release is a both a mu opioid agonist and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain
2647,diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules are a novel formulation of diclofenac potassium which is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and its putative mechanism of action is through inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes
2648,this novel formulation of diclofenac allows for improved absorption at lower doses
2649,liposomal bupivacaine is a new formulation of bupivacaine intended for single dose infiltration at the surgical site for postoperative analgesia
2650,bupivacaine is slowly released from this liposomal vehicle and can provide prolonged analgesia at the surgical site
2651,by utilizing nsaids and local anesthetics to decrease the transmission of afferent pain signals less opioid analgesics are needed to achieve analgesia
2652,since drug related adverse events are frequently dose related lower doses from different drug classes may be employed to reduce the incidence of adverse effects while producing synergistic analgesia as part of a multimodal analgesic approach to acute pain
2653,the aim of this study was to develop a novel double layer bi medicated prolonged release mucoadhesive buccal film mbf containing lidocaine hydrochloride lc and diclofenac potassium dk
2654,the ultimate goal of the prepared system is the treatment of radiation induced oral mucositis pain with improved patient acceptance
2655,mbfs were prepared using
2656,the in vitro permeation of three diclofenac salts diclofenac sodium dfs diclofenac potassium dfp and diclofenac diethylammonium dfd across skin by both passive and iontophoretic transport were investigated
2657,various skin types were used as the barriers to elucidate the mechanism controlling transdermal delivery of diclofenac salts
2658,the importance of the intercellular paracellular route for both dfs and dfp in passive permeation was elucidated
2659,the transfollicular route constitutes an important permeation pathway for dfs but not for dfp
2660,the route and mechanism for transdermal iontophoresis of dfd across the skin was somewhat different to that of the other salts
2661,hair follicles may be a more important pathway for dfd than for dfs and dfp under iontophoresis while the intercellular lipid pathway showed the opposite result
2662,combination of iontophoresis and a penetration enhancer cardamom oil did not show a synergistic effect on diclofenac salt permeation
2663,the results of this investigation suggest that the transdermal mechanism and the route of diclofenac salt uptake via passive and iontophoretic transport can be affected by their counterions
2664,potassium permanganate is a strong oxidant widely used in drinking water treatment that can react with organic micropollutants
2665,thus the oxidation kinetics and transformation route of seven non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids upon reaction with potassium permanganate was investigated
2666,a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms system was used to follow the time course of pharmaceuticals concentrations and for the identification of their by products
2667,under strong oxidation conditions mg l kmno h only two nsaids were significantly degraded indomethacine and diclofenac
2668,the degradation kinetics of these two drugs was investigated at different concentrations of permanganate chlorides phosphates and sample ph by means of a full factorial experimental design
2669,depending on these factors half lives were in the range h for indomethacine and h for diclofenac equivalent to apparent second order constants between and m s and and m s respectively
2670,permanganate concentration was the most significant factor on nsaids oxidation kinetics but the ph also played a significant role in diclofenac reaction being faster at acidic ph
2671,in the case of indomethacine the dose of permanganate seemed also to play an autocatalytic effect
2672,the use of an accurate mass high resolution lc q tof ms system permitted the identification of a total of by products
2673,the transformation path of these drugs consisted mainly of hydroxylations decarboxylations and oxidation of aromatic double bonds with ring opening
2674,the software predicted toxicity of these products indicates that they are expected not to be more toxic than the nsaids with the exception of two indomethacine by products
2675,reaction in real samples was slower and or incomplete for both pharmaceuticals depending on the organic matter content of the sample
2676,however still all transformation products could be detected for indomethacine in permanganate treated surface water samples and two out of five in the case of diclofenac
2677,the use of topical non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac for the treatment of temporomandibular disorders related myofascial pain is based on the premise that their analgesic effect is mediated by a local action on the excitability of muscle nociceptors despite a lack of muscle inflammation in these patients
2678,to investigate if diclofenac has an effect on muscle afferent fibers in the absence of inflammation in vivo recordings of the response of masseter muscle afferent fibers to mechanical and noxious chemical hypertonic saline stimulation were made in anesthetized sprague dawley rats
2679,it was observed that injection of diclofenac or mg ml alone could elevate afferent mechanical threshold for a min period post injection
2680,hypertonic saline evoked afferent discharge was also significantly attenuated by the higher concentration of diclofenac and lidocaine mg ml but not by the lower concentration of diclofenac
2681,additional experiments were undertaken to investigate whether activation of atp sensitive potassium k atp channels could contribute to the effects of diclofenac
2682,the k atp channel opener pinacidil mg ml significantly enhanced potassium chloride evoked afferent discharge consistent with the concept that masseter afferent fibers have functional k atp channels however subsequent experiments indicated that diclofenac mg ml significantly suppressed potassium chloride evoked afferent discharge and that pinacidil did not affect hypertonic saline evoked afferent discharge
2683,these results indicate that diclofenac can exert a local anesthetic like action on masseter afferent fibers in the absence of inflammation but that this effect does not appear to involve the opening of k atp channels
2684,in this paper we examined feasible correlations between the structure of different lyotropic mesophases and transdermal administration of three diclofenac derivatives with varying degrees of kosmotropic or chaotropic properties solubilized within the mesophases
2685,it was found that the most chaotropic derivative of diclofenac diethyl amine dea dfc interacted with the polar heads of glycerol monooleate gmo thus expanding the water lipid interface of the lamellar and cubic mesophases
2686,this effect was detected by an increase in the lattice parameter of both mesophases enhanced elastic properties and increased solid like response of the systems in the presence of dea
2687,potassium diclofenac k dfc a less chaotropic salt had less pronounced effect on the structural features of the mesophases
2688,kosmotropic na salt na dfc had only minor influence on both lamellar and cubic structures
2689,the locus of solubilization of the molecules with the host mesophases was correlated with their delivery
2690,it was suggested that transdermal delivery of kosmotropic na dfc was accelerated by the aqueous phase and less constrained by the interaction with monoglyceride
2691,on the other hand the chaotropic cations k and dea presumably entrapped in the water lipid interface interacted with monoglyceride headgroups which is likely to be the key cause for their sustained administration
2692,since patients who regularly take nsaids may use sucralfate because of its cytoprotective properties we examined the influence of this compound on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac
2693,potassium diclofenac mg was administered orally to eighteen healthy male volunteers with or without a day pre treatment with sucralfate mg twice daily
2694,blood samples were collected at intervals post dose and serum concentrations of diclofenac were determined by reverse phase h p l c
2695,pre treatment with sucralfate significantly decreased both the auc h ng h ml geometric mean range vs ng h ml and the cmax ng ml geometric mean range ng ml with no significant delay in absorption tmax h median range vs h
2696,the short term treatment of healthy male volunteers with sucralfate decreases potassium diclofenac bioavailability
2697,these findings suggest that either an appropriate increase in the diclofenac intake or the use of another gastric mucosa protector must be adopted
2698,potassium diclofenac is a potent nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and cox isoforms cox and cox inhibitor
2699,quantitative analysis of birefringence with polarized light microscopy is a useful method to investigate the macromolecular orientation and organization of collagen fibers in connective tissues
2700,the aim of this research was to analyze the collagen structure and maturation in bone formed after potassium diclofenac administration during first molar orthodontic movement
2701,sixty wistar rats were divided in two equal groups n control c and potassium diclofenac pd
2702,the animals in group c received saline solution and the pd group received potassium diclofenac cataflam mg kg
2703,animals were sacrificed or days after a niti unilateral closed coil spring was stretched between the upper right first molar and the incisors
2704,the first molar area was fixed decalcified and histologically processed using picrosirius pigment
2705,the collagen birefringence of bone turnover was analyzed by phase retardation
2706,two way anova and tukey s test showed that optical retardation was influenced by time and treatment
2707,there was increase in the collagen organization over time
2708,on the third day the c group showed better collagen organization than the pd group
2709,potassium diclofenac interfered in collagen maturation reducing fibril organization in the initial phase of orthodontic movement
2710,diclofenac a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid has been widely investigated in terms of its pharmacological action but less is known about its direct effect on ion channels
2711,here the effect of diclofenac on voltage dependent transient outward k currents i a in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells was investigated using the whole cell voltage clamp technique
2712,at concentrations of m diclofenac reversibly increased the i a amplitude in a dose dependent manner and significantly modulated the steady state inactivation properties of the i a channels but did not alter the steady state activation properties
2713,furthermore diclofenac treatment resulted in a slightly accelerated recovery from i a channel inactivation
2714,intracellular application of diclofenac could mimic the effects induced by extracellular application although once the intracellular response reached a plateau extracellular application of diclofenac could induce further increases in the current
2715,these observations indicate that diclofenac might exert its effects on the channel protein at both the inner and outer sides of the cell membrane
2716,our data provide the first evidence that diclofenac is able to activate transient outward potassium channels in neurons
2717,although further work will be necessary to define the exact mechanism of diclofenac induced i a channel activation this study provides evidence that the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac may play a novel neuronal role that is worthy of future study
2718,to determine the effect of administration of pre operative lornoxicam lnx or diclofenac potassium dp on the success of inferior alveolar nerve blocks ianb in patients with irreversible pulpitis in a double blind randomised controlled trial
2719,one hundred and fourteen patients with irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular posterior tooth participated
2720,patients indicated their pain scores on a heft parker visual analogue scale after which they were randomly divided into three groups n
2721,the subjects received identical capsules containing mg lnx mg dp or cellulose powder placebo plac h before administration of ianb with lidocaine containing epinephrine
2722,lip numbness was assessed after min following which the teeth were tested with cold spray and their responses negative or positive were recorded
2723,access cavities were then prepared and success of ianb was defined as the absence of pain during access preparation and root canal instrumentation
2724,the data were analysed using chi squared tests
2725,the percentages of teeth giving a negative response to cold test were plac lnx and dp with no significant differences amongst the groups p
2726,the success rates for the ianb in descending order were lnx dp and plac
2727,a significant p difference was found between the lnx and the plac groups only
2728,pre operative administration of lnx significantly improved the efficacy of ianb in patients with irreversible pulpitis whilst the effect of pre medication with dp was not significantly different from the plac
2729,the aim of this study is to explore non steroid anti inflammation drugs nsaids potency for pelvic floor muscle pain by measuring local concentration in a rat model
2730,we used nine nsaids including nabumetone naproxen ibuprofen meloxicam piroxicam diclofenac potassium etodolac indomethacin and sulindac and groups of female wister rats
2731,each group of rats was fed with one kind of nsaid mg ml for three consecutive days
2732,thereafter one ml of blood and one gram of pelvic floor muscle were taken to measure drug pharmacokinetics including partition coefficient lipophilicity elimination of half life t and muscle plasma converting ratio css muscle css plasma
2733,diclofenac potassium had the lowest t and the highest mean css muscle css plasma hours and respectively
2734,the mean css muscle css plasma of sulindac naproxen and ibuprofen were lower than other experimental nsaids
2735,diclofenac potassium had the highest disposition in pelvic floor muscle in a rat model
2736,the finding implies that diclofenac potassium might be the choice for pain relief in pelvic muscle
2737,the potential protective effects of taurine and quercetin against gentamycin gm diclofenac dc combined nephrotoxicity were investigated in rats
2738,the results showed that administration of dc alone at an oral dose of mg kg b wt day for days had no significant effect on the measured parameters except for marked increase in urinary uronic acid excretion
2739,administration of gm alone at a dose of mg kg b wt day i p
2740,for days resulted in obvious nephrotoxicity
2741,combined gm dc treatment led to the most pronounced nephrotoxicity as indicated by greater elevations in serum urea creatinine and urinary n acetyl beta d glucosaminidase nag together with severe depression of renal cortical na k atpase compared to gm treated group
2742,moreover only combined treatment resulted in significant decrease in urinary potassium and renal cortical glutathione peroxidase gshpx together with an increase in renal cortical lipid peroxidation products lpos
2743,co administration of taurine or quercetin normalized creatinine clearance and ameliorated the elevations in urinary proteins uronic acids nag and renal cortical lpos in gm dc treated rats
2744,the study justifies the use of taurine and quercetin as renoprotective agents against the nephrotoxicity caused by gm dc therapy
2745,we have examined the effect of diclofenac on renal function after major surgery in a randomized double blind controlled study of patients undergoing oesophagogastrectomy
2746,diclofenac mg or placebo was given i m
2749,fluid administration was standardized
2750,renal function was assessed by fluid balance and measurement of serum creatinine and electrolyte concentrations creatinine and free water clearance and urinary sodium and potassium excretion
2751,urinary keto prostaglandin f alpha keto pgf alpha was measured by radioimmunoassay to assess renal prostacyclin production
2752,after surgery keto pgf alpha production increased but this did not occur with diclofenac
2753,on the first day after surgery use of diclofenac was associated with a decreased urine flow rate decreased urinary sodium and potassium excretion and a tendency to hyperkalaemia
2754,frusemide was required more often in the diclofenac group
2755,one patient was withdrawn from the diclofenac group because of impaired renal function
2756,urine flow rate and blood potassium concentration should be monitored if diclofenac is used after major surgery
2757,a novel series of thienopyrimidine derivatives bearing various substituents or linked to various heterocyclic moieties through atoms spacers were prepared starting from methyl oxo dihydrothieno d pyrimidine carboxamide potassium salt twelve out of the prepared compounds were selected and evaluated for their antiinflammatory activity using the formalin induced paw edema and the turpentine oil induced granuloma pouch bioassays using diclofenac sodium as a reference standard
2758,the ulcerogenic effects and acute toxicity ald values of these compounds were also determined
2759,in addition the analgesic activity of the same compounds was evaluated using the rat tail withdrawal technique
2760,the results revealed that compounds a b a a and b had high anti inflammatory effect comparable to diclofenac sodium whereas compounds a a a and a revealed pronounced analgesic activity that is equal or higher than that of the reference
2761,all of the tested compounds revealed high gi safety profile and were well tolerated by the experimental animals with high safety margin ald g kg
2762,carboxylesterases hydrolyze esters amides and thioesters to produce carboxylic acids and resulting alcohols amines and thiols respectively
2763,uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases are colocalized with carboxylesterases and have the potential to further metabolize carboxylic acids to acyl glucuronides but it is currently unknown if acyl glucuronides being esters also interact with carboxylesterases
2764,this study explores the ability of acyl glucuronides to act as substrates or inhibitors of human carboxylesterases hces and hces
2765,the stability of six acyl glucuronides in the presence of hces hces and buffer alone mm potassium phosphate ph c were investigated
2766,reversible inhibition of nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis by the acyl glucuronides was also studied
2767,diclofenac d glucuronide was used to explore potential time dependent inactivation
2768,the chemical stability half life values for cgp d glucuronide diclofenac d glucuronide r naproxen d glucuronide s naproxen d glucuronide ibuprofen d glucuronide racemic clopidogrel d glucuronide and valproate d glucuronide were found to be and hours respectively
2769,diclofenac d glucuronide clopidogrel d glucuronide ibuprofen d glucuronide r naproxen d glucuronide and s naproxen d glucuronide selectively inhibited hces with ki values of m respectively but did not significantly inhibit hces
2770,valproate d glucuronide and cgp d glucuronide did not inhibit either hces
2771,time dependent inactivation of hces by diclofenac d glucuronide was not observed
2772,lastly both hces and hces were shown not to catalyze the hydrolysis of the acyl glucuronides studied
2773,drug drug interaction studies may be warranted for drugs that metabolize to acyl glucuronides due to the potential inhibition of hcess
2774,diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules dpsgc are a low dose liquid filled formulation that uses patented dispersion technology to facilitate rapid and consistent gastrointestinal absorption
2775,onset of pain relief experienced by patients receiving dpsgc was evaluated in two dental pain studies
2776,confirmed perceptible pain relief was evaluated in a post hoc analysis from these randomized controlled trials
2777,adult patients n were enrolled in two multicenter parallel group double blind placebo controlled studies
2778,patients undergoing third molar extraction and experiencing a requisite level of pain mm on a mm visual analog scale within hours post surgery were randomized to receive single doses of dpsgc mg mg mg or placebo
2779,pain was assessed at baseline and during hours after dosing
2780,times to onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief were recorded using the two stopwatch method
2781,confirmed perceptible pain relief was determined in the dpsgc and placebo groups by calculating the median time to onset of perceptible pain relief first stopwatch in only those individuals who reported meaningful pain relief second stopwatch
2782,more than of patients achieved confirmed perceptible pain relief in the dpsgc groups compared with less than of patients in the placebo group study and study p
2783,the median time to onset of confirmed perceptible pain relief in the two studies was less than minutes for patients receiving any dose of dpsgc and more than minutes in the placebo group study and study p
2784,dpsgc was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported
2785,study design limitations include the short duration of the trial and evaluation of a relatively limited patient population
2786,these results indicate that dpsgc was efficacious in providing a rapid onset of confirmed perceptible pain relief within minutes of administration in these single dose postoperative dental pain studies
2787,no studies have been conducted on rational drug use among children in uzbekistan
2788,this study aimed to analyze drug uses based on pharmaco epidemiologic pe data from regional children s multi profile medical centre rcmpmc in andijan uzbekistan
2789,our study assessed drug usage in children with cardiovascular cv diseases without intervening in the treatment processes or in the course of the diseases
2790,subjects were children aged to months median age months inter quartile range months who were hospitalized in the department of cardiology and rheumatology in rcmpmc from january to december and were prescribed one or more drugs during hospitalization
2791,drugs used for a different disease or medical condition given in a different way and or given in a different dose were analyzed and considered to be irrational drugs
2792,the most commonly used medications among drug groups prescribed by the doctors of rcmpmc were as follows anti arrhythmic aspartic acid glycosides digoxin diuretics furosemide vitamins ascorbic acid steroid anti inflammatory drugs prednisolone non steroid anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac antibiotics amoxicillin non steroid anabolic drugs potassium orotas and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril
2793,the study found that irrational drug schemes were quite frequent among pediatric cv patients and they are most frequent in children aged years and younger
2794,to achieve patient compliance organoleptic aspects of drug substances play a key role in the development of oral pharmaceutical preparations
2795,in this study the ability of an electronic tongue to help in selecting a drug candidate and rationalize the development of oral taste masked formulations was evaluated
2796,as drug diclofenac in the form of acid sodium salt and potassium salt was used
2797,the taste sensing system insent ts z was capable of differentiating diclofenac acid from its salts and also distinguishing sodium and potassium salts eliciting similar taste modalities
2798,differences between qualities and intensities of sensor responses were mainly attributed to the different cations
2799,fewer taste and aftertaste stimuli were recorded for diclofenac acid
2800,based on this screening the acid form was selected to formulate different diclofenac oral taste masked preparations further evaluated using electronic tongue data by comparing formulation prototypes against corresponding placebos
2801,output information demonstrated the ability of the taste sensors to detect and discriminate different formulation concepts and taste masking strategies
2802,comparative dissolution studies showed insufficient discrimination of formulation prototypes
2803,supported by these results the electronic tongue proved to be a valuable additional tool for assessing and predicting the taste of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the early development stage
2804,we report an adult case of asymptomatic bartter s syndrome with the first presentation of hypokalemic paralysis triggered by gentamicin injection
2805,marked hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia associated with excessive kaliuresis and magnesiuria were found
2806,plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration were high but blood pressure was normal
2807,renal biopsy revealed hypercellularity of the renin producing cell of the juxtaglomerular apparatus
2808,muscular paralysis subsided after potassium chloride supplementation
2809,hypokalemia was corrected with potassium and magnesium supplements and the use of diclofenac
2810,to the best of our knowledge there have been no reports of muscular paralysis associated with gentamicin in bartter s syndrome
2811,the ex vivo permeation of diclofenac was studied using four different salts sodium potassium diethylamine and epolamine dissolved in four different solvents water propylene glycol pg transcutol and oleic acid oa as donor phases through a human skin membrane
2812,the four salts show different solubility values and different behavior in the four solvents which are also permeation enhancers and this fact further is connected to the permeation results
2813,the same order of magnitude of fluxes through the membrane as those previously reported for acidic diclofenac released from buffer solutions of ph were found taking into account differences originated by different membranes and other parameters tested in the experiments
2814,saturation concentration for the four salts in different solvents necessary to calculate permeation coefficients was critically evaluated a short discussion made it possible to explain that corrections in the solubility values must be considered related to the complex behavior in solution of these salts
2815,statistical processing of the experimental data suggests that differences between the four salts in promoting absorption of the drug is unproven while differences are evident between the solvents water is the most effective enhancing vehicle
2816,aqueous formulations containing diclofenac salt with an organic base appear to be the best combination to promote permeation in topical applications
2817,to determine associations between herbal and dietary supplement hds use and the progression of chronic kidney disease ckd and associations of hds with uncontrolled hyperphosphataemia in patients with ckd
2818,the cohort study recruited thai outpatients with stage ckd from two kidney clinics of which were followed up over months
2819,patients receiving renal replacement therapy prior to recruitment were excluded
2820,participants were interviewed regarding their hds use dietary intake and conventional medication adherence using a questionnaire
2821,the primary outcome was a composite of a decline of at least ml min per m
2822,despite no association between hds and the progression of ckd over a one year period adjusted odds ratio or confidence interval ci two patients had acute kidney injury which may be related to an unknown chinese herbal medicine or river spiderwort combined with diclofenac reported in the medical notes
2823,the use of hds was associated with uncontrolled hyperphosphataemia adjusted or ci
2824,the findings suggest that hds are likely to be related to acute kidney injury rather than the progression of ckd in thai patients with ckd
2825,the products were associated with uncontrolled hyperphosphataemia
2826,patients who have ckd and use hds should be closely monitored regarding their kidney function and electrolytes
2827,in an open multicentre study patients presenting with traumatic joint distortions predominantly involving the ankle were recruited for treatment with mg diclofenac potassium given orally three times daily for days
2828,due to various protocol violations the number of patients eligible for efficacy and tolerability analysis were and respectively
2829,significant p less than improvement in mobility swelling local tenderness functional impairment and pain intensity occurred after both and days of therapy
2830,overall efficacy was assessed as excellent good in and of cases by the investigator and patient respectively
2831,altogether patients complained of adverse effects which were generally mild or moderate in severity
2832,gastrointestinal complaints accounted for around of the reported side effects
2833,premature discontinuation of therapy due to poor tolerability was necessary in patients
2834,in conclusion diclofenac potassium was both effective and well tolerated when used for the short term treatment of traumatic joint distortions
2835,postmarketing surveillance of prescription medicines is a routine practice yet similar evaluation of non prescription medicines including those recently switched from prescription status is uncommon
2836,this study presents the methodologic issues and limitations of the use of pharmacies in the post reclassification surveillance of oral diclofenac potassium mg which had been recently switched from physician prescription to non prescription sale
2837,consenting user purchasers were recruited from new zealand pharmacies over months
2838,purchasers were mailed a questionnaire for completion days post purchase
2839,those purchasers who met criteria for being potentially at risk of adverse events were re surveyed days post purchase
2840,a descriptive analysis was carried out using t test and chi square as appropriate
2841,these results were compared to those from other types of studies in this area
2842,the recruited purchasers returned valid questionnaires response
2843,of these met at risk criteria and received the second questionnaire with valid returns response
2844,useful data was gathered on the real life usage of a medicine recently reclassified from prescription to non prescription sale
2845,the use of community pharmacies as recruiting centres was found to be effective

2850,gastroprotective agents are recommended for patients receiving low dose aspirin lda or nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
2851,vonoprazan is a potassium competitive acid blocker recently approved for the prevention of peptic ulcer recurrence in patients receiving lda or nsaids
2852,this phase open label single center study in healthy japanese males evaluated drug drug interactions between vonoprazan mg and lda mg or nsaids loxoprofen sodium mg diclofenac sodium mg or meloxicam mg and vice versa
2853,subjects were allocated to one of eight cohorts and received their orally administered treatment regimen to assess the effect of vonoprazan vs nsaid or lda or vice versa once daily
2854,endpoints were the pharmacokinetics of plasma concentrations of the study drugs alone and in combination primary safety secondary and vonoprazan effects on aspirin mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation
2855,of subjects screened were assigned to one of eight cohorts n per cohort and received treatment one subject discontinued due to a treatment emergent adverse event teae and completed the study
2856,there were few differences in the pharmacokinetics of vonoprazan when administered with lda or nsaids and few differences in the pharmacokinetics of lda or nsaids when administered with vonoprazan
2857,the differences were small and not clinically meaningful
2858,inhibition of arachidonic induced platelet aggregation by lda was not influenced by vonoprazan
2859,six patients experienced a teae all were mild and were deemed unrelated to study drugs
2860,one subject withdrew due to infection tonsillitis
2861,no clinically meaningful drug drug interactions were observed and vonoprazan was well tolerated when administered with lda or nsaids
2863,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc is a rapidly absorbed formulation of diclofenac approved for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain in adults years of age
2864,the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of dpsgc mg in a multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled study in patients experiencing pain following first metatarsal bunionectomy
2865,patients experiencing a requisite level of pain based on an point numeric pain rating scale nprs no pain worst pain possible on the day following surgery were randomized to receive dpsgc mg or placebo
2866,patients received a second dose remedication on request or at hours postdose followed by additional doses every hours through the end of postsurgery day rescue medication hydrocodone acetaminophen was available as needed after the second dose
2868,the primary efficacy endpoint was the average nprs score over the hour inpatient multiple dose period
2869,dpsgc provided a significant improvement in mean hour nprs scores over placebo vs respectively p as well as for summed pain intensity difference vs p
2870,patients treated with dpsgc experienced a faster onset of meaningful pain relief compared with placebo p
2871,rescue medication use on day and day was reduced in the dpsgc group compared with placebo vs on day vs on day p
2872,dpsgc was well tolerated and no patients treated with dpsgc reported serious adverse events
2873,as with any study there are potential limitations including study design and patient population
2874,these results indicate that dpsgc reduced pain in patients who underwent bunionectomy and this novel formulation of diclofenac potassium may be a practical option for treating mild to moderate acute pain
2875,diclofenac potassium diclofenac k mg liquid capsule is absorbed more quickly than the tablet formulation
2876,it offers potential for rapid pain relief but may alter gastro duodenal tolerability
2877,to evaluate the gastro duodenal tolerance of diclofenac k mg liquid capsules vs diclofenac k mg tablets acetylsalicylic acid asa mg tablets and ibuprofen mg liquid capsules
2878,in an endoscopist blinded randomised parallel group study volunteers received doses of diclofenac k mg liquid capsules n diclofenac k mg tablets n ibuprofen mg liquid capsules n or asa mg tablets n over days
2879,the primary outcome was the incidence of erosive gastro duodenal lesions at day secondary outcomes included modified lanza score and change in gastric mucosal prostaglandin synthesis
2880,the lowest incidence of erosive gastro duodenal lesions was with diclofenac k liquid capsules compared to with diclofenac k tablets p with ibuprofen p and with asa p
2881,results were similar for the lanza scores although diclofenac k liquid capsules were significantly superior to ibuprofen liquid capsules p
2882,diclofenac k liquid capsules inhibited prostaglandin synthesis by compared to for diclofenac k tablets p for ibuprofen p and for asa p
2883,with respect to safety adverse events were most frequent in the asa group predominantly gastrointestinal events
2884,mucosal injury with diclofenac k liquid mg liquid capsules was similar to diclofenac k mg tablets significantly lower than asa g tablets and showed some superiority over ibuprofen mg liquid capsules eudract number

2888,in a randomized double blind study we administered placebo and diclofenac sodium mg suppositories h pre operatively and on the first post operative morning to adult patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery
2889,a standardized post operative intravenous fluid regimen was instituted until oral fluids were tolerated
2890,renal function was assessed pre operatively and on the first and second post operative days by the measurement of urine output creatinine urea sodium potassium and nag n acetyl b d glucosaminidase levels and serum creatinine urea sodium and potassium concentrations
2891,on the first post operative day the diclofenac group demonstrated a reduced urinary sodium excretion
2892,on the second post operative day a reduced urinary nag creatinine ratio was observed in the diclofenac group when compared to placebo
2893,we conclude that peri operative administration of diclofenac causes changes in renal function consistent with prostaglandin inhibition on the first post operative day but had no lasting adverse effects in this group of patients
2894,our results reinforce the need for caution when administering this drug in the context of pre existing renal impairment
2895,pharmaceutical residues are present in the environment in mixtures and their adverse effects may also result from interactions that occur between compounds
2896,studies presented in this work focus on genotoxicity of pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic groups in mixtures and in individual solutions impacted with different environmental conditions assessed using comet assay alkaline approach
2897,binary mixtures of pharmaceuticals in different concentration ratios and in individual solutions impacted with ph change range from to or addition of inorganic ions were incubated with ht cells and after h time period cells were tested for the presence of dna damage
2898,to estimate whether mixtures act more synergistic or less antagonistic efficiently concentrations addition ca and independent action ia approaches were applied followed by a calculation of the model deviation ratio mdr to determine deviation from the predicted values
2899,addition of inorganic ions mainly reduced their genotoxicity
2900,diclofenac s was the most susceptible to potassium fluoride and bromide ions
2901,change of the ph of pharmaceutical solutions had significant impact on genotoxicity of diclofenac s and fluoxetine h among mixtures more commonly observed interactions were synergistic ones exactly twenty five cases ten pairs containing chloramphenicol or oxytetracycline h and ten cases of antagonism four for pairs containing chloramphenicol or fluoxetine h
2902,the results obtained indicate that interactions between tested compounds occur frequently and can lead to dna damage
2903,this topic especially concerning in vitro tests using cells is still rare however it should not be neglected
2904,this study was conducted to determine the combined effect of ramadan fasting and short term use of different non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids on renal function in healthy volunteers
2905,the study subjects were assigned to six different groups five of whom took different nsaids namely nabumetone indomethacin diclofenac sulindac tenoxicam and the sixth was a control group
2906,data were collected on serum sodium chloride potassium urea creatinine bicarbonate and uric acid as well as urinary osmolarity sodium potassium chloride and urea
2907,these measurements were taken before fasting days into fasting while using nsaids and five days after stopping the use of nsaids
2908,the results showed slight changes in serum and urine measurements during fasting while using nsaids
2909,these changes although were significant in some cases were within the normal range and were noted in all the study groups including the control group
2910,we conclude that short term use of nsaids in healthy subjects during fasting is not associated with any major adverse effects on the renal function
2911,the primary endpoint of this study was to compare the renal tolerability of amtolmetin guacyl amg diclofenac and rofecoxib in elderly patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis oa
2912,the assessment of efficacy was the secondary endpoint
2913,patients who satisfied the american college of rheumatology classification criteria for hand hip or knee oa were randomly assigned to treatment groups receiving either amg mg over thefirst days and and mg day thereafter diclofenac mg day or rofecoxib mg day for weeks
2914,at baseline and after therapy patients were clinically assessed by the same examiner who was unaware of the treatment arm assignement
2915,serum and urinary parameters of renal function and the outcome measures of efficacy were evaluated before t and after therapy t
2916,diclofenac produced a significant reduction in creatinine clearance t t p and in the daily urine volume t t p
2917,in the same treatment group a significant increase in serum creatinine blood urea nitrogen uric acid and potassium were observed
2918,rofecoxib treated patients showed a significant increase in body weight t t p systolic blood pressure t t p diastolic blood pressure t t p and serum sodium t t p associated with a significant decrease in the daily urine volume t t p and creatinine clearance t t p
2919,no significant changes in the clinical and humoral parameters were recorded in amg treated patients
2920,diclofenac was more efficacious than the other drugs p
2921,no differences were observed between amg and rofecoxib
2922,side effects related to altered kidney function were significantly higher in the rofecoxib group p
2923,diclofenac mainly impaired blood renal flow and the glomerularfiltration rate while rofecoxib negatively influenced the renal sodium water exchange
2924,amg demonstrated a renal sparing effect although the eract mechanism is unclear
2925,in continuation of our search for new substituted pyridine based anti inflammatories reaction of thienyl or furanyl hydroxyphenyl propen ones with malononitrile in alcoholic koh solution afforded a mixture of alkoxy thienyl or furanyl h benzopyrano c pyridine ones and alkoxy amino thienyl or furanyl pyridinedicarbonitriles
2926,some of the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti inflammatory and analgesic activities compared to diclofenac potassium as positive control
2927,detailed synthesis spectroscopic and toxicity data are reported
2928,a bioequivalence study of diclofenac injection test formulation diclofenac potassium hana reference formulation diclofenac sodium shinpoong was conducted in healthy male korean volunteers who received each medicine at a dose of mg in a x crossover study
2929,there was a one week washout period between the doses
2930,plasma concentrations of diclofenac were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography over a period of hours after the i m
2932,auc the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time hours was calculated by the linear log trapezoidal method
2933,cmax maximum plasma drug concentration and tmax time to reach cmax were compiled from the plasma concentration time data
2934,analysis of variance was carried out using logarithmically transformed auc and cmax and non transformed tmax
2935,there were no significant differences between the medications in auc and cmax
2936,the point estimates and confidence intervals for auc parametric and cmax parametric were to and respectively satisfying the bioequivalence criteria of the european committee for proprietary medicinal products and the us food and drug administration guidelines
2937,the corresponding value for tmax was to
2938,moreover the modified pitman morgan s adjusted f test indicated that the bioavailabilities of diclofenac in the two medications were comparable regarding intra and interindividual variability
2939,therefore these results indicate that the two medications of diclofenac are bioequivalent and thus may be prescribed interchangeably
2940,a novel simple specific sensitive and reproducible high performance liquid chromatography hplc assay method has been developed and validated for the estimation of abiraterone art in rat plasma
2941,the analytical procedure involves extraction of art and diclofenac internal standard is from rat plasma with a simple liquid liquid extraction process
2942,the chromatographic analysis was performed on a waters alliance system with a betasil c column maintained at ambient room temperature and an isocratic mobile phase acetonitrile water mm potassium dihydrogen phosphate ph v v v at a flow rate of ml min with a total run time of min
2943,the eluate was monitored using an uv detector set at nm
2944,method validation was performed as per fda guidelines and the results met the acceptance criteria
2945,the calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of ng ml r
2946,the intra and inter day precisions were and respectively in rat plasma
2947,the validated hplc method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of art in rats
2948,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri operative period
2949,however there are conflicting views on whether nsaids are associated with adverse renal effects
2950,the primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of nsaids on post operative renal function in adults
2951,electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials in cochrane controlled trials register medline and embase were performed
2952,attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials review articles and clinical practice guidelines
2953,hand searching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed
2954,the inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi randomised comparisons of individual nsaids with either each other or placebo for treatment of post operative pain with relevant post operative renal outcome measures in adult surgical patients
2955,of the trials that fulfilled the selection criteria for this review eight trials were relevant with sufficient data for meta analysis
2956,the data was extracted independently by two reviewers
2957,the primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery
2958,secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine urine volume urinary sodium level urinary potassium level fractional excretion of sodium fractional excretion of potassium need for dialysis and need for diuretic or dopamine treatment for renal insufficiency
2959,weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk for dichotomous outcomes were estimated
2960,as a group nsaids reduced creatinine clearance by ml min ci to and potassium output by mmol day ci to on the first day after surgery compared to placebo
2961,serum creatinine clearance increased on the second day after surgery by umol l ci to compared to placebo
2962,no significant reduction in urine volume during the early post operative period was found
2963,there was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early post operative period between patients receiving ketorolac and diclofenac in one trial
2964,no cases of post operative renal failure requiring dialysis were described
2965,nsaids caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early post operative period
2966,nsaids should not be withheld from adults with normal pre operative renal function because of concerns about post operative renal impairment
2967,the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors are in part mediated through the inhibition of the degradation of the vasodilator bradykinin
2968,the bradykinin effect is counteracted by cyclooxygenase inhibitors
2969,angiotensin receptor blockers arbs do not affect bradykinin
2970,to test the hypothesis that renal counteraction from a cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac is different in subjects treated with an ace inhibitor enalapril compared with an arb losartan
2971,twelve elderly healthy slightly over hydrated subjects received diclofenac orally after pre treatment with a diuretic bendroflumethiazide and enalapril or bendroflumethiazide and losartan in a double blind cross over fashion with a wash out period of at least week
2972,diclofenac reduced gfr significantly from ml min at first observations after dose for enalapril to and from after losartan to
2973,there was no significant difference between enalapril and losartan in gfr
2974,diclofenac induced decreases in urine flow excretion rates and clearances of sodium osmolality clearance and free water clearance irrespective of treatment with enalapril or losartan
2975,however serum potassium and handling of potassium were significantly lower after losartan treatment
2976,the negative renal effects of diclofenac administration in subjects with activation of the renin angiotensin system and enalapril treatment are the same in subjects with activation of the renin angiotensin system and losartan treatment
2977,mitiglinide mgn is a new potassium channel antagonist for the treatment of type diabetes mellitus
2978,in the present study a potential metabolic pathway of mgn via carboxyl linked glucuronic acid conjugation was found
2979,mgn carboxyl glucuronide was isolated from a reaction mixture consisting of mgn and human liver microsomes fortified with udp glucuronic acid udpga and identified by a hydrolysis reaction with beta glucuronidase and hplc ms ms
2980,kinetic analysis indicated that mgn from four species had the highest affinity for the rabbit liver microsomal enzyme k m mm and the lowest affinity for the dog liver microsomal enzyme k m mm
2981,the metabolic activity v max k m of mgn to the carboxyl glucuronidation was in the following order rabbit dog rat human
2982,with the assessment of mgn glucuronide formation across a panel of recombinant udp glucuronosyltransferase ugt isoforms ugta ugta ugta ugta and ugtb only ugta and ugtb exhibited high mgn glucuronosyltransferase activity
2983,the k m values of mgn glucuronidation in recombinant ugta and ugtb microsomes were close to those in human liver microsomes
2984,the formation of mgn glucuronidation by human liver microsomes was effectively inhibited by quercetin substrate for ugta and diclofenac substrate for ugtb respectively
2985,the mgn glucuronidation activities in human liver microsomes were significantly correlated with quercetin r and diclofenac glucuronidation activities r respectively
2986,these results demonstrate that ugta and ugtb are catalytic enzymes in mgn carboxyl glucuronidation in human liver
2987,boerhavia procumbens is traditionally used in the treatment of various disorders including jaundice and gonorrhea is a refrigerant and exhibits anti inflammatory and antispasmodic activities
2988,the purpose of this study was to determine the phytochemical classes antioxidant and anti inflammatory activities of methanol extract bpme and different fractions n hexane bphe ethyl acetate bpee n butanol bpbe and residual aqueous fraction bpae of b procumbens against carrageenan induced paw edema in rats
2989,to assess the anti inflammatory effects of b procumbens sprague dawley male rats g were randomly divided into seven groups
2990,group i received distilled water and group ii was treated with diclofenac potassium mg kg body weight bw orally
2991,groups iii iv v vi and vii were administered bpme bphe bpee bpbe and bpae mg kg bw orally h before the treatment with carrageenan mg kg bw in rats
2992,anti inflammatory effects of b procumbens were determined by estimating the inhibition of edema at st nd and rd hour after carrageenan injection
2993,qualitative analysis of methanol extract indicated the composition of diverse classes namely flavonoids tannins saponins phlobatannins cardiac glycosides alkaloids terpenoids and anthraquinones
2994,quantitative determination illustrated that bpbe and bpee possessed the highest concentration of total phenolic mg gallic acid equivalent per gram sample and total flavonoid content mg rutin equivalent per gram sample respectively
2995,a dose dependent response for antioxidant activity was exhibited by all the samples
2996,the sample with the highest aptitude for antioxidant activity was the bpbe for azobis ethylbenzothiozoline sulfonic acid radical scavenging and total antioxidant capacity
2997,carrageenan induced paw edema was significantly p inhibited by bpbe and bpme at the st nd and rd hour and was comparable to control drug diclofenac potassium
2998,results revealed that various fractions of b procumbens manifested the antioxidant and anti inflammatory potential and accredit the local use of b procumbens in various disorders
2999,growing evidence suggests that nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids while able to alleviate inflammation may damage articular cartilage though both chondrodestructive and chondroprotective activities have been observed with different nsaids
3000,experiments conducted on explants of normal and osteoarthritic human cartilage have shown that certain nsaids at pharmacologic concentrations achievable in man consistently inhibit glycosaminoglycan gag synthesis
3001,the addition of the prostaglandin e analogue misoprostol consistently reversed these inhibitory effects in a dose related manner
3002,paradoxically with some nsaids such as diclofenac and aspirin misoprostol was also able to enhance gag synthesis above control levels especially in osteoarthritic cartilage
3003,this supports findings from other work that nsaids exert effects other than through inhibition of cyclooxygenase direct action on cell membranes being one of these alternative mechanisms of action
3004,additionally it is interesting to note and may be of clinical relevance that misoprostol on its own also stimulates gag synthesis in explants of human osteoarthritic cartilage whilst exerting no apparent effect on healthy cartilage with a normal gag turnover
3005,with regard to renal aspects the effects of nsaids are readily explicable in terms of interference with prostanoid synthesis
3006,the consequent inhibition exerted on vasodilatory prostaglandins pgs which oppose vasoconstrictor action induced by substances such as thromboxane or leukotrienes upsets the balance that maintains renal function
3007,in situations in which there is reduced renal reserve reduction of renal pg synthesis by nsaids will adversely affect maintenance of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and excretion of sodium potassium and water
3008,patients with alcoholic cirrhosis manifest this type of compromised renal function and in them misoprostol reverses the adverse effects of indomethacin on renal hemodynamics and partially reverses indomethacin induced renal sodium retention
3009,although the clinical significance of these data is not yet established exogenous administration of specific pgs may be able to minimize the deleterious actions of nsaids
3010,the purpose of this single blind placebo controlled arm parallel randomized study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of mg diclofenac potassium cataflam novartis stein switzerland mg diclofenac sodium softgel and placebo in patients experiencing moderate to severe postoperative pain after third molar extraction
3011,seventy five patients female with a mean age of age range to years participated in the study following removal of at least impacted mandibular third molar
3012,patients received a single dose of study medication when their postoperative pain reached a moderate or severe intensity
3013,analgesic efficacy measures included the time to meaningful pain relief measured using a stopwatch and time to rescue medication
3014,pain relief pr and pain intensity pi ratings were recorded at and hours postdosing
3015,summary analgesic measures including summed pain relief score totpar and summed pain intensity differences spid were calculated from the to hour responses
3016,the time between pain relief and rescue and a global evaluation for the effectiveness of the study medications were recorded at the end of the study
3017,seven scheduled blood samples were collected from each patient for determining plasma concentrations of diclofenac anion
3018,both diclofenac sodium softgel and cataflam were significantly more effective than placebo p for all summary analgesic measures
3019,the average overall pain relief was substantially better from diclofenac sodium softgel than from cataflam but the difference was not statistically significant p
3020,in patients taking diclofenac sodium softgel of the patients experienced a time to onset of analgesic activity within minutes and the median analgesic duration was hours minutes
3021,fifty percent of the patients taking cataflam had a time to onset of action within minutes and the median duration of analgesia was hours minutes
3022,at the time of rescue drug administration or hours whichever was earlier of the patients given diclofenac sodium softgel rated the medication as a very good or excellent pain reliever whereas only of the patients taking cataflam gave these ratings
3023,no serious adverse events were observed in this study
3024,the mean concentrations of diclofenac from the diclofenac sodium softgel formulation were significantly different from the cataflam formulation
3025,the mean c max for the softgel was almost twice that of cataflam and c max was reached an hour earlier on average
3026,more diclofenac anion was absorbed at a quicker rate using the formulation diclofenac sodium softgel mg than cataflam
3027,the softgel provided a very rapid onset of analgesic activity a prolonged analgesic duration and an acceptable side effect profile in the postoperative third molar surgery pain model
3028,in an acute pain situation the rapid absorption of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs from a formulation like the softgel may positively affect the time of onset and duration of inflammatory pain compared with other commercially available nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug formulations
3029,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc is an investigational formulation that uses dispersing agents designed to facilitate rapid and consistent absorption of this nsaid
3030,the aim of this study was to characterize the effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetic pk profile of oral dpsgc at doses of and mg
3031,in this open label randomized single dose distinct doses way crossover bioavailability study healthy adult volunteers were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of dpsgc or mg after an overnight fast fasted condition or high fat breakfast fed condition period
3032,after days the participants received the same dose under the opposite fed fasted condition period
3033,serial blood samples were obtained before and through hours after study drug administration
3034,concentrations of diclofenac in plasma were determined using hplc and pk profiles were studied using ancova
3035,adverse events aes were monitored and recorded on each in clinic day
3036,of participants included in the study received the mg dose of dpsgc and received the mg dose
3037,the majority of participants were male and the mean age was years
3038,the mean sd auc values for the fasted and fed states were and ng x h ml respectively with the mg dose and and ng
3039,h ml respectively with the mg dose suggesting that the extent of absorption was similar with both dietary conditions at each dose
3040,food intake was associated with decreases in c max by nearly half in the mg group fasted vs fed vs ng ml respectively p and the mg group vs ng ml p and delayed t max in the mg group vs hours p and mg group vs hours p
3041,two mild aes nasal congestion and light headedness were reported in participants who received mg under fed conditions and mg under fasted conditions respectively
3042,food intake did not appear to affect the extent of absorption ie total exposure of oral dpsgc at doses of and mg in these healthy adult volunteers
3043,both single doses appeared to be well tolerated
3044,a study has been carried out on the actions of the prostaglandins e and f alpha and their synthesis inhibitors indomethacin and diclofenac sodium upon isolated human ureteric smooth muscle using the technique of microsuperfusion designed to ensure good tissue viability
3045,indomethacin and diclofenac sodium were shown to abolish almost completely the contractile response of ureteric muscle to electrical field stimulation
3046,contractile activity in the presence of the inhibitors could be restored by prostaglandin e or f alpha or by increasing the external potassium concentration k o of the superfusate
3047,prostaglandin e or f alpha alone were shown to increase dramatically both the phasic and tonic component of the electrically stimulated contractions on occasions inducing spontaneous activity
3048,a possible mechanism of action was elucidated with an electrophysiological technique using intracellular microelectrodes
3049,the mean membrane potential recorded was mv sd mv n
3050,the depolarising action of raising k o was demonstrated and prostaglandin f alpha x m was shown to produce a small depolarisation of the ureteric muscle cell membrane
3051,cardiomyocyte specific overexpression of aldosterone synthase in male mas mice induces a nitric oxide independent coronary dysfunction
3052,because calcium activated potassium bkca channels are essential for vascular smooth muscle cell vsmc relaxation we hypothesized that aldosterone alters their expression and or function in vsmcs
3053,left coronary artery segments were isolated from mas or male wild type mice and mounted in a wire myograph
3054,responses to acetylcholine were assessed in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor without or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac the kca inhibitors charybdotoxin plus apamin or the bkca inhibitor iberiotoxin
3055,expression of bkca was quantified in hearts by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot and in isolated coronary arteries by polymerase chain reaction
3056,the effect of aldosterone on bkca expression also was studied in cultured rat aortic vsmcs
3057,acetylcholine mediated coronary relaxation was markedly decreased in mas mice and was prevented by spironolactone
3058,diclofenac did not affect the mas induced impairment in the responses to acetylcholine whereas charybdotoxin plus apamin virtually abolished the relaxation in both male wild type and mas mice
3059,after iberiotoxin relaxation to acetylcholine was decreased to a larger extent in male wild type than in mas leading to similar levels of relaxation
3060,bkca alpha and beta subunit expressions were significantly decreased in mas heart and coronary arteries
3061,in cultured vsmcs aldosterone induced a concentration dependent decrease in bkca expression which was prevented by spironolactone
3062,aldosterone overexpression altered vsmc bkca expression and coronary bkca dependent relaxation
3063,the resulting alteration of relaxing responses may contribute to the deleterious effects of aldosterone in cardiovascular diseases
3064,bkca channels may therefore be useful therapeutic targets in cardiovascular diseases
3066,chronic postthoracotomy pain cptp consists of different types of pain
3067,some characteristics of cptp are the same as those of recognized neuropathic pain syndromes
3068,we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of pregabalin and methylcobalamin combination pg b
3069,one hundred consecutive patients with cptp after posterolateral lateral thoracotomy were prospectively randomly assigned and evaluated
3070,fifty patients were given pg b
3071,the mean ages were and years and the mean durations of pain were and months respectively
3072,the number of patients with a vas score less than at the latest follow up vas was and in the pg b
3074,duodenal webs usually give rise to symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction in infancy but they occasionally present in adulthood
3075,we report an year old woman with an unusual cause of gastric outlet obstruction
3076,peptic ulcer stricture or carcinoma were suspected but a ct scan and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed that her symptoms were the result of duodenal webs
3077,the webs were successfully dilated at endoscopy
3078,duodenal webs may rarely account for gastric outlet obstruction in adults
3079,failure to visualise the second and third parts of the duodenum at endoscopy means that the diagnosis may be missed
3080,diclofenac and slow release potassium tablets may have played an aetiological role in the formation of the webs in this patient
3081,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are widely used for inflammation control and pain relief
3082,however while the adjunct use of nsaids is avoided for periodontal therapy because of related side effects cyclic administration of nsaids may reduce or eliminate these effects
3083,we evaluated the effect of a cyclic diclofenac potassium dp regimen on clinical parameters and levels of prostaglandin e
3084,the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee
3085,forty one individuals with chronic periodontitis men women were divided into two groups test and control after initial periodontal therapy
3086,during this month randomized double blind placebo controlled study test n and control n groups were administered a cyclic regimen of dp mg twice daily or placebo
3087,clinical measurements and gcf sample collections were made at baseline and months
3088,gcf levels of pge
3089,at baseline no significant differences existed between groups for plaque indices gingival indices bleeding on probing probing depth pd or attachment levels p
3090,compared with the control group cyclic regimen in the test group suppressed increased levels of pge
3091,these results suggest that a cyclic regimen of dp may be efficacious in the management of chronic periodontitis in adults
3092,to examine the united states food and drug administration s fda standards for reviews of the scientific basis for efficacy claims for newly approved oral analgesics
3093,comparison of the trial methodologies and results provided by the fda s medical reviewer in the summary bases of approval sba for the oral acute analgesics approved in the last years ketorolac diclofenac potassium bromfenac tramadol hydrocodone ibuprofen fixed combination celecoxib rofecoxib tramadol acetaminophen and valdecoxib
3094,for all new analgesics studies were conducted in patients with postoperative dental pain and nondental surgical pain
3095,the relief of gynecologic pain was examined for of the new drugs
3096,no studies in other pain models such as infection neuropathy and nonsurgical trauma supported claims of efficacy for any of the new drugs
3097,the overall designs of the dental and nondental surgical studies including timing of the single dose of trial drug timing of evaluations scales used for evaluations and the use of both measured and derived outcome variables were similar across the development programs fully described in sbas
3098,other characteristics of the trials including choice of population for efficacy analyses methods of carrying forward pain intensity and pain relief scores and the length of time patients were encouraged to refrain from use of rescue medication differed across the development programs
3099,the requirements for approval of new analgesics in the united states encourage the pharmaceutical industry to perform efficacy studies using stylized designs in dental and nondental surgical pain
3100,studies of the efficacy of new analgesics in other common clinical settings are rarely or never included in development programs
3101,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri operative period
3102,however there there are conflicting views on whether nsaids are associated with adverse renal effects
3103,the primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of nsaids on post operative renal function in adults with normal pre operative renal function
3104,electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials in cochrane controlled trials register medline and embase were performed
3105,attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials review articles and clinical practice guidelines
3106,hand searching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed
3107,the inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi randomised comparisons of individual nsaids with either each other or placebo for treatment of post operative pain with relevant post operative renal outcome measures in adult surgical patients with normal renal function
3108,of the trials that fulfilled the selection criteria for this review eight trials were relevant with sufficient data for meta analysis
3109,the data was extracted independently by two reviewers
3110,the primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery
3111,secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine urine volume urinary sodium level urinary potassium level fractional excretion of sodium fractional excretion of potassium need for dialysis and need for diuretic or dopamine treatment for renal insufficiency
3112,weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk for dichotomous outcomes were estimated
3113,as a group nsaids reduced creatinine clearance by ml min ci to and potassium output by mmol day ci to on the first day after surgery compared to placebo
3114,serum creatinine clearance increased on the second day after surgery by umol l ci to compared to placebo
3115,no significant reduction in urine volume during the early post operative period was found
3116,there was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early post operative period between patients receiving ketorolac and diclofenac in one trial
3117,no cases of post operative renal failure requiring dialysis were described
3118,nsaids caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early post operative period in patients with normal pre operative renal function
3119,nsaids should not be withheld from adults with normal pre operative renal function because of concerns about post operative renal impairment
3120,a series of novel thiazolo derivatives was synthesized by initial condensation of dihydroxyisonicotinohydrazide and chloro hydrazinylisonicotinohydrazide with different organic reagents
3121,the pharmacological screening showed that many of these obtained compounds have good anti inflammatory analgesic anticonvulsant and antiparkinsonian activities comparable to diclofenac potassium voltarene carbamazepine and benzotropene as reference drugs
3122,initially the acute toxicity of the compounds was assayed via the determination of their ld
3123,the structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by ir h nmr c nmr ms spectral data and elemental analysis
3124,the detailed synthesis spectroscopic data ld and pharmacological activities of the synthesized compounds were reported
3125,treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors is known to cause an initial reduction in glomerular filtration rate gfr in patients with congestive heart failure
3126,the long term beneficial effects of ace inhibitors in these patients can be counteracted by cyclooxygenase inhibitors
3127,to quantify the negative renal effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac in elderly healthy subjects and to assess how treatment with an ace inhibitor after activation of the renin angiotensin system influences these renal effects
3128,fourteen elderly healthy subjects received oral diclofenac and placebo in a double blind cross over fashion
3129,the study was divided in two parts in part one subjects received no pre treatment and in part two the subjects were given pre treatment with bendroflumethiazide and enalapril in order to activate the renin angiotensin system
3130,diclofenac induced significant p decreases in gfr urine flow excretion rates of sodium and potassium electrolyte clearance osmolality clearance and free water clearance both with and without renin angiotensin system activation
3131,least square means ci of all observations during the first h after dosing showed that diclofenac caused a reduction in gfr from to ml min
3132,after pre treatment diclofenac further reduced gfr from to ml min
3133,after diclofenac administration urine flow fell from to ml min after pre treatment diclofenac gave a further reduction from to ml min
3134,more than half of the reductions were caused by the pre treatment
3135,renal function in elderly healthy subjects is impaired after acute intake of diclofenac
3136,this impairment is observed both with and without activation of the renin angiotensin system and ace inhibitor treatment but is more pronounced after pre treatment
3137,renal physiology is a partially cyclooxygenase cox dependent system
3138,kidneys express both cox and cox enzymes
3139,in this study we tried to investigate the effects of diclofenac sodium d with or without furosemide f on plasma renin activity pra serum and urine electrolytes creatinine clearance and cox and cox expression in the renal cortex
3140,forty two wistar albino rats were divided into four groups g
3141,g g g and g were treated with placebo f mg kg f mg kg plus d mg kg and d mg kg respectively and followed for seven days
3142,urinary osmolality and volume and levels of serum and urinary creatinine sodium and potassium were measured
3143,renal cox and cox expression were examined by the immunohistochemical method
3144,compared with g body weights were significantly reduced in g and g p for all
3145,serum sodium in g decreased significantly compared with g g and g
3146,serum potassium in g decreased significantly compared with g and g
3147,urine volume in g increased significantly compared with g g and g
3148,urine osmolality in g and g decreased significantly compared with g and g
3149,urine na in g increased significantly compared with g
3150,although urine k was lowest in g there were no statistically significant differences between the groups
3151,creatinine clearance decreased in g compared with the other groups
3152,pra was similar in all groups
3153,renal cortical cox expression was lowest in g
3154,cox expression in cortical collecting tubules was significantly reduced in g and g compared with g and g p for all
3155,although creatinine clearance in g was significantly lower than in g cox and cox expression were no different in g and g
3156,acute renal failure was caused by d f prevented development of renal failure in rats treated with a combination of d and f the diuretic effect of f was neutralized by d whereas cox expression was reduced by d and by the combination of d and f in g and g renal cox immunoreactivity was increased by f and d and the combination of both
3157,although creatinine clearance was lower in rats that were given d alone compared with the combination of f and d cox and cox expression were similar in these groups
3158,recently we demonstrated the expression of kcnq kcnq and kcnq transcripts in monkey retinal pigment epithelium rpe and showed that the m type current in rpe cells is blocked by the specific kcnq channel blocker xe
3159,using patch clamp electrophysiology we investigated the pharmacological sensitivity of the m type current in isolated monkey rpe cells to elucidate the subunit composition of the channel
3160,most rpe cells exhibited an m type current with a voltage for half maximal activation of approximately mv
3161,the m type current activation followed a double exponential time course and was essentially complete within s the m type current was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of the nonselective kcnq channel blockers linopirdine and xe but was relatively insensitive to block by m chromanol b or mm tetraethylammonium tea two kcnq channel blockers
3162,the m type current was activated by m retigabine an opener of all kcnq channels except kcnq m zinc pyrithione which augments all kcnq channels except kcnq and m n ethylmaleimide which activates kcnq kcnq and kcnq but not kcnq or kcnq channels
3163,application of camp which activates kcnq and kcnq channels had no significant effect on the m type current
3164,finally diclofenac which activates kcnq and kcnq channels but inhibits kcnq channels inhibited the m type current in the majority of rpe cells but activated it in others
3165,the results indicate that the m type current in monkey rpe is likely mediated by channels encoded by kcnq and kcnq subunits
3166,the present study was conducted to evaluate the utilization of clark s salisbury and penna s rules and the body surface area bsa formula for calculation of pediatric drug dosage as well as their reliability and viability in the clinical use
3167,these rules are frequently cited in the literature but much controversy still exists with regards to their use
3168,the pediatric drug dosage was calculated by utilization of the aforementioned rules and using the drugs paracetamol dipyrone diclofenac potassium nimesulide amoxicillin and erythromycin widely employed in pediatric dentistry
3169,weight and body surface areas were considered of children with ages between and years old as well as the dosage for the adult
3170,the pediatric dosages achieved were compared to the predetermined dosages in mg kg herein named standard dosages
3171,the results were submitted to the parametric test anova and to the tukey test p
3172,the antibiotics and diclofenac provides acceptable utilization of the rules in pediatric dentistry however for the dipyrone the dosages obtained by the rules suggest their clinical ineffectiveness
3173,for the paracetamol the penna s rule and the bsa formula should not be clinically employed especially for children between and years old once such dosages were much close to the hepatotoxic dosage of the drug
3174,it can be concluded that the use of the rules for safe calculation of the pediatric drug dosage is possible and it depends on the used drug and age group
3175,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids can play a major role in the management of acute pain in the peri operative period
3176,however there are conflicting views on whether nsaids are associated with adverse renal effects
3177,the primary objective of this review was to determine the effects of nsaids on postoperative renal function in adults with normal preoperative renal function
3178,electronic searches for relevant randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials in cochrane central register of controlled trials medline and embase were performed
3179,attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of relevant trials review articles and clinical practice guidelines
3180,handsearching of conference abstracts published in major anaesthetic journals was also performed
3181,date of most recent search may
3182,the inclusion criteria were randomised or quasi randomised comparisons of individual nsaids with either each other or placebo for treatment of postoperative pain with relevant postoperative renal outcome measures in adult surgical patients with normal renal function
3183,the data were extracted independently by two authors
3184,the primary outcome measure was creatinine clearance within the first two days after surgery
3185,secondary outcome measures included serum creatinine urine volume urinary sodium level urinary potassium level fractional excretion of sodium fractional excretion of potassium and need for dialysis
3186,weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk rr and risk difference rd for dichotomous outcomes were estimated with confidence intervals ci
3187,twenty three trials patients fulfilled the selection criteria for this review
3188,nsaids reduced creatinine clearance by ml min ci to and potassium output by mmol day ci to on the first day after surgery compared to placebo
3189,there was no significant difference in serum creatinine on the first day umol l ci to compared to placebo
3190,no significant reduction in urine volume during the early postoperative period was found
3191,there was no significant difference in serum creatinine in the early postoperative period between patients receiving diclofenac ketorolac indomethacin ketoprofen or etodolac
3192,no cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis were described
3193,the trials were not heterogeneous for the primary outcome
3194,nsaids caused a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function in the early postoperative period in patients with normal preoperative renal function
3195,nsaids should not be withheld from adults with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment
3196,to compare the in vitro human ureteric muscle response to calcium channel and alpha adrenoceptor antagonists to determine the promoting factor for stone passage
3197,clinical trials suggest that stone passage in renal colic can be promoted by ureteric relaxation using these agents however nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs appear to reduce ureteric activity in vitro but do not promote stone passage when used in clinical trials
3198,human ureteric muscle strips were used to record the effect that each drug had on muscle tone in vitro
3199,the ureter was obtained at open nephrectomy or cystectomy
3200,potassium enriched krebs solution was used to evoke maximal muscle tone followed by adding each drug in increasing concentrations to determine the percentage reduction in tone
3201,the drugs used to represent each group were nifedipine methylurapidil mu and diclofenac
3202,in all ureteric strips were obtained from patients
3203,at all drug concentrations the in vitro relaxant effect of nifedipine and mu was greater than that of diclofenac
3204,at m the median reduction in proximal and distal ureteric tone to diclofenac nifedipine and mu were and vs and respectively
3205,nifedipine and mu produced greater ureteric relaxation in vitro than diclofenac they predominantly relax distal ureter
3206,this suggests that a reduction in ureteric muscle tone as opposed to complete ablation of activity might be the promoting factor for stone passage
3207,the early phase of orthodontic tooth movement involves sterile acute inflammation of the periodontal ligament in response to biomechanical forces
3208,anti inflammatories are pharmacologic agents used in medical and dentistry clinics
3209,the aim of the study was to analyse the bone remodelling during orthodontic movement under non steroidal and steroidal treatment
3210,male wistar rats n were randomly divided into three groups c control non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid potassium diclofenac and steroidal anti inflammatory drug said dexamethasone dissodium phosphate
3211,the animals of the c group received per cent saline solution the nsaid group received potassium diclofenac cataflam mg kg and the said group received dexamethasone dissodium phosphate dexanil mg kg
3212,animals were sacrificed or days after placement of the orthodontic appliance
3213,the upper first molars were processed histologically we quantified the blood vessels howship lacunae and osteoclast like cells present on the tension and compression sides of the periodontal ligament
3214,bone formation was evaluated under polarized light microscopy image pro plus software calculated the percentage of immature mature collagen present
3215,the results showed that in and days nsaid and said groups presented fewer blood vessels howship lacunae and osteoclast like cells when compared to the control group
3216,on the th and th days there was a lower percentage of mature collagen in the said group p
3217,these data demonstrate that potassium diclofenac and dexamethasone inhibit bone resorption during the initial period of orthodontic movement and that dexamethasone delays the collagen maturation process in established bone matrix
3218,the present study was performed to determine the characteristics of the endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor edhf that mediates the nitric oxide no and prostacyclin pgi independent hyperpolarization and relaxation of porcine renal interlobar arteries
3219,bradykinin induced changes in isometric force or smooth muscle membrane potential were assessed in rings of porcine renal interlobar artery preconstricted with the thromboxane analogue u in the continuous presence of n omega nitro l arginine and diclofenac to inhibit no synthases and cyclo oxygenases
3220,inhibition of no and pgi production induced a rightward shift in the concentration relaxation curve to bradykinin without affecting maximal relaxation
3221,edhf mediated relaxation was abolished by a depolarizing concentration of kcl mm as well as by a combination of charybdotoxin and apamin each nm two inhibitors of calcium dependent k k ca channels
3222,charybdotoxin and apamin also reduced the bradykinin induced edhf mediated hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells from mv to mv
3223,in addition to the ubiquitous alpha subunit of the na k atpase the interlobar artery expressed the gamma subunit as well as the ouabain sensitive alpha alpha subunits
3224,a low concentration of ouabain nm abolished the edhf mediated relaxation and reduced the bradykinin induced hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells mv versus mv in the absence and presence of ouabain
3225,chelation of k using cryptate inhibited edhf mediated relaxation without affecting no mediated responses
3226,elevating extracellular kcl from to mm elicited a transient ouabain sensitive hyperpolarization and relaxation that was endothelium independent and insensitive to charybdotoxin and apamin
3227,these results indicate that in the renal interlobar artery edhf mediated responses display the pharmacological characteristics of k ions released from endothelial k ca channels
3228,smooth muscle cell hyperpolarization and relaxation appear to be dependent on the activation of highly ouabain sensitive subunits of the na k atpase
3229,to evaluate the role of topical instillation of anti inflammatory or antiallergic agents on experimental elevation of aqueous flare induced by prostaglandin e pge in pigmented rabbits
3230,transcorneal diffusion of pge microg ml x mmol l by means of a glass cylinder produced aqueous flare elevation

3232,aqueous flare was measured with a laser flare cell meter
3233,results are given as mean sd
3234,double instillations of betamethasone sodium phosphate and fluorometholone acetate at and hours before pge application inhibited and respectively of flare elevation
3235,double instillations of diclofenac sodium and pranoprofen at and hours before pge application did not inhibit flare elevation
3236,double instillations of betamethasone fluorometholone diclofenac and pranoprofen at and hour before pge application inhibited and respectively of flare elevation
3237,double instillations of cromolyn sodium tranilast levocabastine hydrochloride pemirolast potassium and ibudilast at and hour before pge application did not inhibit flare elevation
3238,single instillation of betamethasone hours before pge application inhibited of pge induced aqueous flare elevation
3239,single instillation of diclofenac hour before pge application inhibited of pge induced aqueous flare elevation
3240,betamethasone needed several hours after topical instillation to inhibit flare elevation but diclofenac needed hour
3241,antiallergic agents did not affect disruption of the blood aqueous barrier in rabbits
3242,corticosteroid eyedrops may need several hours from instillation to show action

3246,addition of bacteriocin produced by l acidophilus la to a h old culture of l monocytogenes scotta repressed cell growth in the following h
3247,treatment of stationary phase cells of l monocytogenes scotta cfu ml by the bacteriocin resulted in growth inhibition
3248,growth of l acidophilus la was not inhibited by commercial drugs from different generic groups including nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid containing diclofenac potassium or ibuprofen arginine
3249,only one non antibiotic drug tested atlansil an antiarrhythmic agent had an inhibitory effect on l acidophilus la with mic of mg ml
3250,l acidophilus la was not affected by drugs containing sodium or potassium diclofenac
3251,l acidophilus la shows a good resistance to several drugs and may be applied in combination for therapeutic use
3252,it is generally accepted that achieving complete anaesthesia with an inferior alveolar nerve block ianb in mandibular molars with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis is more challenging than for other teeth
3253,therefore administration of non steroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaids hour prior to anaesthetic administration has been proposed as a means to increase the efficacy of the ianb in such patients
3254,the purpose of this prospective double blind randomized clinical trial was to determine the effect of administration of oral premedication with ketorolac keto and diclofenac potassium dp on the efficacy of ianb in patients with irreversible pulpitis
3255,one hundred and fifty patients with irreversible pulpitis were evaluated preoperatively for pain using heft parker visual analogue scale after which they were randomly divided into three groups
3256,the subjects received identical tablets of ketorolac diclofenac pottasium or cellulose powder placebo hour prior to administration of ianb with lidocaine containing epinephrine
3257,lip numbness as well as positive and negative responses to cold test were ascertained
3258,additionally pain score of each patient was recorded during cavity preparation and root canal instrumentation

3268,in the present multicenter randomized double blind placebo controlled trial patients experiencing a baseline level of pain mm on a mm visual analog scale within hours after surgery were randomized to receive a single dose of dpsgc at or mg or placebo
3269,pain intensity and relief were assessed for hours after dosing
3270,the efficacy endpoints included the summed pain intensity difference total pain relief and the median time to the onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief using the stopwatch method
3271,a total of randomized patients had a significant increase in the summed pain intensity difference and total pain relief values at and hours across all dpsgc treated groups compared with the placebo group p
3272,the onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief was significantly faster in all dpsgc groups than in the placebo group including the dpsgc mg group minutes p and minutes p for perceptible and meaningful pain relief respectively
3273,significantly fewer patients in the dpsgc groups required rescue medication compared with those in the placebo group p
3274,the global evaluation scores were significantly greater for the patients who received dpsgc than for those who received placebo p and more than of dpsgc treated patients rated the medication as good very good or excellent compared with of the placebo treated patients
3275,dpsgc was generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported
3276,the results from the present single dose study of postoperative dental pain suggest that dpsgc offers significant pain relief compared with placebo and that the study medication provided was well tolerated by patients who required pain relief after third molar extraction
3277,to determine the effect of different cyclo oxygenase cox inhibitors on primary dysmenorrheic pain
3278,eleven female patients self medicated with either placebo sugar mg of the cox specific inhibitor rofecoxib mg of the nonselective cox inhibitor diclofenac potassium or mg of the cox selective inhibitor meloxicam over menstrual cycles
3279,pain was assessed using the mcgill pain questionnaire and a visual analog scale
3280,the pain response index present pain index and visual analog scale were highly correlated as measures of intensity of pain r to p
3281,rofecoxib and diclofenac potassium both decreased the duration of dysmenorrheic pain compared with placebo p and with meloxicam p and were equally effective in improving pain compared with placebo after each capsule p
3282,when compared with placebo both drugs also provided or more pain relief after each capsule p
3283,meloxicam although superior to placebo was not as effective as rofecoxib and diclofenac potassium in reducing pain and when compared with placebo was associated with providing or more of pain relief only after the third and fourth capsules p
3284,rofecoxib and diclofenac potassium when taken in recommended doses were equally effective in alleviating pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea
3285,despite the devastating collapse of three vulture populations on the asian subcontinent as a result of their exposure to diclofenac there is little available information on the normal physiology of many vulture species including the african white backed vulture gyps africanus
3286,such information is needed to fully understand mechanisms for toxicity and to identify and prevent future health problems
3287,the aim of this study was to establish baseline parameters for hematologic and selected serum chemistry parameters for this model species for further studies into the toxicity of diclofenac
3288,captive nonreleasable and wild african white backed vultures were used to determine reference values
3289,for hematology erythrocyte counts hemoglobin concentration hematocrit packed cell volume mean corpuscular volume mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and total and differential leukocyte counts were measured
3290,chemical analytes measured included sodium potassium calcium albumin and globulin concentrations aspartate aminotransferase creatine kinase and alanine aminotransferase activities
3291,uric acid and urea concentrations and the urea uric acid ratio also were evaluated
3292,values are presented as means standard deviations and reference intervals
3293,the serum chemistry parameters selected may provide a starting point for the evaluation of changes in renal and hepatic function these organ systems are most severely affected by diclofenac
3294,results were also compared with values reported for g africanus nestlings and from these results it is evident that the clinical pathologic parameters are age related
3295,this indicates that the use of nestling values for the evaluation of clinical pathologic findings in adults may be unreliable and could lead to incorrect assumptions
3296,to analyze dental prescribing errors in aracaju brazil and to suggest feasible improvements for patient safety
3297,a descriptive study was conducted at nine primary health care units phcus in the northeast region of brazil
3298,a convenience sample of dental prescriptions was selected during the period february may the world health organization who prescribing criteria were used to measure the quality of the prescriptions
3299,all medications were prescribed by generic name of prescription information contained abbreviations and of them were classified as having low legibility or as being illegible
3300,the most commonly prescribed medications were diclofenac both sodium and potassium and amoxicillin
3301,dental prescribing errors should be considered as a potential area for improvement in the medication management process and patient safety
3302,we suggest that a pharmacist should be available for medication dispensing at all units and that dentists are trained continuously so that medication orders may become more legible and complete
3303,improving the quality of dental prescriptions will reduce the risks for medication errors and will promote the rational use of pharmacotherapy and patient safety
3304,carrageenans are hydrocolloids in the rubbery state at standard conditions
3305,they are useful excipients for controlled release tablets
3306,three carrageenans two kappa carrageenans gelcarin gp nf and gp nf and one iota carrageenan gelcarin gp nf are analyzed regarding their release behavior in combination with sorption swelling and rheology
3307,the iota carrageenan has a higher substitution by sulfate groups
3308,the kappa carrageenan gelcarin gp nf contains a small amount of potassium chloride left over from processing
3309,water sorption of the pure materials was studied gravimetrically and the rheology of different solutions and w w was studied by cup cylinder rotation viscosimetry
3310,swelling was determined as the vertical expansion of the tablets with a specially designed swelling apparatus
3311,drug release from the tablets was performed by the usp paddle method for hr
3312,the data indicate that drug release increases when water sorption and swelling extent decrease and as viscosity increases
3313,the order of release is nearly zero order kinetics for theophylline monohydrate a nonionic drug
3314,diffusion of the anionic drug diclofenac sodium is anomalous
3315,in addition the influence of the added salts potassium and calcium chloride on swelling and release was studied
3316,before tableting physical mixtures of these salts with and without theophylline monohydrate were prepared
3317,swelling and release change in the same order but this is only valid when the ionic interactions responsible for this are strong enough
3318,besides this physical mixing of salts with the carrageenans can result in an increased release of drug caused by decreased cohesion of the matrix during drug release mainly for calcium chloride
3319,stem bark of alnus nitida spach endl
3320,family betulaceae is used by local communities in northern areas of pakistan as a remedy for swelling injuries and pain
3321,however no pharmacological study of this plant has been reported to confirm these activities
3322,in this study anti inflammatory and analgesic effect of a nitida stem bark have been evaluated
3323,powder of the stem bark of a nitida was extracted with methanol anbm and partitioned in escalating polarity to get the n hexane anbh chloroform anbc ethyl acetate anbe and the residual soluble aqueous anba fractions

3325,the extracts fractions were also evaluated for analgesic effects by using hot plate analgesic test and acetic acid induced writhing test in rat
3326,the anbm composition was analyzed by hplc dad and gc ms analysis
3327,results of heat induced albumin denaturation activity indicated that among the extract fractions anbc at concentration range of g ml remarkably protected the heat induced albumin denaturation
3328,the pretreatment with anbc significantly reduced the carrageenan induced edema with after h comparing with reduction produced by the reference drug diclofenac potassium
3329,histopathological alterations of the gastric and hind paw were decreased with the extract fractions
3330,furthermore anti inflammatory effects of anbc were evident in freunds complete adjuvant induced arthritis histamine induced paw edema and xylene induced ear edema
3331,the latency time in hot plate analgesic assay with anbc after min was comparable to standard drug morphine and aspirin
3332,similarly anbc significantly p inhibited the pain sensation in acetic acid induced writhing test in rat
3333,hplc dad analysis of anbm indicated the presence of gallic acid catechin and rutin while the gc ms analysis of anbm indicated the presence of compounds predominantly of neophytadiene tetramethyl hexadecen ol phytol vitamin e and linalool
3334,the results of this study suggested that the presence of polyphenols sterols terpenoids and other constituents might contributed towards the anti inflammatory and analgesic activities of the crude methanol extract of a nitida bark and its derived fractions
3335,this study endorsed the folklore use of a nitida bark for inflammation related disorders
3336,tissue kallikrein an essential enzyme in the formation of vascular kinins contributes to flow dependent dilatation fdd in large arteries
3337,we hypothesized that the vascular kinin kallikrein system may be involved in shear stress signalling in small resistance arteries which have a key role in the systemic regulation of blood pressure
3338,to investigate the role of the vascular kallikrein kinin system in mesenteric resistance arteries of mice during acute changes in blood flow
3339,arteries from wild type mice tk and mice lacking tissue kallikrein tk were mounted in an arteriograph for the recording of changes in outer diameter during step increases in flow rate
3340,responses to phenylephrine acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside were not different between the two strains
3341,fdd was significantly reduced in arteries of tk mice compared with that in mesenteric arteries of tk mice exposed to phenylephrine p
3342,fdd was no longer different between tk and tk mice when experiments were performed in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase nos inhibitor n nitro l arginine methyl ester l name p l name plus diclofenac p or l name plus diclofenac plus potassium chloride p indicating that inactivation of tissue kallikrein preferentially affects the contribution of nitric oxide to flow response
3343,however expression of endothelial nos was comparable between tk and tk mesenteric arteries
3344,finally the bradykinin b receptor antagonist hoe significantly decreased fdd in tk but not in tk arteries p and p respectively
3345,these results demonstrate the specific role of the tissue kallikrein in flow induced dilatation which is mediated by nitric oxide and bradykinin b receptor activation in resistance arteries
3346,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc is a rapidly absorbed formulation of diclofenac potassium developed for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain
3347,the present study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety profile of dpsgc mg in patients with pain after first metatarsal bunionectomy

3351,subsequent doses were given every hours over a hour inpatient multiple dose period and continued over an additional hour outpatient multiple dose period
3352,opioid rescue medication was available as needed after the second dose of study medication
3353,the primary efficacy end point was the mean nprs score over the hour inpatient multiple dose period
3354,additional measures included nprs scores at predefined times over hours the summed pain intensity difference over hours spid the time weighted sum of pain relief scores over the first hours the mean dosing interval the time from dosing to the time rescue medication or the next dose of study medication was administered whichever was less the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication and the onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief stopwatch method
3355,tolerability was assessed based on physician monitoring and patient reporting of adverse events aes and the results of standard laboratory tests
3356,of randomized patients dpsgc mg placebo female white mean sd age years weight range kg completed the study
3357,mean baseline nprs scores did not differ significantly between the dpsgc and placebo groups and respectively
3358,dpsgc was associated with significant improvements compared with placebo in mean nprs score over hours vs respectively p mean spid vs p and overall mean dosing interval vs min p
3359,significant differences in nprs scores between dpsgc mg and placebo were noted at all time points from baseline through hours p
3360,the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication was significantly lower in the dpsgc group compared with the placebo group vs on day vs on day both p
3361,patients receiving dpsgc had a significantly faster onset of meaningful pain relief compared with those receiving placebo p
3362,the most commonly reported aes were nausea vs headache vs vomiting vs and constipation vs
3363,the overall incidence of aes occurring in or of patients was significantly lower in the dpsgc group than in the placebo group vs p no patient receiving dpsgc had a serious ae
3364,dpsgc mg taken every hours was effective in reducing postbunionectomy pain in the patients studied
3365,dpsgc was well tolerated suggesting that it may be a practicable option for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain

3368,we examined the control of vascular tone in rat main superior mesenteric artery
3369,three standard rings mm in length of the mesenteric artery were cut beginning mm mm and mm distally from the mesenteric arteryaorta junction
3370,in noradrenaline precontracted rings relaxations to acetylcholine in the absence and presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac did not differ in the studied sections
3371,however the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ng nitro l arginine methyl ester attenuated the diclofenac resistant responses to acetylcholine more effectively in the proximal than the distal section
3372,glibenclamide an inhibitor of atp sensitive k channels diminished relaxations evoked by acetylcholine only in the distal section whereas the inhibitor of ca activated k channels apamin attenuated the responses in all sections
3373,furthermore relaxation sensitivity to nitroprusside and isoprenaline was lower in the proximal than distal section
3374,arterial contractile sensitivity to noradrenaline and potassium chloride was higher while the maximal contractile force generation was lower in the proximal than the distal part
3375,in conclusion in different sections of rat main superior mesenteric artery considerable variability was observed in vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses as well as in the contribution of endothelial nitric oxide and endothelium mediated hyperpolarization to vasodilation
3376,therefore the present results emphasize the fact that only corresponding vessel segments should be used when investigating the control of arterial tone

3411,birth weight and maternal blood pressure were unrelated to the level of consumption of glycyrrhizic acid in finnish women with infants but babies whose mother consumed mg wk were more likely to be born before weeks
3412,the cosmetic ingredient review cir expert panel noted that the ingredients in this safety assessment are not plant extracts powders or juices but rather are specific chemical species that may be isolated from the licorice plant
3413,because these chemicals may be isolated from plant sources however steps should be taken to assure that pesticide and toxic metal residues are below acceptable levels
3414,the panel advised the industry that total polychlorobiphenyl pcb pesticide contamination should be limited to not more than ppm with not more than ppm for any specific residue and that toxic metal levels must not contain more than mg kg of arsenic as as not more than heavy metals and not more than mg kg of lead as pb
3415,although the panel noted that glycyrrhizic acid is cytotoxic at high doses and ingestion can have physiological effects there is little acute short term subchronic or chronic toxicity and it is expected that these ingredients would be poorly absorbed through the skin
3416,these ingredients are not considered to be irritants sensitizers phototoxic agents or photosensitizers at the current maximum concentration of use

3425,we conclude that dihydralazine mediated changes can be reduced by cyclo oxygenase inhibition most likely on the basis of a reduction of its effect on peripheral resistance thereby leading to less reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous and renin angiotensin systems
3426,what happens to the old headache medicines
3428,old headache medicines never die they either fade away or come back in disguise
3429,the disguise is often a new route of administration which may work better faster more completely with fewer adverse events and or have certain other advantages
3430,the clinical aspects of of the oldest headache medicines ergotamine tartrate dihydroergotamine and methysergide will be discussed here

3435,dahl f c maassen van den brink a the hydroxytryptamine ht receptor family mediates the effects of several drugs highly effective in migraine primarily by activating ht b ht d and ht f receptors
3436,ergotamine dihydroergotamine and methysergide as well as the triptan sumatriptan are all agonists for these receptors
3437,the receptor profile and degree of selectivity of these drugs differ which is reflected by their side effects that limit their use in the acute and prophylactic treatment of migraine
3438,the acute antimigraine efficacy of these remedies is very much dependent on the formulation used where in general parenteral formulations are more effective in relieving the symptoms of a migraine attack

3444,only sisomycin and miconazole among the topical medications elicited a positive patch test reaction in and patients respectively
3445,neomycin contact sensitivity was not seen in any of the patients
3446,one patient who had exacerbation of venous eczema following accidental application of topical diclofenac showed a positive patch test reaction to it
3447,patch test should be used to identify the topical agents that may be responsible for perpetuation or aggravation of eczema especially in patients who do not improve despite adequate treatment of other underlying cause s
3448,a series of heterocyclic derivatives was synthesized using benzoyl dioxo phenyl pyrrolidin yl acetic acid ethyl ester as starting material
3449,treatment of with n naoh or hydrazine hydrate afford the corresponding acid and acid hydrazides and which were reacted with several reagents to produce some new peptido hetero organic derivatives the pharmacological screening showed that many of these newly synthesized compounds have good anti inflammatory and analgesic activities comparable to diclofenac potassium and valdecoxib as reference drugs
3450,the aim was to study the contribution of atp sensitive potassium channels katp channels in the coronary vasodilatation produced by prostaglandins i e and d in rats
3451,isolated langendorff rat hearts perfused under constant flow conditions and rat aortic rings were used
3452,dose response curves to pge pgd and iloprost a pgi analogue were performed before and during katp channel blockade with glibenclamide
3453,arachidonic acid was used to increase the formation of endogenous pgi
3454,infusions of pge pgd and iloprost in isolated hearts induced marked vasodilatation as reflected by the reduction in coronary perfusion pressure of sem and for microm pge pgd and iloprost respectively
3455,infusion of glibenclamide microm was accompanied by a increase in coronary perfusion pressure
3456,the vasodilatation induced by levcromakalim microm was completely inhibited in the presence of glibenclamide whereas that of papaverine microm was unaffected
3457,glibenclamide significantly reduced the vasodilatation induced by iloprost at to nm pge and nm and pgd and nm at all concentrations studied
3458,in contrast glibenclamide microm had no effect on iloprost induced relaxation of aortic rings
3459,arachidonic acid infusion from to microm in isolated hearts induced a pronounced vasodilatation and a significant release of keto pgf alpha into the coronary effluent in a dose dependent fashion
3460,both responses to arachidonic acid were significantly reduced in the presence of the cyclo oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac microm
3461,in an additional experimental series the vasodilatation induced by arachidonic acid infusions was found to be significantly reduced in the presence of glibenclamide
3462,glibenclamide is a potent inhibitor of the coronary dilator action of prostaglandins i e and d
3463,this observation suggests that these prostaglandins may cause vasodilatation by opening katp channels
3464,beau lines are transverse band like depressions extending from one lateral edge of the nail to the other and affecting all nails at corresponding levels
3465,onychomadesis is considered an extreme form of beau line with subsequent separation of the proximal nail plate from the nail bed
3466,both fall along a spectrum of nail plate abnormalities that occur secondary to temporary nail matrix arrest nma
3467,various systemic and dermatologic conditions have been reported in association with onychomadesis table
3468,nail changes can affect all or some of the nails and both the fingernails and toenails however fingernails are more frequently affected
3469,the severity of the nail changes varies depending on the underlying cause its duration and environmental factors
3470,we present a case of onychomadesis following cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis clcv
3471,a year old woman presented to the dermatology clinic complaining of a purpuric rash that began on her lower extremities and rapidly progressed to her abdomen and upper extremities over the previous five days
3472,her medical history was remarkable for hypertension and diet controlled diabetes mellitus
3473,her medications included enalapril which she had been taking for the past four years
3474,on three consecutive days before the skin eruption the patient took oral diclofenac sodium for hip pain
3475,a clinical examination revealed non blanching petechial rash on the legs abdomen and upper limbs up to the elbow figure a with leukocytoclastic vasculitis on biopsy figure b
3476,direct immunofluorescence was negative
3477,laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of l with a normal differential count and a platelet count of l
3478,westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate was mm st h and c reactive protein was at mg dl
3479,antinuclear antibodies rheumatoid factor immune complexes and cryoglobulinemia were negative as were b and c hepatitis virus serological tests
3480,her renal cardiac pulmonary and abdominal exams were normal
3481,diclofenac was discontinued due to a clinical suspicion of drug induced cutaneous vasculitis
3482,the rash resolved in weeks without treatment leaving post inflammatory hyperpigmentation
3483,four weeks later she presented with painless palpable grooves on all fingernails figure
3484,the grooves were to mm in width at a similar distance from the proximal nail fold
3485,there were no signs of periungual inflammation
3486,the patient denied any recent history of trauma unusual activities or chemical exposure
3487,routine serum biochemistry and hematology results were normal
3488,repeated potassium hydroxide preparations and fungal cultures of the nail clippings were negative
3489,a diagnosis of beau lines and onychomadesis was made
3490,nail changes were tolerable and did not require any specific treatment
3491,during the follow up the beau lines advanced with the linear growth of the nails and disappeared figure and
3492,four fingernails developed complete nail shedding onychomadesis
3493,no toenail alterations were observed in this period
3494,a complete recovery of the nail plate surface was observed after months
3495,the nail matrix epithelium is formed by highly proliferating cells that differentiate and keratinize to produce the nail plate
3496,the nail matrix epithelium is very susceptible to toxic noxae and acute damage results in a defective nail plate formation
3497,nail matrix arrest is a term used to describe a temporary inhibition of the nail matrix proliferation that can present as beau lines and onychomadesis
3498,the width of beau lines relates to the duration of the etiological agent
3499,as the nail adheres firmly to the nail bed the onychomadesis remains latent for several weeks before leading to temporary shedding
3500,there are several proposed etiological mechanisms for nma
3501,nma associated with fever severe infection and major medical illnesses can be explained by an inflammation of the matrix periungual tissues or digital blood vessels chemotherapy agents temporary inhibit the mitotic activity in nail matrix the detection of coxackie virus in the shedding nail particle following hand foot and mouth disease suggests that the viral replication itself may directly damage the nail matrix
3502,however as nail changes are not unique it may be difficult to incriminate a single etiological agent
3503,our patient presented with an onset of beau lines seven weeks after the initial clcv lesions which suggests that vasculitis might have acted as a trigger for nma
3504,as the fingers were not affected by clcv an indirect effect of vasculitis is more plausible
3505,leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel inflammatory disease mediated by a deposition of immune complexes
3506,thus the circulating immune complexes may be involved in the damage of nail bed microvasculature
3507,considering that the patient had been receiving enalapril and diclofenac it is less likely that those drugs were involved in the pathogenesis of nma
3508,enalapril was continued and the nail changes were resolved while patient was still on enalapril
3509,furthermore diclofenac is a widely prescribed drug and its association with nma is yet to be described in literature
3510,we described a patient who developed beau lines and onychomadesis following cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis
3511,this clinical observation can expand the spectrum of possible causes of nail matrix arrest
3512,dopamine causes in anesthetized rats expressed diuretic response that is accompanied by an increase in grf and a significant enhance of sodium and potassium excretion
3513,pretreatment the animals in diclofenac sodium or contrical in doses that inhibit respectively activity of renal pg system and kallikrein kinin system don t prevent of renal effects of dopamine
3514,preliminary assignment a direct renin inhibitor aliskiren enhances the diuretic natriuretic and kaliyuretic effects of the drug
3515,it is concluded that renal pg system and kallikrein kinin system are not involved in the formation of renal effects of dopamine
3516,renal tissue ras directly included in the mechanism of action of dopamine in the kidney acting as a modulator preventing excessive loss of water and electrolytes with urine
3517,the objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of ultrasound guided surgical drainage in submasseteric space abscess of odontogenic origin without incision
3518,eleven patients males and females aged to years were included in this study
3519,each patient had clinically and radiologically diagnosed submasseteric space abscesses of odontogenic origin
3520,all the patients underwent ultrasound guided drainage by using mhz b mode gray scale ultrasound scanner
3521,the aspirated pus was sent for microbiological culture and sensitivity tests
3522,all the patients were given a prescription of antibiotics like amoxicillin with clavulanate in a dose of mg hourly daily metronidazole mg h daily and analgesic diclofenac potassium in a dose of mg h daily
3523,infection was considered resolving when the following criteria were met like ceased or minimal drainage
3524,there was successful resolution of abscess in cases case underwent incision and drainage because of spread of infection to other spaces
3525,this study on cases supported ultrasonography as an intraoperative aid in the assessment of the abscess cavity and its real time imaging facility will help in the location and drainage of the abscess cavity effectively
3526,it avoids large unsightly postoperative facial scars and often eliminates the need of general anesthesia and hospitalization
3527,to compare excretion of ions and prostaglandins by the kidney in children with noctural enuresis
3528,thirty two children with primary nocturnal enuresis and normal children were examined
3529,osmolality and sodium and potassium concentrations were measured in their urine and blood serum
3530,prostaglandins e e and falpha were determined using kits for immunoenzyme analysis
3531,luminal and contraluminal prostaglandin secretions were studied in frog urinary bladder
3532,children with nocturnal enuresis have increased nocturnal diuresis and renal sodium excretion but no increase was found in excretion of prostaglandins e e and falpha
3533,administration of sodium diclofenac before bed time eliminated episodes of nocturnal enuresis in of children intranasal administration of adiuretin sd had a positive effect in of enuretics
3534,in children with nocturnal enuresis there is a correlation between renal excretion of pge and sodium ions this correlation is absent in the control group children and disappears in enuretics treated with desmopressin
3535,to evaluate the representativeness of the data on prostaglandin secretions to urine as compared with their release to extracellular fluid experiments on frog urinary bladder were performed a correlation was found between prostaglandin secretion to the urinary bladder lumen and to the extracellular fluid
3536,the results of the study suggest that changes in renal function are due not to a higher secretion of prostaglandins in nocturnal enuresis but to the relative dominance of their effect as compared with other physiologically active substances that simultaneously act on renal tubular cells
3537,the progestin and oestrogen component of oral contraceptives have been involved in the development of venous thromboembolic events in women
3538,in the present study we determined the vasoactive effects of sex steroids used in oral contraceptives in isolated preconstricted rabbit jugular veins in the presence of diclofenac and examined the underlying mechanisms
3539,the natural hormone progesterone the synthetic progestins levonorgestrel keto desogestrel gestodene and chlormadinone acetate and the synthetic estrogen alpha ethinyloestradiol induced concentration dependent relaxations of endothelium intact veins constricted with u
3540,levonorgestrel also inhibited constrictions evoked by either a high potassium k solution or phorbol myristate acetate pma in the absence and presence of extracellular calcium ca
3541,in addition levonorgestrel depressed contractions evoked by ca and reduced ca influx in depolarized veins
3542,relaxations to levonorgestrel in u constricted veins were neither affected by the presence of the endothelium nor by the inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase ns but were significantly improved either by the selective cyclic amp phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram or in the absence of diclofenac and decreased by the protein kinase a inhibitor rp cpt camps
3543,rolipram also potentiated relaxations to levonorgestrel in pma constricted veins in the presence but not in the absence of extracellular ca
3544,levonorgestrel increased levels of cyclic amp and inhibited pma induced activation of protein kinase c in veins
3545,these findings indicate that levonorgestrel caused endothelium independent relaxations of jugular veins via inhibition of ca entry and of protein kinase c activation
3546,in addition the cyclic amp effector pathway contributes to the levonorgestrel induced relaxation possibly by depressing ca entry
3547,it is not known whether nonselective and cyclooxygenase cox selective nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids differ in terms of hyperkalemia risk
3548,the aim of this study was to compare the differential risk of hyperkalemia associated with various nsaids
3549,nested case control study
3550,new nsaid users receiving care in the us department of veterans affairs va health care system from october to september predictor of factor different nsaids ordered by cox selectivity
3551,risk of hyperkalemia defined as first serum potassium value meq l was estimated with a multivariate conditional logistic model adjusting for age race morbidities medications and contrast media
3552,we identified cases of hyperkalemia and matched controls
3553,risk of hyperkalemia did not differ in patients using a single nsaid adjusted or ci or or more nsaids or ci compared with patients no longer using an nsaid
3554,however risk varied by specific nsaid and elevated risks were found for use of rofecoxib celecoxib diclofenac and indomethacin but not meloxicam etodolac piroxicam sulindac ibuprofen naproxen and ketorolac
3555,interactions were found between nsaid use and exposure to renin angiotensin blockers and contrast media
3556,some nsaids are available over the counter and women are under represented in the va population
3557,nsaids may not by themselves carry a higher risk of moderate to severe hyperkalemia
3558,certain nsaids may increase the risk of hyperkalemia but it is not related to cox selectivity of the nsaid and may depend on concurrent exposure to other agents
3559,the aim was to study the effects of supplementation of rat chow diet with whey mineral concentrate whey a diet rich in milk minerals on arterial responses in vitro in mineralocorticoid nacl hypertension
3560,forty young wistar rats were allocated to four groups wistar whey wistar deoxycorticosterone doc and whey doc
3561,doc mg kg s c was given twice a week and these rats drank nacl solution while the others received equal volumes of vehicle sesame oil and drank tap water
3562,the supplementation was performed by adding whey mineral concentrate to the chow which in particular increased the intake of potassium and also that of calcium and magnesium in the rats
3563,responses of mesenteric arterial rings were examined in standard organ chambers after study weeks
3564,during the week study the doc nacl treatment had a marked hypertensive effect in rats while the whey mineral supplementation was without significant effect on blood pressure in the whey doc and whey wistar groups
3565,arterial relaxation induced by nitroprusside was attenuated in the doc treated rats but was significantly shifted towards that of controls in the whey doc group
3566,interestingly endothelium dependent relaxation to acetylcholine ach which was clearly impaired in the doc group was comparable in the whey doc and wistar groups
3567,moreover only in the doc group the relaxation was improved by diclofenac suggesting that ach was releasing cyclo oxygenase derived contractile factors from the endothelium and the response was completely abolished by ng nitro l arginine methyl ester l name
3568,in contrast diclofenac had a negligible effect on the response in the other groups which also showed distinct relaxations to ach in the presence of l name
3569,this remaining response to ach in wistar rats was inhibited by the addition of apamin and glibenclamide inhibitors of calcium activated and atp sensitive potassium channels respectively suggesting that it was mediated by endothelium dependent hyperpolarization
3570,in the whey wistar group arterial function did not differ from control wistars
3571,supplementation with whey mineral concentrate had a protective effect on endothelium mediated control of arterial tone in experimental doc nacl hypertension
3572,the case of a year old fisherman who presented in a rural clinic with a sudden onset of painful penile swelling affecting the left lateral side with associated rapid detumescence is reported
3573,he had tried to coerce his wife to a sexual intercourse when she forcefully bent his penis
3574,he was initially managed with cold applications oral diclofenac potassium chymoral and splinting of the penis and then referred to the urological services of a teaching hospital
3575,he defaulted only to re present about weeks later with some improvement in his symptoms
3576,further advice to see the urologist was also rebuffed on financial grounds
3577,when he reported about month later he was assessed to have grade erectile dysfunction
3578,in conclusion penile fracture is a rare condition which follows unphysiological bending of the tumescent penis during sexual intercourse or masturbation
3579,that following husband abuse is rarer
3580,the sequelae can be devastating
3581,the aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids on post operative renal function
3582,eight randomized placebo controlled double blinded trials n were identified from searches of medline embase and the cochrane controlled trials register databases
3583,the summary effect size and confidence intervals ci were calculated by a weighted mean difference analysis using a random effects model
3584,the nsaids diclofenac ketorolac indomethacin ibuprofen were used for up to three days after surgery
3585,there were no reported cases of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis
3586,nsaids reduced creatinine clearance by ml min ci to sodium output by mmol day ci to and potassium output by mmol day ci to on day but not on day serum creatinine increased on day by mumol l ci to
3587,urine volume did not change significantly at any time
3588,there was therefore a clinically unimportant transient reduction in renal function
3589,nsaids should not be withheld from patients with normal preoperative renal function because of concerns about postoperative renal impairment
3590,a case of severe bradycardia and hypotension associated with concomitant tizanidine and lisinopril therapy is reported
3591,an year old man with a chief complaint of profound weakness was admitted to the hospital with a blood pressure reading of mm hg and a heart rate of beats min
3592,his medical history included type diabetes mellitus congestive heart failure gastroesophageal reflux disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease osteoarthritis restless leg syndrome benign prostatic hyperplasia generalized anxiety disorder with depression and severe chronic back pain for which he was receiving treatment at a pain clinic
3593,two days before hospital admission he had been seen at the pain clinic and started on ti zanidine
3594,additional medications included acetaminophen chlorpromazine citalopram finasteride lidocaine patch lisinopril metformin pramipexole omeprazole simvastatin theophylline diclofenac topical gel hydrocodone acetaminophen and ondansetron
3595,after taking three doses of the newly prescribed tizanidine he developed severe hypotension and bradycardia
3596,notable laboratory test values included a serum creatinine concentration of mg dl a blood urea nitrogen concentration of mg dl a serum potassium concentration of meq l and a serum sodium concentration of meq l
3597,upon admission tizanidine lisinopril theophylline omeprazole and simvastatin were withheld and i v
3598,fluids were administered
3599,the patient s vital signs began to gradually improve
3600,within hours the patient s blood pressure and heart rate had improved as had the previously abnormal laboratory test values
3601,tizanidine was discontinued and all of his other preadmission medications were restarted at discharge
3602,the addition of tizanidine in a patient receiving long term treatment with lisinopril was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia
3603,angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibition has been shown to restore impaired endothelial function in hypertension but the roles of different mediators in enhanced endothelium dependent dilation have not been fully characterized
3604,the effects of ace inhibition with ramipril mg kg day on relaxation responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats shr and normotensive wistar kyoto rats wky
3605,the week long therapy effectively reduced blood pressure in shr
3606,in noradrenaline na precontracted arterial rings endothelium dependent relaxations to acetylcholine ach as well as endothelium independent dilations to isoprenaline and nitroprusside were more pronounced in wky and ramipril treated shr than in untreated shr
3607,the cyclo oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac which reduces the synthesis of dilating and constricting prostanoids clearly enhanced the relaxation to ach in untreated shr but was without effect in the other groups
3608,the nitric oxide no synthase inhibitor n g nitro l arginine methyl ester l name attenuated the relaxations to ach more effectively in untreated shr than in the ramipril shr and wky groups
3609,however when endothelium dependent hyperpolarization was prevented by precontracting the preparations with potassium chloride kcl no significant differences were found in relaxations to ach between the study groups
3610,in addition in na precontracted rings the diclofenac and l name resistant relaxations to ach were partially prevented by glibenclamide and apamin inhibitors of atp dependent and ca activated k channels respectively
3611,long term ace inhibition normalized blood pressure and enhanced arterial dilation in shr
3612,the improved endothelium mediated relaxation following ramipril therapy could be attributed to reduced release of cyclo oxygenase derived constricting factors and augmented endothelium dependent hyperpolarization in this type of experimental hypertension
3613,several lines of evidence suggest that both volatile and intravenous anaesthetics may interfere with the synthesis and release of endothelium derived vasoactive factors
3614,we have investigated the effects of three different barbiturates on the release of nitric oxide no and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor edhf in phenylephrine microm preconstricted endothelium intact ring segments of the rabbit carotid artery
3615,the segments were pretreated with the cyclo oxygenase inhibitor diclofenac microm to prevent the formation of vasoactive prostanoids such as prostacyclin pgi
3616,acetylcholine ach elicited a concentration dependent relaxation ec microm in control segments which was not significantly different from the relaxant responses of segments pretreated with methohexitone mm phenobarbitone mm or thiopentone mm
3617,inhibition of no synthesis with ng nitro l arginine mm significantly reduced the maximum relaxant response to ach from to
3618,this no pgi independent relaxation appeared to be mediated by the release of edhf since it was strongly diminished in the presence of the k ca inhibitors tetrabutylammonium mm and charybdotoxin nm following preconstriction with potassium calcium mm or removal of the endothelium
3619,thiopentone or methohexitone markedly attenuated the edhf mediated relaxant response to ach while phenobarbitone had no effect
3620,the endothelium independent relaxation elicited by sodium nitroprusside microm on the other hand was only marginally affected by these anaesthetics
3621,the cytochrome p inhibitor clotrimazole microm mimicked the inhibitory effect of thiopentone and methohexitone on the no pgi independent relaxant response to ach
3622,moreover the cytochrome p catalyzed o dealkylation of ethoxycoumarin by rabbit liver microsomes was inhibited in the presence of thiopentone or methohexitone mm while phenobarbitone was without effect
3623,these findings suggest that thiopentone and methohexitone selectively attenuate the edhf mediated relaxant response to ach in the rabbit carotid artery presumably by interfering with its synthesis from arachidonic acid via the cytochrome p epoxygenase pathway
3624,the interaction of superoxide anions o generated by menadione with the synthesis and or action of nitric oxide no prostacyclin pgi and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor edhf was investigated in segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery lad isolated from bovine hearts
3625,edhf and no release were monitored by superfusion bioassay in segments pre constricted with the thromboxane mimetic u pgi release in addition by enzyme immunoassay for keto prostaglandin falpha and generation of o by lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence
3626,bradykinin pmol elicited a prominent endothelium dependent relaxant response of which was insensitive to combined blockade of cyclooxygenase with diclofenac microm and no synthase with ng nitro l arginine microm
3627,this diclofenac ng nitro l arginine insensitive relaxant response was completely abrogated in the presence of tetrabutylammonium mm a non selective inhibitor of ca dependent k channels or when the segments were pre constricted with potassium chloride mm instead of u and thus most likely mediated by edhf
3628,despite causing a two to fourfold increase in the concentration of o in or at the vessel wall menadione microm did not affect the diclofenac ng nitro l arginine insensitive relaxant response to bradykinin
3629,when administered in the absence of ng nitro l arginine however menadione significantly inhibited the relaxant response to bradykinin presumably by attenuating the no mediated relaxation
3630,menadione also abolished the bradykinin stimulated release of pgi from luminally perfused segments of the lad
3631,this effect was more pronounced in the absence of ng nitro l arginine indicating that pgi release in this preparation may be more sensitive to inhibition by peroxynitrite the reaction product of no and o than to o alone
3632,these findings suggest that in contrast to no and pgi the release and presumably also the mechanism of action of edhf in the bovine lad is resistant to an increase in the local concentration of o or peroxynitrite which is thought to play an important role in coronary heart disease
3633,celecoxib rofecoxib and diclofenac are clinically used cyclooxygenase cox inhibitors which have been under intense scrutiny because long term rofecoxib vioxx merck whitehouse station nj treatment was found to increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events
3634,a differential risk profile for these drugs has emerged but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated
3635,we investigated the effects of celecoxib rofecoxib and diclofenac on ionic currents and calcium signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs using patch clamp techniques and fura fluorescence and on arterial constriction using pressure myography
3636,celecoxib but not rofecoxib or diclofenac dramatically enhanced kcnq k v potassium currents and suppressed l type voltage sensitive calcium currents in ar rat aortic smooth muscle cells native kcnq currents or overexpressed human kcnq currents and freshly isolated rat mesenteric artery myocytes
3637,the effects of celecoxib were concentration dependent within the therapeutic concentration range and were reversed on washout
3638,celecoxib but not rofecoxib also inhibited calcium responses to vasopressin in ar cells and dilated intact or endothelium denuded rat mesenteric arteries
3639,a celecoxib analog dimethyl celecoxib which does not inhibit cox mimicked celecoxib in its enhancement of vascular kcnq currents suppression of l type calcium currents and vasodilation
3640,we conclude that celecoxib inhibits calcium responses in vsmcs by enhancing kcnq currents and suppressing l type calcium currents which ultimately reduces vascular tone
3641,these effects are independent of its cox inhibitory actions and may explain the differential risk of cardiovascular events in patients taking different drugs of this class
3642,microporous bilayer osmotic tablet bearing dicyclomine hydrochloride and diclofenac potassium was developed using a new oral drug delivery system for colon targeting
3643,the tablets were coated with microporous semipermeable membrane and enteric polymer using conventional pan coating process
3644,the developed microporous bilayer osmotic pump tablet opt did not require laser drilling to form the drug delivery orifice
3645,the colon specific biodegradation of pectin could form in situ delivery pores for drug release
3646,the effect of formulation variables like inclusion of osmogen amount of hpmc and nacmc in core amount of pore former in semipermeable membrane was studied
3647,scanning electron microscopic photographs showed formation of in situ delivery pores after predetermined time of coming in contact with dissolution medium
3648,the number of pores was dependent on the amount of the pore former in the semipermeable membrane
3649,in vitro dissolution results indicated that system showed acid resistant timed release and was able to deliver drug at an approximate zero order up to h
3650,the developed tablets could be effectively used for colon specific drug delivery to treat ibs
3651,the present study examined the involvement of prostaglandins pgs in the mechanisms of acth and beta endorphin release from rat anterior pituitary quarters incubated in vitro
3652,various cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin diclofenac flurbiprofen had no effect on basal release of acth like or beta endorphin like immunoreactivity beta ei but enhanced acth immunoreactivity beta ei release upon stimulation by arginine vasopressin avp or synthetic ovine corticotropin releasing factor crf
3653,the lowest effective concentration of indomethacin was just sufficient to prevent pg synthesis
3654,indomethacin was similarly active after blockade of the phosphodiesterase by isobutyl methylxanthine
3655,when added to the incubation media in concentrations up to microm pge d f alpha or prostacyclin pgi did not alter basal beta ei release however with stimulation by avp or crf pge but not pgd f alpha or i inhibited beta ei release by about
3656,the concentrations of pge in the incubation media as measured by ria were somewhat higher than those of any other cyclooxygenase product pgd f alpha keto pgf alpha thromboxane b
3657,upon stimulation by avp or crf the concentrations of pge increased whereas those of pgd or f alpha remained unchanged
3658,the release of beta ei stimulated by high potassium concentration was not enhanced by indomethacin although this release was sensitive to inhibition by pge
3659,we conclude that pge is formed locally subsequent to binding of the neurohormones and may act as a negative feedback modulator of vasopressin s and crf s activity in the anterior pituitary gland
3660,to assess whether vaginal misoprostol or oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids reduce pain during and minutes after hysterosalpingography hsg
3661,randomized prospective controlled parallel group study canadian task force classification i
3662,university teaching hospital
3663,one hundred sixty eight women with primary infertility who underwent hsg for evaluation of infertility
3664,patients were randomly assigned to of groups
3665,group received g misoprostol vaginally hours before hsg group mg diclofenac potassium orally to minutes before hsg and group no medication
3666,the primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the severity of pain during and minutes after the procedure using a visual analog scale vas ranging from very favorable to very unfavorable
3667,the secondary outcomes were to assess the rate of completion and the vasovagal effects including nausea vomiting sweating weakness syncope hypotension and bradycardia
3668,there was no statistically significant difference in the median vas pain scores between women administered vaginal misoprostol median cm range cm and the control group median cm range cm during the hsg
3669,however women in the nsaid group median cm range cm reported less pain than did those in the misoprostol group p and the control group p
3670,at minutes after hsg there was no significant difference in the median vas pain scores between patients administered nsaids median cm range or misoprostol median cm range and the control group median cm range
3671,there is no benefit in terms of pain reduction with the use of misoprostol during hsg or at minutes after the procedure
3672,however nsaids are associated with pain relief during the hsg procedure
3673,cholinergic modulation of spontaneous gabaergic currents mipsc was studied using whole cell patch methods in mouse accessory olfactory bulb slices
3674,carbachol above microm administration produced an increase in the mipsc frequency in mitral cells but did not affect the responses of mitral cells to gaba
3675,the carbachol effect persisted in the presence of combined ionotropic and metabotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonists
3676,the carbachol effect was reduced by the muscarinic receptor type and m and m antagonist pirenzepine microm but not by the m and m antagonist himbacine microm
3677,the kcnq kv potassium channel openers retigabine microm and diclofenac microm blocked the carbachol action while the kcnq potassium channel blocker xe microm increased the mipsc frequency
3678,xe s action persisted in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers
3679,in the presence of carbachol mipscs were abolished by ni microm while being insensitive to the calcium channel blocker nimodipine microm suggesting a role for r type calcium channels in the gaba release
3680,these results suggest that carbachol closed kcnq channels by stimulating m receptors on granule cell dendrites and the resulting depolarized and unstable membrane promoted calcium influx thus increasing the gaba release
3681,the possible role of acetylcholine in facilitating formation of a pheromone memory in mice is also discussed
3682,hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc is now available in modified hydrophobic forms sangelose
3683,in this paper the effect of viscosity grade and hpmc concentration on in vitro release kinetics of a topically applied drug were studied using gel formulations of a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac potassium dp with different viscosity grades of the polymer l m m for hydrophobic hpmc and cps for conventional hydrophilic hpmc in different proportions
3684,it was found that hydrophobic hpmc based gels having a higher viscosity and lower polymer concentration release a notably higher amount of drug compared with hydrophilic hpmc based gels containing a higher concentration of polymer but with lower viscosity
3685,for gels the suitability of different common empirical zero order first order and higuchi and semi empirical ritger peppas and peppas sahlin models and some new statistical logistic log logistic weibull gumbel and generalized extreme value distribution models to describe the drug release profile were tested through non linear least square curve fitting
3686,a general purpose mathematical analysis tool matlab was used
3687,further instead of the widely used transformed linear fit method direct fitting was used in the paper to avoid any form of truncation and transformation errors
3688,the results revealed that the log logistic distribution amongst all the models investigated was the best fit for hydrophobic formulations
3689,for hydrophilic ones the semi empirical models and weibull distribution worked best although log logistic also showed a close fit
3690,the shape parameter for the log logistic and weibull distribution conveys vital information about the rate of release and helps improve understanding of drug release profiles
3691,the goal of this work was to evaluate the suitability of wet granulation as an innovative and fast method for the preparation of granules containing a drug resin complex resinate having cholestyramine as resin and potassium diclofenac kd as drug
3692,resinate and granules were prepared directly by steam granulation in high shear mixer method a using two different amount of resin granules and
3693,for comparison granules were also prepared by conventional batch method followed by steam granulation method b
3694,all granules showed quite irregular shape main size fractions between and microm good flowability and uniform kd distribution
3695,granules a exhibited controlled release profiles at ph while granules a showed a burst effect due to kd free crystals
3696,ft ir studies confirmed the complete complexation between resin and kd during the granulation process with method a for granules finally the dissolution test of granules a in different media revealed a controlled drug release in h providing the utility of this system for enteric drug delivery
3697,granules b evidenced similar characteristics to those of granules a the drawback of the multistep procedure was related to the long processing time
3698,chronic renal failure is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and abnormal arterial tone but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood
3699,therefore we studied the responses of isolated mesenteric arterial rings from wistar kyoto rats in standard organ chambers wk after subtotal nephrectomy or sham operation
3700,subtotal nephrectomy resulted in a fold elevation of plasma urea nitrogen whereas blood pressure was not significantly affected
3701,endothelium mediated relaxations of norepinephrine precontracted rings to ach were impaired in renal failure rats
3702,the nitric oxide no synthase inhibitor n g nitro l arginine methyl ester inhibited relaxations to ach more effectively in the renal failure group whereas the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac did not significantly affect the response in either group
3703,inhibition of ca activated k channels by charybdotoxin and apamin attenuated no synthase and cyclooxygenase resistant relaxations to ach in control but not renal failure rats and abolished the difference between these groups
3704,endothelium independent relaxations to isoproterenol and cromakalim vasodilators acting via beta adrenoceptors and atp sensitive k channels respectively were impaired in the renal failure group whereas relaxations to the no donor nitroprusside were similar in both groups
3705,in conclusion endothelium mediated relaxation in renal failure rats was impaired in the absence and presence of no synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibition but not with prevented smooth muscle hyperpolarization
3706,endothelium independent relaxations to isoproterenol and cromakalim were also attenuated after nephrectomy
3707,these results suggest that impaired vasodilatation in experimental renal failure could be attributed to reduced relaxation via arterial k channels
3708,an analytical method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps including antibiotics trimethoprim erythromycin x ho norfloxacin ofloxacin pencilline g penicillin v potassium salt cephalexin and sulfamethoxazole beta bloker atenolol anophelifuge n n diethyl methylbenzoylamide deet antiepileptics carbamazepine central nervous system stimulant caffeine lipid modifying agent clofibric acid non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs ibuprofen naproxen and diclofenac sodium salt and antimicrobial agents triclosan and triclocarban
3709,the detection and qualification of the target compounds were performed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
3710,the optimized mobile phases were methanol as organic phase
3711,v v formic acid mmol l ammonium acetate for positive electrospray ionization esi and mmol l ammonium acetate for esi as inorganic phase
3712,water samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction at ml min and all the target ppcps were efficiently extracted at ph the extracted ppcps were eluted by the mixture of methanol and acetonitrile v v
3713,the average recoveries of the target compounds in the spiked pure water samples ranged from
3714,the average recoveries of the target compounds ranged from with the relative standard deviations ranged from in the surface water samples spiked at ng l
3715,the surface water samples collected from yu hangtang river in hangzhou were detected
3716,the results showed that nine ppcps were detected including caffeine that reached a maximum concentration of ng l
3717,it proved that this analytical method is reliable and acceptable
3718,the mechanisms underlying the adaptive process in the remaining kidney after unilateral nephrectomy are not well known
3719,in the present study adaptive changes in interstitial pressure conditions following uninephrectomy were investigated in male sprague dawley rats
3720,direct subcapsular hydrostatic pressure recordings were made via microcatheters renal lymph was collected for lymph flow rate estimations and determinations of lymph protein content and the urine flow rate and urinary excretion of sodium and potassium were measured before and after contralateral nephrectomy
3721,there was a significant rise in subcapsular hydrostatic pressure by about and in the lymph flow rate by more than within hr after nephrectomy
3722,the protein concentration in collected renal lymph was significantly decreased from to g dl compared with control collections in sham operated animals from to g dl
3723,these findings indicate an increased hydrostatic and decreased intersititial pressure in response to contralateral nephrectomy
3724,urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion were significantly elevated urine flow rate by sodium excretion from to mumoles min and potassium excretion from to mumoles min
3725,inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prior to nephrectomy abolished the lymph flow increase and oncotic pressure decrease and also the diuretic and natriuretic responses
3726,the adaptively increased potassium excretion was however only blocked by diclofenac sodium and not by indomethacin
3727,these results demonstrate the important role of the renal interstitium and the prostaglandin system in the renal adaptation to nephron loss
3728,in addition to nitric oxide no and prostacyclin pgi an as yet unidentified endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor edhf contributes to the dilator effect of bradykinin in different vascular beds
3729,we have investigated the nature and mechanism of action of this factor in freshly isolated bovine and porcine coronary artery segments which were preconstricted with the thromboxane mimetic u dideoxy alpha alpha epoxymethano prostaglandin f alpha nm
3730,the concentration response curve of bradykinin was significantly shifted to the right after inhibition of no synthesis with ng nitro l arginine l nna microm whereas cyclo oxygenase blockade with diclofenac microm had no effect
3731,preconstriction of the segments with potassium chloride mm completely abrogated the no pgi independent dilator response to bradykinin
3732,in sandwich bioassay experiments both the luminal and abluminal release of no but not that of edhf was readily detectable
3733,inhibitors of ca activated k channels k ca such as apamin microm and tetrabutylammonium tba mm strongly attenuated the edhf mediated bradykinin induced relaxation while glibenclamide microm an inhibitor of k atp channels had no effect
3734,these relaxations were also significantly inhibited by the phospholipase a inhibitor quinacrine microm and the cytochrome p inhibitors skfa microm and clotrimazole microm
3735,moreover incubation of endothelium denuded coronary artery rings with a cytochrome p derived arachidonic acid metabolite epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid elicited a concentration dependent microm dilatation which was abolished both in the presence of tba mm and following preconstriction of the segments with potassium chloride instead of u
3736,abstract truncated at words
3737,lactoferrin lf is a multifunctional protein that is found in milk neutrophils and other biological fluids
3738,under inflammatory conditions lf production is increased in the periphery by neutrophils
3739,however the cardiovascular function of lf is still unknown
3740,in the present study we investigated the effect of bovine lf blf on the mean blood pressure mbp and heart rate hr in urethane anesthetized rats and the vascular function of blf in the rat thoracic aorta
3741,intravenous injection of blf produced dose dependent decreases in mbp but did not affect hr while the opioid agonist morphine decreased both mbp and hr
3742,the hypotensive effect of blf was not altered by naloxone methiodide which cannot pass through the blood brain barrier but was significantly reduced by naloxone hydrochloride which does pass through the blood brain barrier
3743,blf induced hypotension was completely blocked by the no synthase inhibitor ng nitro l arginine methyl ester l name but not by the inactive enantiomer of l name ng nitro d arginine methyl ester d name
3744,blf induced hypotension was not altered by the muscarinic ach receptor antagonist atropine or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac
3745,blf produced relaxation in endothelium intact but not endothelium denuded aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine
3746,the relaxation evoked by blf was completely blocked by l name but not by d name or the atp sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide
3747,these results suggest that blf causes hypotension via an endothelium dependent vasodilation that is strongly mediated by no production and that blf induced hypotension also may be mediated by the central opioidergic system
3748,the main issue in the development of transdermal patches made of poly ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate eudragit ne d pmm is the shrinkage phenomenon during the spreading of the latex onto the release liner
3749,to solve this problem the latex is usually freeze dried and then re dissolved in an organic solvent method
3750,to simplify the production process we prepared an adhesive matrix by adding to the commercial pmm latex a plasticizer and an additive anti shrinkage agent that avoids the shrinkage of the water dispersion spread onto the release liner method
3751,in some cases the active ingredient itself such as potassium diclofenac dk and nicotine nt works as anti shrinkage agent
3752,in this work the effects of the preparation method types and concentrations of the plasticizer triacetin and tributyl citrate on the adhesive properties of the transdermal patches were investigated
3753,the adhesive properties of the prepared patch were determined by texture analysis peel adhesion test and shear adhesion
3754,the pmm plasticizer interactions were evaluated by atr ftir spectroscopy
3755,furthermore the in vitro skin permeation profiles of dk and nt released from the patch were determined by franz cell method
3756,generally speaking the variables that mainly modify the adhesive properties are the concentration and type of the plasticizer
3757,the skin permeation profiles of dk and nt from the patch prepared by method overlapped with those obtained with the commercial products
3758,the results underline that the pmm latex can be used conveniently in the development of transdermal patches
3759,the contractile activity of bay k was assessed in rat isolated aortic ring preparations bathed in a potassium free medium
3760,bay k microm caused extracellular calcium dependent contractile responses which were significantly greater in tissues with than deprived of a functional endothelium
3761,in preparations with an endothelium the contraction was attenuated by quinacrine microm indomethacin microm and diclofenac microm but not changed by nordihydroguaiaretic acid microm or dazoxiben microm
3762,thus in the rat aorta bathed in k free medium bay k can cause contractile effects apparently due to the release of an endothelium derived contractant factor edcf which is proposed to be a cyclo oxygenase product
3763,the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of long term ethanol consumption on arterial responses in vitro in young and aged rats
3764,therefore wistar rats ages and mo respectively were allocated to six groups control young sucrose young ethanol young control aged sucrose aged and ethanol aged
3765,the ethanol fed groups were given ethanol by intragastric gavage three times a day days a week
3766,responses of mesenteric arterial rings were examined in standard organ chambers after treatment weeks
3767,in norepinephrine precontracted arterial rings endothelium dependent relaxations to acetylcholine as well as endothelium independent relaxations to isoproterenol were attenuated in aged rats when compared with young controls
3768,relaxation responses to isoproterenol but not to acetylcholine and nitroprusside were clearly improved by ethanol treatment in both young and aged rats
3769,the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac which reduces the synthesis of dilating and constricting prostanoids enhanced the relaxation to acetylcholine in all three aged rat groups but was without significant effect in the young rats
3770,in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ng nitro l arginine methyl ester the relaxation to acetylcholine in control and sucrose fed aged rats was markedly reduced compared with control rats whereas in the young controls and in both young and aged ethanol exposed groups distinct relaxations to higher concentrations of acetylcholine were still present
3771,the endothelium independent relaxations to cromakalim a hyperpolarizing vasodilator acting via atp sensitive potassium channels were also markedly augmented by ethanol feeding in both young and aged rats
3772,in conclusion ethanol consumption in both young and aged rats was associated with markedly improved arterial relaxations to isoproterenol and cromakalim as well as clearly augmented relaxation to acetylcholine during inhibition of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase
3773,these findings suggest that especially the potassium channel related component of arterial relaxation was augmented by long term ethanol exposure
3774,toxicity testing is vital to protect human health from exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment
3775,furthermore combining novel cellular models with molecular profiling technologies such as metabolomics can add new insight into the molecular basis of toxicity and provide a rich source of biomarkers that are urgently required in a st century approach to toxicology
3776,we have used an nmr based metabolic profiling approach to characterise for the first time the metabolome of the rptec tert cell line an immortalised non tumour human renal epithelial cell line that recapitulates phenotypic characteristics that are absent in other in vitro renal cell models
3777,rptec tert cells were cultured with either the dosing vehicle dmso or with exposure to one of six compounds nifedipine potassium bromate monuron d mannitol ochratoxin a and sodium diclofenac several of which are known to cause renal effects
3778,aqueous intracellular and culture media metabolites were profiled by h nmr spectroscopy at and hours of exposure to a low effect dose ic
3779,we defined the metabolome of the rptec tert cell line and used a principal component analysis approach to derive a panel of key metabolites which were altered by chemical exposure
3780,by considering only major changes fold change from control across this metabolite panel we were able to show specific alterations to cellular processes associated with chemical treatment
3781,our findings suggest that metabolic profiling of rptec tert cells can report on the effect of chemical exposure on multiple cellular pathways at low level exposure producing different response profiles for the different compounds tested with a greater number of major metabolic effects observed in the toxin treated cells
3782,importantly compounds with established links to chronic renal toxicity produced more diverse and severe perturbations to the cellular metabolome than non toxic compounds in this model
3783,as these changes can be rationalised with the different pharmacological and toxicity profiles of the chemicals it is suggested that metabolic profiling in the rptec tert model would be useful in investigating the mechanism of action of toxins at a low dose
3784,the present study was undertaken to determine whether trandolaprilat an active form of angiotensin i converting enzyme ace inhibitor may improve ischemia reperfusion induced contractile dysfunction and metabolic derangement of isolated rat hearts
3785,ischemia min and subsequent min reperfusion resulted in a small recovery of post ischemic left ventricular developed pressure lvdp a sustained increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure an increase in the release of creatine kinase and atp metabolites from the perfused heart and changes in myocardial sodium potassium calcium and magnesium contents
3786,treatment with microm of trandolaprilat for the last min of pre ischemia recovered approximately of pre ischemic lvdp during reperfusion whereas that with microm of enalaprilat restored approximately of the pre ischemic lvdp
3787,treatment with either trandolaprilat or enalaprilat at these concentrations attenuated the release of creatine kinase and atp metabolites into the perfusate during reperfusion
3788,treatment with microm trandolaprilat suppressed ischemia reperfusion induced changes in myocardial ion content
3789,treatment with bradykinin during the last min of pre ischemia also resulted in a post ischemic contractile recovery with a degree similar to that of the trandolaprilat treated hearts
3790,e an at antagonist showed no effect on ischemia reperfusion induced changes in cardiac parameters
3791,the enhancement of post ischemic contractile recovery by the ace inhibitor was abolished by treatment with either hoechst a bradykinin bk antagonist or diclofenac a cyclooxygenase inhibitor
3792,these results suggest that trandolaprilat is capable of attenuating ischemia reperfusion injury of isolated perfused hearts and altered bk metabolism is at least in part involved in this effect
3793,bone formation is essential to orthodontic tooth movement and bone is formed by collagen
3794,to analyze the collagen maturation process on bone matrix neoformed under nonsteroidal and steroidal treatment during orthodontic tooth movement by polarized microscopy male wistar rats n were randomly divided into three groups n c control nsaid potassium diclofenac and said disodic phosphate dexamethasone
3795,the animals of the c group received saline solution nsaid group received mg kg potassium diclofenac cataflam and said group received mg kg phosphate dissodic dexamethasone dexanil
3796,animals were sacrificed or days after the placement of orthodontic appliances and the upper first molars were processed histologically and stained with picrosirius
3797,bone formation was evaluated under polarized light microscopy and image pro plus software calculated the percentage of immature mature collagen present in the groups
3798,on the third days after force application said and nsaid groups showed greater proportion of immature collagen than c group
3799,on the seventh and fourteenth days there was a lower proportion of mature collagen only in the said group p
3800,these data demonstrate that dexamethasone delays the collagen maturation process in established bone matrix
3801,we have treated patients suffering from kala azar in brazil with amphocil amphotericin b cholesterol dispersion at a dose of mg kg d for d following an earlier study in which this dosage for d was found to cure all of patients with no relapse during months
3802,in the present study all patients demonstrated initial resolution of disease
3803,parasites were absent upon bone marrow re aspiration weeks after therapy no spleen extended beyond the costal margin months after therapy white blood cell counts platelet counts and serum levels of albumin rapidly returned to normal
3804,although one patient relapsed at months of the other patients had spleens of normal size undetectable on deep palpation at months after therapy
3805,fever sometimes accompanied by increased respiratory rate occurred on the first day of drug infusion in of patients and was more severe in patients years old
3806,pre medication with a non steroidal anti inflammatory agent diclofenac potassium before the next infusions protected against this side effect in of patients
3807,the results of this and our previous study suggest that the most appropriate regimen of amphocil for kala azar is mg kg d for d with pre medication each day in patients aged years
3808,the performance of a glassy carbon electrode modified with a porphyrin film formed by the co tpyp ru bipy cl tfms h o complex for the analysis of sodium metabisulfite in pharmaceuticals is described
3809,the sensor can be rapidly and easily prepared by drop casting of a microliter volume of a diluted methanolic solution of the complex onto the electrode surface
3810,the modified electrode with a supramolecular cobalt porphyrin film led to more favorable responses than the bare electrode
3811,this can be ascribed to the much faster electron transfer processes to the analyte mediated by the tetraruthenated porphyrin and to the protection of the electrode against fouling
3812,the association of the amperometric sensor with the batch injection analysis technique led to results that combine good repeatability of the current responses relative standard deviation of for measurements wide linear dynamic range x moll to x moll high sensitivity and low limits of detection x moll and quantification x moll
3813,the system was successfully applied to sodium metabisulfite quantification in commercial samples of injection formulations of sodium or potassium diclofenac
3814,the results compared well with those obtained by the polarographic method
3815,alpha lactorphin tyr gly leu phe lowers blood pressure in conscious adult shr
3816,this tetrapeptide is originally released from milk protein alpha lactalbumin by enzymatic hydrolysis
3817,in order to evaluate the antihypertensive mechanisms of alpha lactorphin the effects of the tetrapeptide on vascular function were investigated in weeks old spontaneously hypertensive rats shr with established hypertension and age matched normotensive wistar kyoto wky rats in vitro
3818,in addition we studied the vascular effects of another structurally related tetrapeptide beta lactorphin tyr leu leu phe which originates from milk protein beta lactoglobulin
3819,endothelium dependent relaxation to acetylcholine ach was reduced in mesenteric arterial preparations of shr as compared to those of wky
3820,in shr the ach induced relaxation was augmented by alpha lactorphin or beta lactorphin
3821,the role of nitric oxide no is suggested since this improvement was abolished by the no synthase nos inhibitor n g nitro l arginine methyl ester l name
3822,simultaneous potassium channel inhibitor tetraethylammonium tea elicited no additional effect on the ach induced relaxation
3823,the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac did not attenuate the augmented ach relaxation induced by alpha lactorphin or beta lactorphin suggesting that endothelial vasodilatory prostanoids were not involved in the effect of the tetrapeptides
3824,endothelium independent relaxation to the no donor sodium nitroprusside snp was augmented in mesenteric arterial preparations of shr by simultaneous beta lactorphin
3825,the tetrapeptides did not alter vascular responses in mesenteric arteries from wky
3826,in conclusion both alpha lactorphin and beta lactorphin improved vascular relaxation in adult shr in vitro
3827,the beneficial effect of alpha lactorphin was directed towards endothelial function whereas beta lactorphin also enhanced endothelium independent relaxation
3828,the present study evaluated the potential mechanism involved in the hypotensive effect induced by et in rats treated with the no synthase inhibitor ng nitro l arginine methyl ester l name in the drinking water during days
3829,hypertension developed in the l name treated rats versus mm hg in untreated control rats and the hypotensive effect of et pmol kg iv was significantly enhanced compared with control rats versus fall in mean arterial pressure
3830,the enhanced et hypotensive effect in l name treated rats was abolished by the etb receptor antagonist bq but was unaltered by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac the cytochrome p inhibitor fluconazole or the potassium channel blockers apamin glibenclamide tetraethylammonium and aminopyridine
3831,pretreatment with the cannabinoid cb receptor antagonist sra significantly reduced the hypotensive response to et in l name treated rats although it did not modify the response in untreated control rats
3832,these findings indicate that in rats under chronic nos inhibition the hypotensive effect of et is unexpectedly enhanced and appears to be mediated by a non no non prostanoid mechanism and involves an sra sensitive mechanism triggered by etb receptor activation
3833,fluid shear stress elicits endothelium dependent vasodilatation via nitric oxide and prostacyclin dependent and independent mechanisms
3834,the latter includes the opening of ca operated potassium channels by cytochrome p cyp epoxygenase derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids eets leading to endothelial hyperpolarization
3835,we previously reported that eets activate the transient receptor potential trp v channel in vascular endothelial cells and that ca influx in these cells in response to mechanical stimuli is dependent on the activation of cyp epoxygenases
3836,we therefore hypothesized that the trpv channel is involved in the flow induced vasodilatation attributed to the endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor edhf
3837,in the presence of n omega nitro l arginine methyl ester and diclofenac precontracted mouse carotid arteries displayed a considerable vasodilatation in response to step wise increases in luminal flow
3838,the edhf mediated flow induced vasodilatation could be inhibited by the epoxygenase inhibitor ms ppoh was abolished after down regulation of cyp epoxygenases in tissue culture and could be restored by viral expression of cypc in the endothelium
3839,the trpv channel inhibitor ruthenium red rur inhibited the edhf mediated flow response but the combination of ms ppoh and rur had no further effect
3840,rur also inhibited the response in cypc overexpressing vessels
3841,moreover trpv deficient mice demonstrated a blunted edhf mediated response to increases in luminal flow in comparison to their wild type littermates and the addition of ms ppoh was without effect in these mice up to in trpv vs in trpv p
3842,in cultured human endothelial cells exposure to fluid shear stress induced the translocation of the trpv channel from a perinuclear localization to the cell membrane
3843,we conclude that the trpv channel is involved in flow induced endothelium dependent vasodilatation of murine carotid arteries
3844,moreover the activation of the trpv channel by flow requires an active cyp epoxygenase and the translocation of the channel to the cell membrane
3845,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are commonly used medications for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain
3846,selective cyclooxygenase cox inhibitors such as celecoxib celebrex rofecoxib vioxx and diclofenac have been among the most widely prescribed nsaids because they prevent the generation of prostaglandins involved in inflammation and pain but avoid some of the gastrointestinal complications associated with less selective cox cox inhibitors
3847,in rofecoxib vioxx was voluntarily withdrawn from the market because of adverse cardiovascular side effects
3848,this led to an explosion of research into the cardiovascular effects of the coxibs which revealed differential cardiovascular risk profiles among the members of this drug class
3849,the differential risk profiles may relate to the tendency of some of the drugs to elevate blood pressure bp
3850,an important component of bp regulation is dependent on the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs which is controlled to a large extent by the activities of kcnq kv family potassium channels and l type calcium channels
3851,our recently published data indicate that celecoxib but not rofecoxib or diclofenac at therapeutically relevant concentrations acts as a kv potassium channel activator and a calcium channel blocker causing relaxation of vsmcs and decreasing vascular tone
3852,these vasorelaxant ion channel effects may account for the differential cardiovascular risk profiles among the different cox inhibitors
3853,we further speculate that these properties may be exploited for therapeutic benefit in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases or other medical conditions
3854,an year old woman was referred to our emergency department with acute urticaria and sudden shortness of breath approximately min after taking rectal diclofenac potassium for lumbago
3855,after treatment with adrenaline and corticosteroids the patient became hemodynamically stable and left the hospital on the next day
3856,she attended our hospital week after the onset of anaphylaxis because of repeated postprandial epigastric pain
3857,no abnormal lesions were found in endoscopy
3858,radiographic selective catheter angiography revealed chronic mesenteric ischemia caused by atherosclerosis and abundant collateral arteries between the celiac trunk the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery
3859,patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia usually present with a clinical syndrome characterized by painful abdominal cramps and colic occurring typically during the postprandial phase
3860,fear of eating resulted in malnutrition
3861,she was prescribed proton pump inhibitor digestants anticholinergic agents serine protease inhibitors prokinetics antiplatelet agents and transdermal nitroglycerin intermittently but these had no beneficial effects
3862,it was most probable that this patient with chronic atherosclerotic mesenteric ischemia was suffering from functional abdominal pain syndrome induced by anaphylaxis
3863,since psychiatric disorders were associated with alterations in the processing of visceral sensation we facilitated the patient s understanding of functional abdominal pain syndrome with the psychologist
3864,postprandial abdominal pain gradually faded after administration of these drugs and the patient left the hospital
3865,developing a satisfactory patient physician relationship was considered more effective for the management of persistent abdominal pain caused by complicated mechanisms
3866,to assess the effect and safety of pre emptive oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids for the success of inferior alveolar nerve block ianb in irreversible pulpitis treatment
3867,medline via ovid to july cochrane central register of controlled trials central issue embase via ovid to july chinese biomedical literature database to july china national knowledge infrastructure to july and who international clinical trials registry platform were searched electronically
3868,in addition relevant journals as well as reference lists of included studies were hand searched for randomized clinical trials comparing the effect or safety of nsaids in irreversible pulpitis treatment
3869,risk of bias assessment with the cochrane collaboration tool and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers
3870,meta analysis was delivered with revman
3871,seven studies were included
3872,six of them had low risk of bias and one had an unclear risk of bias
3873,a dosage of to mg of ibuprofen showed a significant effect in increasing the success rate of ianb relative risk rr confidence interval ci to p and the results were moderately reliable
3874,a dosage of mg of indomethacin had a significant effect compared to a placebo rr ci to p as did mg of lornoxicam rr ci to p and mg of diclofenac potassium rr ci to p
3875,other nsaids such as ketorolac ibuprofen and acetaminophen together and acetaminophen alone showed no statistical significance compared to the placebo
3876,no serious adverse events were reported
3877,the clinical evidence suggests that pre emptive oral nsaids might have a good effect and are safe in increasing the success rate of ianb but more studies are necessary to confirm such outcomes
3878,to validate or refute a widely accepted epidemiologic phenomenon known as the weber effect by replicating weber s original observation by using drugs that were marketed in the united states and using reports from a u s database
3879,retrospective analysis of adverse event databases
3880,university research center
3881,the original nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs studied by weber that were approved by the u s food and drug administration fda and marketed in the united states diclofenac sodium diclofenac potassium diflunisal sulindac flurbiprofen and piroxicam
3882,reports of adverse events submitted to the fdas spontaneous reporting system and the adverse event reporting system from january december for these drugs were analyzed according to the number of adverse events reported for each drug per year from the time the drug was approved until december
3883,reporting patterns were considered to demonstrate the weber effect if the highest peak in reports during the first years after product approval occurred during year all five drugs analyzed in this study demonstrated the weber effect
3884,the weber effect was replicable by using drugs marketed in the united states and using reports that were submitted to a u s database
3885,various other factors affected spontaneous reporting of adverse events as peaks in the number of reports were seen numerous times for each drug after the initial year marketing period
3886,a year old woman with advanced rheumatoid arthritis ra suffered two episodes of hyperkalemic hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis hcma
3887,plasma renin activity pra and plasma aldosterone concentration pac were markedly suppressed in the first episode occurring in paralell with the administration of metoprolol during piroxicam and lobenzarit cca therapy
3888,rechallenge with diclofenac sodium and cca lead to the second hyperkalemia but no significant suppression of the renin aldosterone axis was seen at that time
3889,this suggests that the different mechanisms contribute to the development of these episodes including the tubulo interstitial injury which is not uncommon in ra
3890,the combined use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and beta adrenergic blockers may increase the risk of life threatening hyperkalemia through their suppressive effect on the renin aldosterone system whereas the concomitant administration of cca with nsaids through the impairment in the renal tubular function
3891,these drugs should be most carefully given to patients with a latent defect in renal potassium excretion
3892,infection may lead to inflammation atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular events
3893,the atherosclerotic effect of hypercholesterolaemia on the vascular system is well known
3894,however limited studies were done on the therapeutic and preventative agents
3895,the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of infection and cholesterol rich diet combined with an antibiotic anti inflammatory agent and red wine on the pulmonary vascular system
3896,fifty nine rats were evaluated
3897,six groups were created control group i n infection group ii n infection cholesterol rich diet group iii n infection cholesterol rich diet cefepime group iv n ii infection cholesterol rich diet diclofenac potassium group v n infection cholesterol rich diet and red wine group vi n
3898,blood samples of rats were collected for cholesterol analysis every month
3899,sections of central pulmonary arteries were examined for thickness of the intima and medial wall by computerised image analysis
3900,there was a statistically significant difference in serum cholesterol levels and in thickness of the intima between the groups p
3901,the rest of the groups had more intimal thickening than group i p
3902,group iii had thicker intima than groups iv and v p p respectively
3903,there was no significant difference between the groups in thickness of media p
3904,infection and cholesterol rich diet have a synergistic effect on atherosclerosis in pulmonary arteries
3905,however antibiotics and anti inflammatory agents could be useful in prevention
3906,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide
3907,diclofenac sodium ds one of these nsaids has a high specificity for arachidonic acid degrading cyclooxygenase cox enzymes
3908,this drug can be used to relieve neuropathic pain
3909,in this review we examine the relevant researches including in vivo animal and clinical human studies with the aim of understanding the effect of ds on the peripheral nerves
3910,in injured nerves cox is potently upregulated around the injury site
3911,when a nerve is damaged both cox and cox expression is increased in macrophages and schwann cells
3912,in addition cox inhibitors can promote axonal outgrowth in cultured neurons
3913,neuropathic pain occurs after injury and leads to dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system
3914,nsaids can modulate the nociceptive and inflammatory pain pathways and control neuropathic pain
3915,ds may accelerate nerve regeneration and its effects on healing as well as causing deleterious effects in the developing nerves
3916,ds teratogenicity disrupts myelin sheath thickness and axon structure
3917,understanding the possible benefits and limitations of ds and specific conditions such as prenatal use will be of benefit in clinical practice
3918,newer drug delivery systems such as transdermal patches using pain relieving or modifying agents emerged as a mainstream treatment protocol for management of pain on the outpatient basis
3919,the administration of diclofenac mg in the transdermal patch in the patients having dental pain due to periapical periodontal infections was evaluated
3920,ninety patients of either gender between and years were divided into groups group a oral medication group b transdermal patch group c intramuscular group
3921,patients at the dental department with pain from periapical periodontal pathologies were explained about the procedure of analgesia
3922,with written consent mg diclofenac sodium transdermal patches were prescribed to patients who opted their use in pain control for consecutive days
3923,a visual analog scale was provided for all patients assessing the pain intensity during the study
3924,significant difference in the mean percentage reduction in visual analog scale vas score among the three groups at day and
3925,diclofenac administered through oral and im routes showed significant improvement in pain relief when compared to the transdermal route
3926,however diclofenac transdermal patches have shown significant improvement in vas score between the baseline and consecutive days and can be used in mild pain with lower adverse events
3927,osteoarthritis oa is one of the most common causes of joint pain in the united states and non steroidal anti inflammatories nsaids such as diclofenac sodium which is currently available in two main routes of administration oral and topical distribution have been established as one of the standard treatments for oa
3928,generally oral nsaids are well tolerated however our narrative review suggests that the topical solution had a better tolerability property than oral diclofenac sodium especially due to side effects of gastrointestinal bleeding with the utilization of the oral format
3929,in addition the topical route may be considered a reasonable selection by clinicians for management of musculoskeletal pain in those patients with a history of potential risk and adverse side effects
3930,most studies reviewed comparing oral versus topical solution of diclofenac sodium revealed comparable efficacy with minimal side effects utilizing the topical route
3931,the key point of this narrative review is to help clinicians that currently must decide between very inexpensive diclofenac oral presentations and expensive topical presentations especially in the elderly population and the pros and cons of such decision making process
3932,to assess the influence of diclofenac sodium dic treatment on tilmicosin til prompted cardiotoxicity forty albino rats were randomly divided into four equal groups control til group single subcutaneous injection of mg kg bw tilmicosin phosphate til dic group single subcutaneous injection of tilmicosin phosphate and then injection intramuscularly of mg kg bw day for days diclofenac sodium and dic group intramuscular injection of mg kg bw day diclofenac sodium for days
3933,creatine kinase mb lactate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase urea and creatinine significantly elevated in all treated groups but markedly in til dic group serum
3934,lipid peroxidation significantly increased and reduced glutathione significantly decreased in tissues of all groups
3935,several histopathological alterations were noticed in heart liver kidneys and lungs of all treated groups particularly til dic group
3936,ultrastructurally myocardium of til and til dic groups showed characteristic changes for myocardial apoptosis and degeneration
3937,significant differences were detected in area percentage of caspase protein expression and bcl immunoreactivity in cardiomyocytes particularly in til dic group
3938,this study is the first to indicate that one of the possible mechanisms of til cardiotoxicity is myocardial apoptosis
3939,dic amplifies til induced cardiotoxicity besides its hepato nephrotoxicity
3940,halloysite was found to have interesting nanotubular geometry viable for the entrapment of various active agents
3941,in this experiment the ability of hollow halloysite cylinders to entrap the anionic model drug diclofenac sodium and to retard drug dissolution rate was investigated
3942,drugs could be incorporated into layered tubules via three different mechanisms adsorption intercalation and tubular entrapment
3943,based on the adsorption studies some diclofenac sodium was shown to be adsorbed to the polyionic mineral surface despite its permanent negative charge
3944,the x ray powder diffraction analysis xrpd results did not prove any intercalation reaction to occur
3945,the most important drug loading mechanism involved the tubular entrapment with encapsulation efficiency
3946,the drug release from halloysite was prolonged in comparison with the dissolution of pure drug
3947,halloysite itself as well as halloysite loaded with the drug proved to be appropriate material to form pellets by extrusion spheronization method
3948,halloysite diclofenac sodium drug entrapment pellets prolonged drug release
3949,despite many advances in surgery and technology colonic anastomosis remains a challenge after colonic resection
3950,the purpose of this study is to compare the safety of using diclofenac sodium and paracetamol for analgesia in colonic anastomosis on rats
3951,wistar hannover rats were randomly allocated to four groups group sham operated group group control group group diclofenac sodium group group paracetamol group
3952,after laparotomy the left colon was transected and a single layer anastomosis was made with vicryl in groups and only laparotomy was performed in group after anastomosis we administered saline to group diclofenac sodium to group and paracetamol to group for days
3953,then all animals were decapitated
3954,the anastomotic region was resected and bursting pressure was measured
3955,then the specimen was sent to the laboratory for histological examination and hydroxyproline analysis
3956,bursting pressure and hydroxyproline level were significantly higher in the paracetamol group p
3957,when we looked at the fibrosis levels of these groups it was also higher in paracetamol group
3958,bursting pressure hydroxyproline levels and fibrosis levels indicate that the perioperative use of paracetamol for analgesia when undergoing colonic anastomosis is safer than diclofenac sodium
3959,diclofenac sodium ds is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug with antipyretic and analgesic effects
3960,it is mainly found in the form of sodium salt
3961,the mechanism of action of ds operates by way of cyclooxygenase cox inhibition
3962,the physiological effect of this substance derives from a decrease in prostaglandin production
3963,ds is a benzeneacetic acid derivative with anti inflammatory properties
3964,as a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid ds binds to both forms of cox cox and cox and inhibits the conversion of arachidonic acid into pro inflammatory prostaglandins by means of chelation
3965,at the same time this agent is also able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in which cox is involved
3966,ds is effective in overcoming pain and inflammation when it inhibits cox but gastrointestinal side effects appear when it inhibits cox
3967,in this review we have focused on chemical structure and pharmacokinetic properties and renal effects of ds in light of current knowledge
3968,additionally use of diclofenac nanoparticles were also discussed
3969,topical formulations of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are generally considered to be safer alternatives to oral nsaids due to lower systemic absorption
3970,we conducted randomized crossover studies that compared the pharmacokinetics pk bioequivalence and safety of topical diclofenac sodium twice daily bid diclofenac sodium four times daily qid and oral diclofenac sodium in healthy subjects
3971,the results of three bioequivalence studies are reviewed
3972,healthy adult subjects n applied topical diclofenac sodium solution mg ml bid or solution mg drops qid to each knee for consecutive days separated by a washout period
3973,subjects n in one study also received oral diclofenac sodium mg bid for days
3974,plasma diclofenac concentrations were determined from serial blood samples collected on days and steady state and diclofenac pk parameters were estimated by noncompartmental methods
3975,the studies demonstrated comparable bioequivalence between the and topical solutions as well as lower systemic exposure compared to oral dosing approximately less
3976,daily systemic exposure was comparable between the two formulations with only a difference in the aucss p
3977,furthermore both topical solutions demonstrated delayed elimination with a t of to fold longer as compared to oral diclofenac
3978,the solution provided more consistent dosing relative to the solution when comparing aucss and cmaxss across studies
3979,mild application site reactions were the most common treatment emergent adverse event reported with topical diclofenac
3980,the steady state pk profile of topical diclofenac solution administered bid is similar to that of the solution administered qid
3981,systemic exposure to diclofenac is substantially lower after topical application as compared to oral administration
3982,study was registered with clinicaltrials gov nct https clinicaltrials gov ct results term search search
3983,the objective of present study was to develop and evaluate polyethylene glycol peg based diclofenac sodium suppositories
3984,this study used water soluble peg bases and in different combinations to formulate suppositories which were further subjected for their physicochemical properties evaluation such as weight variation average melting point content uniformity and disintegration
3985,dissolution test was used to perform the in vitro release rate studies of the suppositories
3986,the suppository p containing peg and peg exhibited rapid in vitro release rate of diclofenac sodium
3987,moreover homogeneous distribution of diclofenac sodium is found in all six formulations
3988,the in vitro release patterns of diclofenac sodium from the marketed voltral suppository mg and formulated suppositories were also compared and found in standard limits
3989,recent experiments showed a potential cardiotoxic effect of the macrolide antibiotic tulathromycin
3990,this study was performed to investigate whether diclofenac sodium dfs potentiates the cardiotoxicity of tulathromycin and increases the cardioprotective effects of lycopene against dfs and tulathromycin
3991,seven groups eight per group of adult swiss albino mice received saline control tulathromycin a single subcutaneous dose of mg kg bw on day dfs a single oral dose of mg kg bw on day tulathromycin plus dfs or lycopene oral mg kg bw daily for d combined with tulathromycin dfs or both
3992,compared to the control group the administration of tulathromycin or dfs individually or in combination caused significantly elevated
3993,the interactions of sodium diclofenac drug s dcf with different graphene species were investigated using both first principles calculations based on density functional theory dft and adsorption experiments
3994,through batch adsorption experiments it was found that rgo was a good adsorbent for removing the s dcf drug from aqueous solutions
3995,the general order kinetic model shows the best fit to the experimental data compared with pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic adsorption models
3996,the equilibrium data at c were fitted to the liu isotherm model
3997,the maximum sorption capacity for adsorption of the s dcf drug was mg g for rgo
3998,the s dcf adsorption onto pristine graphene graphene with a vacancy reduced oxide graphene rgo and functionalized graphene nanoribbons were simulated providing a good understanding of the adsorption process of this molecule on graphene family surfaces
3999,the results predict a physisorption regime in all cases
4000,based on these results the ab initio calculations and the adsorption experiments point out that the graphene family are promising materials for extracting s dcf from wastewater effluents
4001,skin pretreatment with a microneedle roller microporation mp appears a simple and inexpensive technique to increase transdermal delivery of topically applied drug products
4002,this study investigates the effect of mp on the passive and iontophoretic delivery of diclofenac dcf by quantifying dermis and plasma levels of dcf in a rabbit model
4003,new zealand albino female rabbits received either i a topical application of g of voltaren gel with or without pretreatment with a microroller mm needle length density microneedles per cm area or ii a dcf solution mg ml via iontophoresis iomed transq e medium size patch with or without microroller pretreatment
4004,a a cm cathodic current was applied for min for a total of ma
4005,dcf concentrations were monitored in dermis with microdialysis sampling every min for h plasma samples were collected over the same period
4006,in the passive delivery studies microroller pretreatment increased cmax by and fold in skin and plasma respectively and auc by and fold in skin and plasma respectively
4007,in the iontophoresis delivery studies microporation increased cmax by fold both in skin and in plasma and auc by and fold in skin and plasma respectively
4008,in conclusion microneedle pretreatment increased significantly the systemic exposure of dcf from either passive or iontophoretic delivery whereas the effect in skin was less pronounced
4009,exposure to drugs often results in toxicity in the kidney which represents the major control system maintaining homeostasis of the body and thus is especially susceptible to xenobiotics
4010,nephrotoxicity is a life threatening side effect of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
4011,diclofenac is one of the most frequently prescribed nsaids and have been reported to cause multiple organs damage
4012,curcumin cur exhibits nephroprotective properties
4013,therefore rats were divided into four groups rats of groups and received diclofenac mg kg i m
4014,whereas rats of groups and received cur mg kg p o
4016,diclofenac revealed a significant increase in urea and creatinine levels and malondialdehyde concentration and marked reduction in catalase activity and reduced glutathione concentration
4017,histopathologically diclofenac produced fatty changes and eosinophilic casts were detected in the renal tubules those were attenuated by administration of cur prior diclofenac
4018,to reinforce the hydroxyethyl cellulose for using it in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications as a drug delivery systems the grafting of acrylamide onto hydroxyethyl cellulose aam g hec was achieved by ce iv induced free radical polymerization
4019,the aam g hec was then blended with sodium alginate naalg to prepare ph sensitive interpenetrating network ipn microspheres mps by emulsion crosslinking method using glutaraldehyde ga as a crosslinking agent
4020,the produced mps are almost spherical in nature with smooth surfaces
4021,diclofenac sodium ds an anti inflammatory drug was successfully encapsulated into the mps
4022,the encapsulation efficiency was found to vary between and the mps were characterized by dsc sem and ftir spectroscopy
4023,in vitro release studies were carried out in simulated gastric fluid of ph for h followed by simulated intestinal fluid of ph at c
4024,the release data have been fitted to an empirical equation to investigate the diffusional exponent n which indicated that the release mechanism shifted from anomalous to the super case ii transport
4025,to evaluate corneal sensitivity by using the cochet bonnet esthesiometer in normal canine eyes at different time points following instillation of three different topical non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs flurbiprofen sodium diclofenac sodium and ketorolac tromethamine and benzalkonium chloride
4026,six healthy mixed breed dogs from the same litter were used in two different stages
4027,first one drop of flurbiprofen sodium and diclofenac sodium in each eye second one drop of ketorolac tromethamine and benzalkonium chloride in each eye
4028,baseline esthesiometry was obtained before eye drop application and every minutes thereafter until a total of minutes of evaluation time
4029,a one week interval was allowed between the two treatment phases
4030,statistical analysis was used to compare means according to time of evaluation and drug used
4031,diclofenac sodium decreased corneal sensitivity at and minutes p with possible interference on neuronal nociceptive activity and analgesic effect while ketorolac tromethamine did not show any variation for esthesiometry means along the evaluation
4032,flurbiprofen sodium resulted in increased esthesiometry values minutes after instillation p increasing corneal sensitivity and possibly producing a greater irritant corneal effect over its analgesic properties
4033,benzalkonium chloride significantly increased corneal sensitivity at minutes of evaluation p most likely resulting from its irritating effect
4034,esthesiometry did not allow a definite conclusion over the analgesic effect of the nsaids tested however it was effective in detecting fluctuations in corneal sensitivity
4035,the aim of the present study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous injection i v
4036,and oral administration p o
4037,of diclofenac sodium dic in sprague dawley sd rats
4038,twelve male sd rats were divided into groups n per group one group was injected intravenously with mg kg dic whereas the other group was lavaged with mg kg dic
4039,blood samples were collected prior to dic delivery h and and h post administration

4041,pharmacokinetics software was applied to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters using a non compartmental model
4043,administration of dic the terminal elimination rate constant
4044,the objective of our study was to develop controlled drug delivery system based on erythrocyte ghosts for amphiphilic compound sodium diclofenac considering the differences between erythrocytes derived from two readily available materials porcine slaughterhouse and outdated transfusion human blood
4045,starting erythrocytes empty erythrocyte ghosts and diclofenac loaded ghosts were compared in terms of the encapsulation efficiency drug releasing profiles size distribution surface charge conductivity surface roughness and morphology
4046,the encapsulation of sodium diclofenac was performed by an osmosis based process gradual hemolysis
4047,during this process sodium diclofenac exerted mild and delayed antihemolytic effect and increased potassium efflux in porcine but not in outdated human erythrocytes
4048,ftir spectra revealed lack of any membrane lipid disorder and chemical reaction with sodium diclofenac in encapsulated ghosts
4049,outdated human erythrocyte ghosts with detected nanoscale damages and reduced ability to shrink had encapsulation efficiency of only
4050,on the other hand porcine erythrocyte ghosts had encapsulation efficiency of and relatively slow drug release rate
4051,more preserved structure and functional properties of porcine erythrocytes related to their superior encapsulation and release performances define them as more appropriate for the usage in sodium diclofenac encapsulation process
4052,epilepsy is a disorder that affects of the population and a significant percentage of these patients do not respond to anticonvulsant drugs available in the market suggesting the need to investigate new pharmacological treatments
4053,several studies have shown that inflammation occurs during epileptogenesis and may contribute to the development and progression of epilepsy demonstrating increased levels of pro inflammatory interleukins in animal models and human patients
4054,the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory diclofenac sodium on the severity of seizures and levels of pro inflammatory interleukins in animals with kindling model induced by ptz
4055,the kindling model was induced by injections of subconvulsant doses of ptz mg kg in alternated days for days of treatment
4056,the animals were divided into four groups control group given saline group treated with diazepam mg kg and groups treated with diclofenac sodium and mg kg
4057,after treatment the open field tests was conducted
4058,the severity of seizures was evaluated by the racine scale
4059,we evaluated the levels of il il and tnf in the blood hippocampus and cortex of animals
4060,the treatment with diclofenac sodium in the ptz induced kindling model decreased severity of seizures and interleukin and tnf levels in the hippocampus of animals treated with doses of and mg kg
4061,new studies are needed to investigate a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of epilepsy with this anti inflammatory non steroidal drug
4062,diclofenac sodium a widely detected pharmaceutical drug in wastewater samples has been selected as a model pollutant for degradation using novel combined approach of hydrodynamic cavitation and heterogeneous photocatalysis
4063,a slit venturi has been used as cavitating device in the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor
4064,the effect of various operating parameters such as inlet fluid pressure bar and initial ph of the solution on the extent of degradation have been studied
4065,the maximum extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium was obtained at inlet fluid pressure of bar and initial ph as using hydrodynamic cavitation alone
4066,the loadings of tio and ho have been optimised to maximise the extent of degradation of diclofenac sodium
4067,kinetic study revealed that the degradation of diclofenac sodium fitted first order kinetics over the selected range of operating protocols
4068,it has been observed that combination of hydrodynamic cavitation with uv uv tio and uv tio ho results in enhanced extents of degradation as compared to the individual schemes
4069,the maximum extent of degradation as with reduction in toc has been observed using hydrodynamic cavitation in conjunction with uv tio ho under the optimised operating conditions
4070,the diclofenac sodium degradation byproducts have been identified using lc ms analysis
4071,the penetration enhancement of sodium diclofenac and diclofenac by alcohols with various alkyl chains c to c was evaluated by the steady state flux of diclofenac through rat abdominal skin
4072,decanol showed the greatest effect in this series
4073,a more remarkable enhancing effect of the alcohols was observed in sodium diclofenac than in diclofenac
4074,diclofenac can penetrate through the ethylene vinyl acetate membrane as a lipoid model membrane but sodium diclofenac can not
4075,decanol enhanced the penetration of phenol red being dependent on its concentration in the vehicle
4076,therefore decanol may interact with lipoid components of the skin and increase the aqueous pathway in the skin
4077,these results indicate that sodium diclofenac and diclofenac may be penetrated through partially different pathways
4078,the aim of the study is to evaluate the ototoxicity of topical diclofenac sodium in comparison to positive and negative controls prior to the investigation of analgesic and anti inflammatory efficacy of the agent in otic administration
4079,twenty four ears of guinea pigs were included in the study
4080,wide myringotomy was performed on all tympanic membranes under general anesthesia and auditory brainstem responses abr were evaluated
4081,the subjects were separated into four groups two groups received diclofenac sodium at low and high doses positive controls received gentamicin and negative controls received isotonic sodium chloride topically for days and abrs were reevaluated
4082,no significant difference were observed between the pre and post treatment click response khz and khz response threshold levels after isotonic sodium chloride administration
4083,all threshold levels were elevated in the positive control group
4084,in the low and high dose diclofenac sodium groups click response khz and khz response threshold levels were significantly higher compared to the baseline values
4085,pre and post treatment mean threshold level changes were not significantly different between the low and high dose diclofenac sodium groups
4086,pre and post treatment mean threshold level changes in the gentamicin group were not significantly different from low or high dose diclofenac sodium groups
4087,diclofenac sodium considered as an analgesic and anti inflammatory otic preparation is shown to be as ototoxic as gentamicin in chronic use which may lead to loss of hearing especially when used topically in chronic otitis cases with tympanic membrane damage
4088,diclofenac sodium as ophthalmic dosage form is used for the treatment of the pain swelling and redness of patients eyes recovering from cataract surgery however it faces the bioavailability limitation of eye drops due to effective protective mechanisms and corneal barrier functions in the eyes
4089,therefore this investigation was aimed to develop ocular film formulations to achieve controlled drug release
4090,drug films were prepared using polymers namely hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc and polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp eudragit rl po and eudragit rs po by solvent casting method considering parameters such as drug polymer ratio different polymer combinations as well as plasticizer effect
4091,ocular films were evaluated for various physicochemical parameters such as physical characters film thickness uniformity of weight drug content swelling index mucoadhesion time and in vitro release study
4092,ocular films complied with all physicochemical parameters underwent in vitro release study
4093,finally the film formulation with hpmc eudragit rs po ratio drug polymer ratio and glycerin as plasticizer showed controlled and prolonged release following the zero order and non fickian transport
4094,in this study a granulate for the oral controlled delivery of diclofenac sodium ds an anionic sparingly soluble nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug has been realized by wet granulation using a surface modified natural zeolite smnz as an excipient
4095,the surface modification of the zeolite has been achieved by means of a cationic surfactant so as to allow the loading of ds through ionic interaction and bestow a control over the drug release mechanism
4096,the granules possessed a satisfactory dosage uniformity a flowability suitable for an oral dosage form manufacturing along with a sustained drug release up to h driven by both ion exchange and transport kinetics
4097,furthermore the obtained granulate did not elicit a significant cytotoxicity and could also induce a prolonged anti inflammatory effect on raw cells
4098,taking also into account that natural zeolites are generally abundant and economic smnz can be considered as an attracting alternative excipient for the production of granules with sustained release features
4099,the present research deals with the usefulness of isolated linseed polysaccharide lp as polymeric blends with an anionic polymer sodium alginate to prepare ionotropically cross linking gelled mucoadhesive beads for controlled drug release
4100,from the mature and ripe linseeds linum usitatisimum family linaceae lp was isolated and its colour odour taste solubility in water ph and viscosity were studied
4101,isolated lp was also characterized by ftir spectroscopy and
4102,this study evaluated diclofenac concentrations in plasma selected hind limb tissues and synovial fluid after repeated topical applications of two diclofenac formulations
4103,group gottingen minipigs n were administered diclofenac sodium topical solution twice daily on days and once on day group minipigs n were administered diclofenac sodium topical solution four times daily on days and twice on day approximately mg of diclofenac was applied daily to a cm dosing site centered over the patella of the right knee
4104,plasma and tissue samples were collected throughout and analysed for diclofenac concentrations using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry
4105,on day diclofenac sodium topical solution produced higher plasma concentrations compared with the formulation however after h and throughout the remainder of the dosing period plasma concentrations appeared similar except at the h time point
4106,twenty four hours after the final application skin treated with diclofenac sodium topical solution retained a significantly p greater amount of diclofenac than the formulation
4107,generally both formulations produced similar diclofenac concentrations in synovial fluid underlying muscle tendon and bone h after the last application
4108,the diclofenac formulation applied twice daily delivered similar amounts of diclofenac as the formulation administered four times daily
4109,the skin retained a significant portion of the applied dose to serve as a depot for continuous diffusion of diclofenac into underlying tissues and systemic circulation
4110,in this study we aimed to investigate the effect of diclofenac sodium ds and melatonin mel on kidney of the prenatally administered rats
4111,pregnant rats were divided into the control physiological saline ds and ds mel groups
4112,all injections were given beginning from the th day after mating to the th day of the pregnancy
4113,physical dissector and cavalieri principle were used to estimate the numerical density and total number of glomeruli and the volumetric parameters of kidney respectively
4114,our stereological results indicated that ds application during the pregnancy lead to decrease in the mean volume numerical density and total number of the glomeruli p
4115,in addition we determined that usage of the mel with the ds caused increases in the mean volume numerical density and total number of the glomeruli p
4116,so there was no significant difference in terms of the any parameter between the cont and ds mel groups p
4117,light microscopic investigation showed congestion in blood vessels and shrinkage of the bowman s space in the ds group
4118,moreover there was degeneration in nephrons including glomerulosclerosis and tubular defects and an increase in the connective tissue in the kidneys of the ds treated group
4119,however usage of the mel with the ds caused preventing of these pathological alterations in the kidney
4120,we suggested that ds might lead to adverse effects in the kidneys of the rats that are prenatally subjected to this drug
4121,fortunately these adverse effects can be prevented by the melatonin supplementation
4122,two different salts of diclofenac diclofenac sodium and diclofenac potassium in tablet dosage form were tested for their bioavailability and disposition kinetics in a group of eighteen rabbits in normal and experimentally induced dehydrated conditions with a wash out period of days between both stages of study
4123,biochemical and physiological parameters were also measured in both normal and dehydrated states

4131,poloxamer solutions prepared with poloxamers and sodium chloride were previously reported to undergo a phase transition to bioadhesive gels at body temperature
4132,for the development of a thermosensitive diclofenac sodium loaded poloxamer gel here we investigated the effect of sodium chloride on the release safety and rectal absorption in rats of diclofenac sodium delivered by the poloxamer gels
4133,p delayed the release rates of diclofenac sodium from poloxamer gels
4134,however sodium chloride showed no significant effect on the release rates of diclofenac sodium from poloxamer gels
4135,release mechanism analysis showed the release of diclofenac sodium was proportional to the time
4136,the initial plasma concentrations of diclofenac sodium in the rectal formulation diclofenac sodium poloxamer p poloxamer p sodium chloride were significantly higher compared with those in semi solid suppository
4137,furthermore it gave significantly faster tmax of diclofenac sodium than did semi solid suppository indicating that the diclofenac sodium from poloxamer gel could be absorbed faster than that from semi solid one in rats
4138,it did not cause any morphological damage to the rectal tissues
4139,these results suggested that poloxamer gel with sodium chloride could be a more effective and safe rectal delivery system of diclofenac sodium
4140,non compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of diclofenac sodium dic and papaverine hydrochloride pap after oral administration of composed tablets to rabbits was developed
4141,hplc method for determination of dic and pap in rabbit plasma was developed and validated

4143,pharmacokinetic analysis showed that oral administration of a tablet composed of dic and pap do not change the pharmacokinetic parameters such as mrt mat cl and bioavailability of the active substances compared with single administration of dic and pap after single dose
4144,nigella sativa or kalonji is a naturally occurring plant in pakistan and other countries which possesses a wide range of medicinal properties the anti inflammatory property being one of these
4145,diclofenac sodium is a commonly used anti inflammatory drug
4146,the purpose of this study was to compare the anti inflammatory effect of ethanolic extract of nigella sativa seeds with that of diclofenac sodium in albino rats
4147,this laboratory randomized controlled trial rct was conducted in the physiology department services institute of medical sciences sims lahore
4148,the study was carried out on male albino rats
4149,five percent formalin in a dose of l was injected into sub plantar surface of right hind paw of each rat to produce inflammation
4150,the rats were randomly divided into three groups of thirty each
4151,group a was given normal saline control group b was given nigella sativa seed extract and group c received diclofenac sodium as a reference drug
4152,increase in paw diameter and total and differential leukocyte counts were measured as markers of inflammation
4153,nigella sativa seeds extract caused significant p reduction in the paw inflammatory response in albino rats
4154,the effect was longer in duration than the effect caused by diclofenac sodium however the extract was comparatively less potent than diclofenac sodium
4155,the extract had no significant effect p on the total or differential leukocyte counts
4156,our results suggest that ethanolic extract of nigella sativa seeds possesses potent anti inflammatory effect in albino rats however this effect is comparatively less but prolonged than that produced by diclofenac sodium
4157,to investigate the effectiveness of sodium diclofenac and sodium salicylate applied by topical iontophoresis and to compare them in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis
4158,forty patients with lateral epicondylitis were randomized into two groups of patients who were matched for age and sex
4159,the patients in one group were treated by iontophoresis of sodium diclofenac and the other group were treated by iontophoresis of sodium salicylate
4160,then infrared treatment was applied to patients in both groups
4161,pain scores obtained before and after treatment were compared
4162,pain produced by pressure on the lateral epicondyle on resisting wrist extension during function and spontaneous pain at rest significantly decreased in both groups after treatment p
4163,when pain scores obtained after treatment were compared greater decrease was observed in the pain produced on resisting wrist extension p and by pressure on the lateral epicondyle p in the group treated with sodium diclofenac than in the group treated with sodium salicylate
4164,the results suggest some benefits from the process of iontophoresis and the use of infrared in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis and indicate that iontophoresis of sodium diclofenac is more effective than that of sodium salicylate
4165,an intravenous bolus formulation of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium has been developed using hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd as a solubility enhancer
4166,hp cd diclofenac dyloject tm is available for use in adults in the usa for the management of mild to moderate pain and as monotherapy or in combination with opioid analgesics for the management of moderate to severe pain
4167,in two multicentre phase iii studies in adults with acute moderate to severe postoperative pain hp cd diclofenac significantly reduced pain intensity and the need for rescue medication compared with placebo
4168,in these studies the tolerability profile of hp cd diclofenac was generally similar to that of placebo and adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in severity
4169,constipation infusion site pain and dizziness were the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring numerically more frequently with hp cd diclofenac than placebo
4170,therapy with hp cd diclofenac does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular renal or bleeding related adverse events versus placebo
4171,thus hp cd diclofenac extends the treatment options currently available for the management of moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults
4172,the aim of this study was to prepare diclofenac hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc and diclofenac loaded nanoparticles hpmc films as potential systems for ocular delivery

4174,chitosan hyaluronic acid nanoparticles were prepared by the ionotropic gelation technique
4175,nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy dynamic light scattering drug encapsulation efficiency and rheological studies
4176,in vitro drug studies and corneal penetration release studies were carried out
4177,drug release mechanism was finally evaluated by fitting the ritger and peppas equation to data
4178,in addition corneal hydration level was calculated to determine whether films could damage the corneas
4179,diclofenac hpmc films presented a faster drug release and a higher drug penetration than nanoparticles on the contrary nanoparticles containing films were able to give a more sustained release of the drug and thus a slower diclofenac permeation through the cornea than hpmc films
4180,nanoparticles loaded with diclofenac sodium in hpmc films may be a valuable alternative for the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases since these formulations offer the benefit of sustained releasing directly to the site of action

4198,three sensitive selective and precise spectrophotometric methods based on manipulation of ratio spectra have been developed and validated for the determination of diclofenac sodium and pantoprazole sodium
4199,the first method is based on ratio spectra peak to peak measurement using the amplitudes at and nm the second method involves the first derivative of the ratio spectra nm using the peak amplitudes at nm for diclofenac sodium and nm for pantoprazole sodium
4200,the third is the method of mean centering of ratio spectra using the values at nm for both the analytes
4201,all the three methods were linear over the concentration range of g ml for diclofenac sodium and g ml for pantoprazole sodium
4202,the methods were validated according to the ich guidelines and accuracy precision repeatability and robustness are found to be within the acceptable limit
4203,the results of single factor anova analysis indicated that there is no significant difference among the developed methods

4212,ten participants showed total remission of all clinical features of the lesion and three had partial improvement of the characteristics
4213,one participant presented worsening of clinical condition and in five cases treatment was discontinued due to development of mild adverse effects at the site of gel application
4214,regarding satisfaction analyses and tolerability to the drug from patients who completed treatment without adverse effects or complications most agreed fully that they were satisfied with the therapy n and that the drug was not irritating to the mouth n
4215,patients are being monitored without clinical signs of recurrence and or progression of the lesions
4216,topical application of the drug has provided a convenient and well tolerated in most cases
4217,diclofenac sodium gel may be a promising alternative for treatment of actinic cheilitis
4218,effects of frequently used anti inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and diclofenac was studied on experimental wound healing in rats
4219,these drugs impede tissue repair by virtue of retarding inflammation
4220,there was reduction in wound strength measured in terms of tensile strength in experimental rats

4226,plasma concentration of diclofenac sodium and diclofenac potassium decreased in diabetic condition
4227,significantly high concentration of diclofenac potassium was observed in normal and diabetic conditions as compared to diclofenac sodium
4228,the variation in bioavailability and disposition of diclofenac sodium and diclofenac potassium in diabetic state will require adjustment of the dosage regimen prescribed for diabetics in clinical setting
4229,halloysite aluminosilicate clay with the particle shape of multilayered hollow nanotubes used in various non medical applications e g
4230,in ceramic industry was discovered for pharmaceutical purposes in recent years
4231,several drugs of hydrophilic and lipophilic nature have been successfully encapsulated into halloysite tubules in order to modify their dissolution profile
4232,the main goal of this experiment was to optimize the dissolution profile of diclofenac sodium a drug with problematic solubility from halloysite tubules using various polymers
4233,loading of the drug together with povidone or eudragit rs did not lead to drug burst effect reduction and its slower dissolution
4234,in the case of povidone drug improved wettability and solubilization rather than viscosity increasing expectations were observed
4235,eudragit rs formed a solid dispersion with diclofenac sodium and thus the solvent drug solution penetration through the polymer and not the drug solubility was the dissolution rate limiting factor
4236,reduction of the burst effect and further prolongation of drug release was achieved by coating the drug loaded halloysite with chitosan
4237,this formulation exhibited a diffusion controlled prolonged release following higuchi kinetic model
4238,the pharmacology pharmacokinetics clinical efficacy adverse effects and dosage of diclofenac sodium are reviewed
4239,diclofenac the first nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agent nsaid to be approved that is a phenylacetic acid derivative competes with arachidonic acid for binding to cyclo oxygenase resulting in decreased formation of prostaglandins
4240,the drug has both analgesic and antipyretic activities
4241,diclofenac is efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract peak plasma concentrations occur to hours after ingestion in fasting subjects
4242,even though diclofenac has a relatively short elimination half life in plasma hours it persists in synovial fluid
4243,the drug is metabolized in the liver and is eliminated by urinary and biliary excretion
4244,in clinical trials diclofenac was as effective as aspirin diflunisal indomethacin sulindac ibuprofen ketoprofen and naproxen in improving function and reducing pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
4245,for treatment of osteoarthritis diclofenac was equivalent in efficacy to aspirin diflunisal indomethacin sulindac ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen flurbiprofen mefenamic acid and piroxicam
4246,diclofenac was as effective as indomethacin or sulindac in treating ankylosing spondylitis
4247,the most frequent adverse effects reported for diclofenac were gastrointestinal but these effects were fewer and less serious than occurred with aspirin or indomethacin in addition diclofenac caused fewer central nervous system reactions than indomethacin
4248,diclofenac is administered in divided doses with meals
4249,the recommended total daily dosage is to mg osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis or to mg rheumatoid arthritis
4250,diclofenac is effective but no more so than other nsaids
4251,it is structurally distinct and offers another choice in the treatment of rheumatological conditions

4255,subjects included pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department with a temperature of c or higher
4256,infants under months of age were excluded
4257,patients were excluded if they received antipyretics within h prior to presenting to the emergency department
4258,body temperature was measured at min intervals following diclofenac sodium injections
4259,fever alleviation was defined as the temperature decline to c below the temperature at presentation
4260,patients who received diclofenac sodium twice or more on different days were observed for side effects such as allergic reaction
4261,records from the emergency department and outpatient clinics were analyzed
4262,the dose of diclofenac sodium injected was approximately mg kg
4263,the average time elapsed until antipyresis was min
4264,the average temperature reduction after h was c
4265,the average proportion of temperature change after h was
4266,during the period at the emergency department there were no reported serious side effects
4267,a single dose of diclofenac sodium provided effective antipyresis in pediatric patients
4268,serious side effects were not observed
4269,the effect of the glycolipid hexadecyl d glucopyranoside incorporated in microemulsions me towards the enhancement of skin absorption and skin permeation of diclofenac sodium ds was evaluated
4270,a franz diffusion cell with a piece of pig s ear epidermis indicated that the optimized me formulation with glycolipid wt exhibited significantly higher permeability than the conventional formulations
4271,the releasing profiles of ds from me formulations exhibited first order release kinetics resembling a diffusion controlled release model for the first h

4275,clinical trials have demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac hp cd in terms of relieving moderate to severe postoperative pain in patients undergoing dental surgery or minor orthopaedic surgery
4276,subcutaneous diclofenac hp cd also effectively relieved moderate to severe neuropathic pain related to cancer or not
4277,diclofenac hp cd was generally well tolerated in clinical trials with injection site reactions among the most commonly reported adverse events
4278,the local tolerability of diclofenac hp cd was consistently rated as good or excellent across all studies
4279,subcutaneous administration of diclofenac is a valid alternative to intramuscular delivery with the advantages of easier administration the availability of additional body sites suitable for injection and the potential for self administration
4280,thus diclofenac hp cd or mg ml solution for subcutaneous or intramuscular injection extends the treatment options available for use in the management of pain in adults
4281,microwave induced chemical activation process was used to prepare an activated carbon from cocoa shell for efficient removal of two anti inflammatories sodium diclofenac dfc and nimesulide nm from aqueous solutions
4282,a paste was obtained from a mixture of cocoa shell and inorganic components with a ratio of inorganic organic of csc
4283,the mixture was pyrolyzed in a microwave oven in less than min
4284,the csc was acidified with a mol l hcl under reflux to produce mwcs

4291,this study was aimed at evaluating the potential effects of acute subdural hematoma asdh and diclofenac sodium ds therapy following asdh on the rat hippocampus
4292,twenty four male sprague dawley rats were used and divided into four groups
4293,ml of non heparinized autologous blood from the tail vein of the animals in the non treatment group ntg and treatment group tg was injected into the subdural space
4294,the tg received intramuscular diclofenac sodium at a mg kg dose daily from the postoperative second hour to the seventh day after the operation
4295,the control group cg and sham group sg were used for control and sham operations respectively
4296,on the postoperative eighth day all animals were sacrificed and the hippocampi of all animals were stereologically and histologically evaluated
4297,also blood samples of the animals were biochemically analyzed
4298,as a result of the study the mean number of neurons in ca ca and ca regions of the hippocampus and the total number of neurons were decreased in the hippocampus samples of the ntg and especially the tg subjects
4299,when comparing the second blood samples there was no difference between the levels of adrenaline and serotonin among the groups
4300,however after the operation noradrenalin levels in the treatment group were found to be higher than those of the sham and control groups p
4301,in the ntg and tg histopathological findings were observed such as nissl condensation as well as completely dead and indistinguishable neurons with abnormally shaped shrunken cytoplasm and nuclei
4302,also necrotic areas on the specimens of the tg were seen
4303,in immunohistochemical sections c fos positivity was decreased in the ntg and especially the tg
4304,otherwise pgc positive cells were increased in the ntg and especially the tg
4305,in this study it was shown for the first time by means of stereological techniques that using ds after asdh caused a decrease in the number of hippocampal neurons ca ca and ca regions
4306,oral thin film otf is a newly emerging drug delivery system which has many benefits for patients
4307,although there has been some formulation of otf products these have mainly been as confectionary or dental health products
4308,the most significant benefit of this dosage format will only be realised once more pharmaceutical products become available
4309,within this paper otf strips containing diclofenac sodium were prepared using the solvent casting method and then characterised to ensure the method could conform to acceptable levels of uniformity the mean sd diclofenac sodium content was mg range mg bioburden was tested against coliforms yeasts and moulds and all results were confirmed to be cfu g also similar dissolution profile when compared to a commercial product to ensure biowaiver
4310,an acceptable level of uniformity of mass was produced
4311,k f titration was employed to reduce the water content of the strips and it was found to be acceptable this represented a level of water which would not be viable for microbial growth
4312,the technique employed here in the production of otf resulted in high quality products and amenability to being up scaled
4313,furthermore the characterisation method was also sufficient to assess the quality of the products and may be used for future analysis of otf pharmaceuticals
4314,resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to antibiotics is a major problem
4315,targeting virulence factors is an alternative option to avoid the emergence of resistance to antibiotics
4316,the effect of sub inhibitory concentration of diclofenac sodium on the production of virulence factors of p aeruginosa was investigated
4317,the virulence factors included protease haemolysin pyocyanin and pyoverdin in addition to pathogenic behaviors such as swimming and twitching motilities and biofilm formation
4318,diclofenac sodium showed significant inhibition of virulence factors as compared to the control
4319,diclofenac sodium decreased twitching and swimming motilities by and respectively
4320,the percentage of inhibition of pyocyanin by diclofenac sodium was
4321,on the other hand pyoverdin was inhibited to a lesser extent
4322,diclofenac sodium reduced protease by and biofilm formation by
4323,moreover haemolytic activity in the presence of diclofenac sodium was as compared to the control haemolytic activity
4324,the inhibitory activities may be due to inhibition of quorum sensing that regulates the expression of virulence factors
4325,this study suggests the potential for the use of diclofenac sodium as an anti virulence agent in the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections
4326,the use of chemical penetration enhancers cpes is one of the most common approaches to improve the dermal and transdermal delivery of drugs
4327,however often incorporation of cpes in the formulation poses compatibility and stability challenges
4328,moreover incorporation of enhancers in the formulation leads to prolonged exposure to skin increasing the concern of causing skin reactions
4329,this study was undertaken to assess whether pretreatment with cpes is a rational approach to enhance the permeation of diclofenac sodium
4330,in vitro experiments were performed across porcine epidermis pretreated with propylene glycol or oleic acid or their combinations for and h respectively
4331,pretreatment with combination of oleic acid in propylene glycol was found to enhance the permeation of diclofenac sodium significantly only at and v v level and only when the pretreatment duration was h longer durations of pretreatment and higher concentration of oleic acid in propylene glycol did not enhance the permeation of diclofenac sodium
4332,in vivo dermatokinetic studies were carried out on sprague dawley rats
4333,a twofold increase in auc and cmax was observed in case of rats pretreated with enhancers over the group that was pretreated with buffer
4334,in conclusion this study showed that composition of the enhancers and duration of pretreatment are crucial in determining the efficacy of cpes
4335,trikatu an ayurvedic formulation comprising of a ratio of dried fruits of piper nigrum piper longum and dried rhizomes of zingiber officinale is widely used to enhance the bioavailability of drugs like vasicine indomethacin etc
4336,the enhanced biological response might lead to alteration of therapeutic regimens of commonly prescribed drugs
4337,the present work was aimed to study the effect of concomitant administration of trikatu on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diclofenac sodium a frequently prescribed non steroidal anti inflammatory drug having a poor oral bioavailability
4338,the effect of trikatu on the bioavailability profile of diclofenac sodium was studied in rabbits
4339,it was observed that trikatu significantly decreased the serum levels of diclofenac sodium
4340,the pharmacodynamic study was carried out to evaluate the effect of trikatu on the anti inflammatory activity of diclofenac sodium using carragenin induced rat paw edema model
4341,it was observed that the mean percent edema inhibition shown by the combination of trikatu and diclofenac was similar to that shown by trikatu alone but significantly less than that shown by diclofenac alone
4342,thus the experimental findings indicated that trikatu pretreatment might decrease the bioavailability of certain drugs probably through a drug herb interaction thereby adversely affecting the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs
4343,the present study involves preparation and evaluation of diclofenac buccal mucoadhesive microparticles for prolongation of buccal residence time
4344,the microparticles were prepared by modified double emulsion dehydration method o w o using sodium carboxymethylcellulose cmc na as mucoadhesive polymer

4348,f microparticles showed loading efficiency and mean particle size m
4349,the dsc showed stable character of drug in microparticles and revealed amorphous form
4350,microparticles had slower release than the commercial tablet p o o
4351,the results of mucoadhesion study showed better retention of diclofenac microparticles in mucosa min
4352,histopathological studies revealed no buccal mucosal damage
4353,it may be concluded that drug loaded buccal mucoadhesive microparticles are a suitable delivery system for ds
4354,due to the well know surfactant like properties of diclofenac sodium ds vesicular systems consisting exclusively of ds named diclosomes were designed with the aim to minimize or avoid the use of other excipients and to improve the formulation biocompatibility
4355,diclosomes were designed and characterized in terms of dimensions polydispersity index potential drug retained stability as a function of storage time and ex vivo percutaneous permeation profiles
4356,additionally diclosomes were incorporated into gel dosage forms and their performance in terms of permeation enhancement were evaluated
4357,ds was found to form nanosized vesicular systems both alone and in presence of cholesterol
4358,increasing hydrophobicity due to the presence of cholesterol resulted in smaller vesicles always spherical and homogeneous in shape
4359,permeation of ds from free solution was found to be lower respect to ones obtained for all diclosomal formulations allowing these aggregates to be considered as percutaneous permeation enhancers
4360,ds permeated from diclosomal gels was higher than that obtained with traditional niosomal gel ds plain gel and commercial specialty voltaren emulgel
4361,oral dissolvable films odfs of diclofenac sodium intended for osteoarthritis were prepared using albizia and khaya gums as hydrophilic film formers

4392,the micro chip was made of poly methyl methacrylate where a pair of micro channels and micro wells was embedded to serve as a drug diffusion barrier and a reservoir respectively
4393,for this purpose the micro channel and micro well were filled with a water soluble polymer polyethylene glycol and a fine powder of ds respectively
4394,to modulate the drug release profile we varied both the cross sectional area and length of the micro channels
4395,thus the average rate and onset time of drug release could be varied from day to day and from day to day respectively as the cross sectional area to length ratio i e a l of the micro channels increased from mm to mm
4396,to achieve both almost immediate onset and zero order release of ds we also prepared a micro chip embedded with multiple pairs of the micro wells and the micro channels of different dimensions

4426,the encapsulating species were produced through the hydrolysis and condensation of the silica precursors tetraethoxysilane or ethyltriethoxysilane introduced into the solid dispersion
4427,the transformation of precursors occurred in the vapor phase of ammonia
4428,a great advantage of the presented vapor phase method is preventing the desorption of the highly soluble drug during gelation of silica precursors which stands in contrast to the conventional sol gel processes occurring in the solution
4429,the conducted studies involving the low temperature n sorption together with spectroscopic techniques provide insight into the structural differences of drug loaded particles
4430,they reveal that the formation of silica gel accompanies the conversion of the drug into its amorphous form
4431,finally the desorption profiles of diclofenac sodium demonstrate that the deposition of silica gel successfully diminishes the degree of the initial drug desorption while significantly modifying its release rate

4495,the potential of clinical drug diclofenac sodium which is routinely used in clinics as non steroid anti inflammatory drugs opens a new insight in development of radioprotector
4496,the drug has shown its potential radioprotective efficacy in clonogenic cell survival in chinese hamster v cells with a dmf of the pbr plasmid dna gets damaged by radiation in which the supercoiled form gradually disappears with increasing radiation dose
4497,diclofenac sodium has shown its radioprotective potential by scavenging radiation induced free radicals which are depicted by its ability in restoring the fraction of supercoiled form of plasmid dna back to normal
4498,m concentration of the drug provides gssb yield of da gy
4499,this drug has shown to have a free radical scavenging activity because the radical cation with blue color is converted to the colorless neutral form by addition of diclofenac sodium in abts assay
4500,whole body survival study has shown it to protect of cbl mice at a lethal irradiation dose of gy
4501,therefore this molecule offers a potential radioprotective ability besides being used routinely as analgesic and anti inflammatory compound
4502,overdosage intoxication of sulindac tiaramide and diclofenac caused excitability of central nervous system followed by unconsciousness
4503,the case was treated with ordinary therapies and direct hemoperfusion dhp
4504,serum concentrations of these drugs and their metabolites were correlated well with the clinical symptoms
4505,dhp may be effective to eliminate these drugs and their metabolites
4506,gastrointestinal gi side effects of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac may be reduced if it is administered as a complex with phospholipid
4507,the upper and lower gi permeability induced by a diclofenac dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline dppc complex were compared with those of diclofenac acid and its sodium salt in rats
4508,pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to assess bioavailability of diclofenac preparations
4509,adult male sprague dawley rats were dosed orally equivalent to mg kg diclofenac sodium as the acid or its sodium salt as well as diclofenac dppc complex
4510,upper and lower gi permeability as surrogate markers of toxicity were determined using sucrose and cr edta respectively
4511,at h post dose only diclofenac sodium induced a significant increased upper gi permeability
4512,three h post dose all formulations significantly increased upper gi permeability although the diclofenac acid had the least effect
4513,in the lower gi tract the induced increase in permeability was significant at and h post dose for all formulations with no significant differences between them
4514,the induced upper and lower gi toxicity of diclofenac was formulation and time dependent
4515,the lack of effect of diclofenac acid was due to the decreased availability of the drug
4516,in the upper gi tract up to h post dose the diclofenac dppc complex demonstrated reduced upper gastroduodenal permeability as measured by sucrose
4517,however the protective effect of dppc did not last and was not extended to the lower gi tract due to the systemic effect contribution from the enterohepatic recirculation and or dissociation of the complex
4518,in assessing diclofenac gi toxicity the effect of the different formulations on the entire gi tract at various times after drug administration must be considered
4519,prospective in vivo rodent model of bone morphogenetic protein bmp induced inflammation
4520,to evaluate the effects of the coadministration of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac on bmp induced inflammation using our rodent model
4521,the use of bmp is associated with inflammation in the neck and back
4522,we have previously reported on a rodent model of bmp induced inflammation

4526,the mass size and tissue density of bone formation were compared between groups using plain radiography
4527,soft tissue edema volumes in all diclofenac treated groups were significantly lower than those observed in the rhbmp alone
4528,there was no significant difference in soft tissue edema volumes between diclofenac treated groups
4529,the expression of nf b signaling pathway related proteins p and p p were increased in the rhbmp acs group and decreased in diclofenac treatment groups
4530,histological findings and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with the western blot results
4531,there was no significant difference between the rhbmp acs group and diclofenac treatment groups in terms of the mass size and tissue density of bone formation
4532,coadministration of diclofenac sodium can reduce the inflammatory response to bmp without impairing heterotopic bone formation in our rodent model of bmp induced inflammation
4534,ionic liquid il is an environment friendly organic solvent which has a relatively low vapor pressure
4535,this work focuses on adsorption of montmorillonite mt to il as well as removal of diclofenac sodium ds an anionic contaminant in water by il modified mt
4536,the experiment shows absorption of ds increased by increasing il dosage in modifying mt
4537,as a result to modified mt
4538,with a concentration of il of cationic exchange capacity cec its static absorption of modified mt
4539,to ds is mmol kg with a rapid rate reaching balance in min
4540,in dynamic column experiment absorption of ds reaches balance after h which absorption amount is mmol kg
4541,it can be inferred that modification of il change surface charge of mt
4542,and renders intercalation of ds into mt
4543,interlayers thus increasing adsorption capacity to ds
4544,these features could further expand the application of ils and enable il modified mt
4545,to be used as inexpensive sorbents for the removal of chromate and other oxyanions from water
4546,interpenetrating network ipn microbeads of sodium carboxymethyl locust bean gum scmlbg and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose scmc containing diclofenac sodium ds a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug were prepared by single water in water w w emulsion gelation process using alcl as cross linking agent in a complete aqueous environment

4557,diclofenac sodium was administered intraperitoneally to rats at either mg or mg kg body weight for consecutive days
4558,vitamin b complex mg b mg b and g b kg body weight i p
4559,was co administered daily for weeks along with diclofenac administration to rats intoxicated by either of the two doses
4560,the results revealed that co administration of vitamin b complex with diclofenac to rats intoxicated by either of the two doses markedly ameliorated increases in serum markers of cardiac damage including ast creatine kinase mb ck mb as well as decreases in phosphoglucoisomerase pgi and lactate dehydrogenase ldh activities in cardiac tissue compared with intoxicated rats
4561,the b complex also could markedly attenuate the decreases in cardiac antioxidant enzymes namely glutathione reductase gr glucose phosphate dehydrogenase g pdh and catalase cat compared with diclofenac intoxicated rats
4562,beside the vitamin b complex successfully modulated the increases in serum glucose serum lipid profiles triglycerides tgs total cholesterol tch and low density lipoprotein ldl c as well as the decrease in the high density lipoprotein hdl c in response to diclofenac toxicity
4563,these results support the use of vitamin b complex along with diclofenac therapy as a protective agent against cardiac tissue damage induced by diclofenac toxicity
4564,to study diclofenac sodium induced histological and mechanical alterations and their prevention with imipenem in rat intestine
4565,male wistar rats n were randomly assigned to four experimental groups gi n treated with saline im gii n treated with mg kg body weight diclofenac sodium im for four days giii n treated with mg kg body weight imipenem im for four days and giv n treated with diclofenac sodium plus imipenem at the above doses im for days
4566,each group was further divided into subgroups of rats each and sacrificed at and days of follow up respectively
4567,abdominal cavity macroscopy and histology and small bowel breaking strength were analyzed at each sacrifice moment
4568,there were no histological or mechanical alterations in normal control rats throughout the study
4569,ulcerated lesions in intestinal mucosa were observed and breaking strength decreased in all diclofenac sodium treated rats
4570,ulcerated lesions in intestinal mucosa were prevented by imipenem in all rats
4571,diclofenac sodium induced ulcerated lesions in rat intestinal mucosa can be prevented by imipenem treatment
4572,a new formulation of the nonselective nsaid diclofenac sodium suitable for intravenous bolus injection has been developed using hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin as a solubility enhancer hpbetacd diclofenac
4573,hpbetacd diclofenac intravenous bolus injection was shown to be bioequivalent to the existing parenteral formulation of diclofenac containing propylene glycol and benzyl alcohol as solubilizers pg ba diclofenac which is relatively insoluble and requires slow intravenous infusion over minutes
4574,single dose hpbetacd diclofenac and mg administered by intravenous bolus injection produced significantly greater responses than placebo for total pain relief totpar over hours or pain intensity at hours in the treatment of moderate or severe postoperative dental pain in randomized double blind trials
4575,hpbetacd diclofenac and mg were similar in efficacy to intravenous bolus ketorolac mg in a well controlled trial single dose hpbetacd diclofenac mg intravenous bolus injection was shown to be superior to pg ba diclofenac mg intravenous infusion with respect to totpar over hours indicating faster onset of analgesia in the treatment of moderate or severe postoperative dental pain
4576,both hpbetacd diclofenac and pg ba diclofenac were superior to placebo
4577,hpbetacd diclofenac was generally well tolerated during single dose treatment of postoperative pain
4578,the tolerability profile was similar to that of pg ba diclofenac but with a lower incidence of thrombophlebitis
4579,systemic bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of topical diclofenac sodium gel were compared with those of oral diclofenac sodium mg tablets
4580,in a randomized way crossover study healthy volunteers n received three day diclofenac regimens a g gel applied as g to knee times daily g on surface area cm b g gel applied as g per knee times daily to knees plus g gel per hand applied times daily to hands g on cm and c mg oral diclofenac applied as mg tablets times daily
4581,thirty nine participants completed all regimens
4582,systemic exposure was greater with oral diclofenac auc ng x h ml than with topical treatments a auc ng x h ml and b auc ng x h ml
4583,oral diclofenac inhibited platelet aggregation cyclooxygenase cox and cox
4584,topical diclofenac did not inhibit platelet aggregation and inhibited cox and cox less than oral diclofenac
4585,treatment related adverse events were mild and limited to application site reactions with diclofenac sodium gel n and gastrointestinal reactions with oral diclofenac n
4586,systemic exposure with diclofenac sodium gel was to fold lower than with oral diclofenac
4587,systemic effects with topical diclofenac were less pronounced
4588,the effects of diclofenac sodium on the kidneys were studied during hours in eight patients with normal renal function
4589,urinary output decreased within min after the injection and maximally by
4590,the renal plasma flow and the glomerular filtration rate initially diminished significantly by but began to increase after only hours
4591,the dominant and persistent effect was reduction of free water clearance with maximum fall from to ml min after hours
4592,the long lasting increased tubular reabsorption of water probably is important for the lowered intrapelvic pressure that is associated with good analgetic effect of diclofenac in ureteral colic
4593,diclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid advocated for use in painful and inflammatory rheumatic and certain non rheumatic conditions
4594,it is available in a number of administration forms which can be given orally rectally or intramuscularly
4595,conveniently dosage adjustments are not required in the elderly or in those patients with renal or hepatic impairment
4596,the drug has a relatively short elimination half life which limits the potential for drug accumulation
4597,in numerous clinical trials the efficacy of diclofenac is equivalent to that of the many newer and established nsaids with which it has been compared
4598,as an analgesic it has a fast onset and long duration of action
4599,when administered intramuscularly it is at least comparable to and frequently superior to many narcotic and spasmolytic combinations in renal and biliary colic
4600,extensive clinical experience has been gained with diclofenac clearly establishing its safety profile
4601,it is well tolerated compared with other nsaids and rarely produces gastrointestinal ulceration or other serious side effects
4602,thus diclofenac can be considered as one of the few nsaids of first choice in the treatment of acute and chronic painful and inflammatory conditions
4603,sustained release diclofenac sodium df na solid lipid matrices with compritol ato were developed in this study
4604,the drug lipid powders were processed via cold and hot melt extrusion at various drug loadings
4605,the influence of the processing temperatures drug loading and the addition of excipients on the obtained dissolution rates was investigated
4606,the physicochemical characterization of the extruded batches showed the existence of crystalline drug in the extrudates with a small amount being solubilized in the lipid matrix
4607,the drug content and uniformity on the tablet surface were also investigated by using energy dispersive x ray microanalysis
4608,the dissolution rates were found to depend on the actual df na loading and the nature of the added excipients while the effect of the processing temperatures was negligible
4609,the dissolution mechanism of all extruded formulations followed peppas korsemeyer law based on the estimated determination coefficients and the dissolution constant rates indicating drug diffusion from the lipid matrices
4610,the aim of this study was to evaluate the probable protective effect of vitamin c and vitamin e on diclofenac induced acute nephrotoxicity using biochemical molecular and histopathological examination in rats following administration of diclofenac sodium mg kg i m
4611,ninety male wister rats were allotted in six equal groups

4617,blood samples were collected two days post treatment st week of experiment nd and th week of the experiment for assessment of urea creatinine malondialdehyde nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase activities
4618,at the end of th week rats were sacrificed and kidneys were excised for biochemical analyses histopathological evaluation and determination of kidney interleukin interleukin demsin and nepherin expressions in by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr
4619,the results showed that diclofenac induced severe kidney damage as indicated by histopathological changes and increased serum oxidative stress parameters
4620,behavioral changes were monitored a significant increase in uremia in intoxicated animals was also noted indicating that diclofenac sodium provoked kidney damage in rats
4621,application of vitamin c dvc group and vitamin e dve group were found to improve the abovementioned abnormalities
4622,the present data suggest that vitamin c and vitamin e might play an important role in reducing oxidative stress and kidney damage induced by diclofenac sodium
4623,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids have shown antibacterial activity in some recent studies
4624,the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of diclofenac against enterococcus faecalis e faecalis as a resistant endodontic bacterium in comparison with ibuprofen calcium hydroxide and amoxicillin
4625,the antibacterial activity of materials was evaluated using agar diffusion test and tube dilution method
4626,mixtures of mg ml of materials were prepared
4627,the bacteria were seeded on muller hinton agar culture plates
4628,thirty microliter of each test material was placed in each well punched in agar plates
4629,after incubation the zone of bacterial inhibition was measured
4630,minimum inhibitory concentration mic of the test materials was determined by agar dilution method
4631,one way analysis of variance anova followed by sidak post hoc test was used to compare the mean zone of microbial growth in the groups
4632,there were significant differences between the two groups p
4633,results of the agar diffusion test showed that antibiotics amoxicillin gentamycin had the greatest antibacterial activity followed by nsaids ibuprofen diclofenac
4634,ca oh failed to show antibacterial activity
4635,diclofenac and ibuprofen showed distinct antibacterial activity against e faecalis in g ml and above concentrations
4636,within the limitations of this in vitro study it is concluded that diclofenac and ibuprofen have significantly more pronounced antibacterial activity against e faecalis in comparison with ca oh
4637,the study of phenylbutazone and of the major anti inflammatory agents which followed a decade later provided target criteria for a research project aimed at the synthesis of a new anti inflammatory agent with superior activity and tolerability
4638,diclofenac fulfils the steric and physicochemical criteria and the absence of a heterocyclic ring from its chemical structure may have a beneficial influence on its tolerability
4639,controlled release tablets having near zero order release of diclofenac sodium a water soluble drug were prepared using hydrophilic polymers like hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc sodium carboxymethylcellulose nacmc and carbopol tablets were also prepared with mixtures of polymers of nacmc hpmc and carbopol the optimum ratio of drug hpmc
4640,nacmc was found to be a combination of nonionic polymer hpmc and anionic nacmc polymer matrix resulted in near zero order release of diclofenac sodium
4641,the results obtained were in agreement with the earlier reports
4642,it is observed that increasing polymer content produces more sustained effect
4643,a combination of nonionic polymer hpmc and anionic polymer nacmc as the polymer matrix resulted in near zero order release of diclofenac sodium
4644,drug release from the matrix did not follow fick s law of diffusion and exhibited near zero order release
4645,results of the bioavailability studies indicated that formulation with drug hpmc nacmc equal to was similar to the marketed product dicloran sr and showed better bioavailability than voveran sr a statistically significant difference was seen between voveran sr and the other two products
4646,a good in vitro in vivo correlation was observed for these products
4647,there are two reasons explaining why several researchers have carried out the in vitro release studies of diclofenac sodium dfna using ph media of above firstly the ph dependence of solubility and secondly the intramolecular cyclization suffered under acidic conditions which causes the salt to become inactivated
4648,nevertheless many commercially available pharmaceutical dosage forms have no protective coat to avoid the inactivation in the gastric juices
4649,a possible explanation may be found if reconstitution of the cyclated form takes place
4650,it is therefore necessary to study the behaviour of diclofenac sodium when it is submitted to the action of different solutions in a wide ph range
4651,to perform this study five analytical methods have been employed uv vis spectrophotometry differential scanning calorimetry dsc infrared analysis ir x ray diffractometry drx and energy dispersive x ray analysis eds
4652,diatomite makes a promising candidate for a drug carrier because of its high porosity large surface area modifiable surface chemistry and biocompatibility
4653,herein refined diatomite from kolubara coal basin which complied with the pharmacopoeial requirements for heavy metals content and microbiological quality was used as a starting material
4654,inorganic modification of the starting material was performed through a simple one step procedure
4655,significant increase in adsorbent loading with diclofenac sodium ds was achieved after the modification process mg g which enabled the preparation of comprimates containing therapeutic dose of the adsorbed drug
4656,adsorption of ds onto modified diatomite resulted in the alteration of the drug s xrd pattern and ftir spectrum
4657,in vitro drug release studies in phosphate buffer ph demonstrated prolonged ds release over h from comprimates containing ds adsorbed on modified diatomite up to after h and those containing physical mixture of the same composition up to after h
4658,the results of in vivo toxicity testing on mice pointed on potential safety of both unmodified starting and modified diatomite
4659,all these findings favor the application of diatomite as a potential functional drug carrier
4660,sodium and potassium diclofenac salts form hydrates when crystallized from water the sodium salt contains four crystallization water molecules while the potassium salt precipitates as a dihydrate
4661,crystallization from organic solvents occurs with a change of the crystal habit
4662,the fractal dimension of the particle surface of both salts obtained from water is low and is in agreement with the formation of smooth and regular surfaces during crystallization
4663,the fractal dimension for dissolution is relatively high and comparable for hydrate and anhydrate forms of both salts and the result was interpreted as being due to the surfactant behavior of diclofenac anions
4664,thermograms of both salts show a couple of endotherms in the range degrees c which disappear when the salts have been previously heated at degrees c but slowly reappear when the anhydrate forms are stored in a humid environment
4665,both salts present a complex exotherm of decomposition at and degrees c respectively
4666,the results are briefly discussed with regard to the formulations of the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac
4667,the thermal behaviour and melting characteristics of diclofenac sodium were investigated using various instrumental techniques differential scanning calorimetry dsc thermogravimetric analysis tga fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and thin layer chromatography tlc
4668,dsc analysis of diclofenac sodium performed under dynamic flow of either synthetic air or helium or nitrogen did not produce any sharp endothermic peak characteristic of melting peak of a pure substance
4669,both the rate of scanning of the sample and the environmental atmospheric condition significantly affected the thermographic profile of diclofenac sodium
4670,an exothermic peak prior to an endothermic peak corresponding to melting of the substance appeared when heated under dynamic flow of synthetic air suggesting oxidation decomposition of diclofenac sodium before reaching its melting point
4671,in fact at a scanning rate of degree c min only the exothermic peak appeared in the thermogram suggesting complete decomposition prior to melting under the dynamic flow of synthetic air
4672,dsc ft ir and tlc data obtained from samples heated under the dynamic flow of either helium or nitrogen revealed formation of a related compound dichlorophenyl indolin one an indol cyclic amide as a result of an intramolecular cyclization reaction during the heating process
4673,tga data demonstrated a loss of of the mass of diclofenac sodium when heated under various environmental conditions and also supported the oxidative nature of degraded product s when the thermal process occurred slowly under a dynamic flow of synthetic air
4674,allergic reactions due to drugs may lead to different clinical conditions
4675,acute coronary syndromes triggered by type hypersensitivity reactions due to drug intake are known as kounis syndrome
4676,vasospasm occurring in normal coronary arteries type and plaque rupture type are two variants of this syndrome both caused by vasoactive and inflammatory mediators due to hypersensitivity reaction
4677,in this case report we will present type kounis syndrome leading to acute anterior myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest in a healthy male after diclofenac sodium injection via intramuscular route
4679,the efficacy of diclofenac sodium was investigated in the painful symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea and in reducing menstrual bleeding
4680,thirty five nulliparous women yr of age were included in a double blind cross over study for four menstrual periods two periods with diclofenac sodium and two periods with placebo
4681,the diclofenac sodium treatment total of periods reduced the pain significantly in comparison with placebo periods as evaluated by subjective rating p less than and by a point scale of pain intensity p less than
4682,also the amount of menstrual bleeding was significantly reduced as measured by subjective rating p less than and by counting the number of sanitary pads used p less than
4683,the results indicate that diclofenac sodium in low dose about mg daily is effective not only in reducing the pain at menstruation but also the bleeding
4684,diclofenac sodium is the active ingredient in voltaren a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug designed by selection of appropriate physicochemical and steric properties
4685,its pharmacologic activity specifically its effects in acute and subchronic inflammation and its analgesic activity have been assessed in animal models
4686,the tolerability of the compound as judged by several parameters i e ratio between the acute lethal dose or the dose inducing gastrointestinal blood loss and the desired pharmacologic activity is favorable in comparison with other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs
4687,diclofenac sodium acts by potent cyclo oxygenase inhibition reduction of arachidonic acid release and enhancement of arachidonic acid uptake
4688,it thereby results in a dual inhibitory effect on both the cyclo oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways
4689,effective clinical utilisation of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium ds is significantly limited by their ulcerogenic potential and poor bioavailability after oral administration
4690,the objective of this work was to develop reconstitutable pediatric suspensions of ds loaded microspheres prepared with an acrylic polymer eudragit rs for improved pediatric delivery of ds
4691,the microspheres were prepared by the water in oil in water or solid in oil in water emulsion techniques
4692,enviromental scanning electron microscopy observations clearly showed that microspheres have spherical shape
4693,the drug entrapment efficiency of these microspheres was found to and their average particle sizes were m which are within the desired range for the development of suspension formulation
4694,the in vitro dissolution indicated prolonged sustained release of ds over h the results of preliminary characterisation studies of suspensions show that a liquid pharmaceutical preparation for oral administration capable of providing a sustained release of ds was successfully obtained
4695,in vitro analysis of drug release and antimicrobial activity of the coblended crosslinked polymeric fibre device pfd were investigated
4696,the fibre loaded with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium was comprised of alginate and glycerol crosslinked with barium cations
4697,the ph dependent drug release was evident with ciprofloxacin and diclofenac sodium diffusing from the fibre at ph compared to ph where the fibre swelled and eroded resulting in zero order drug release
4698,agar diffusion studies followed by minimum inhibitory assays were conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of the device against escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus mutans
4699,the antimicrobial activity of the pfd was confirmed in both test assays against all test pathogens
4700,the mic ranges at ph for e coli e faecalis and s mutans were and g ml respectively
4701,at ph similar efficacies g ml for e coli and e faecalis and g ml for s mutans were observed
4702,the effect of varying the plasticizer and crosslinking ion concentration on drug release profile of the fibers was further elucidated and conceptualized using molecular mechanics energy relationships mmer and by exploring the spatial disposition of geometrically minimized molecular conformations
4703,the systemic pharmacokinetics and local drug distribution of sodium diclofenac in skin and underlying tissues was studied
4704,iontophoresis facilitated local and systemic delivery of diclofenac sodium compared with passive diffusion
4705,the maximum plasma concentration of sodium diclofenac was achieved within h of iontophoresis and the delivery was proportional to applied current density and microg l at and ma cm respectively
4706,the in vivo delivery efficiency for diclofenac in rabbit was mg ma h
4707,the concentrations of sodium diclofenac in the skin subcutaneous tissue and muscle beneath the drug application site cathode were significantly greater than plasma concentrations and concentrations of drug in similar tissues at the untreated sites
4708,the results thus suggest that the cutaneous microvasculature is not always a perfect sink and that transdermal iontophoresis facilitated the direct penetration of diclofenac sodium to deeper tissues
4709,no skin irritation was observed up to ma cm current density and mg ml sodium diclofenac concentration
4710,liquid suppository systems composed of poloxamers and bioadhesive polymers were easy to administer to the anus and mucoadhesive to the rectal tissues without leakage after the dose
4711,however a liquid suppository system containing diclofenac sodium could not be developed using bioadhesive polymers since the drug was precipitated in this preparation
4712,to develop a liquid suppository system using sodium chloride instead of bioadhesive polymers the physicochemical properties such as gelation temperature gel strength and bioadhesive force of various formulations composed of diclofenac sodium poloxamers and sodium chloride were investigated
4713,the mixtures of p and p existed as a liquid at room temperature but gelled at physiological temperature
4714,diclofenac sodium significantly increased the gelation temperature and weakened the gel strength and bioadhesive force while sodium chloride did the opposite
4715,furthermore the poloxamer gels with less than of sodium chloride in which the drug was not precipitated were inserted into the rectum of rabbits without difficulty and leakage and retained in the rectum of rats for at least h our results suggested that a thermosensitive liquid suppository system with sodium chloride and poloxamers was a more physically stable and convenient rectal dosage form for diclofenac sodium
4716,diclofenac sodium voltaren is a non steroid anti inflammatory agent of a new chemical structure which is animal experiments shows a high degree of anti inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic activity in various pharmacological models
4717,it inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo and this inhibitory effect at least partly explains the mechanism of action of the preparation
4718,in animal experiments diclofenac sodium is characterised by a broad therapeutic range
4719,also its gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of other highly effective non steroid anti inflammatory agents
4720,two of the metabolites produced during the biotransformation of diclofenac sodium in man are also biologically active
4721,the activity of these two metabolites however is very much weaker than that of unchanged diclofenac sodium and is comparable to that of phenylbutazone
4722,the authors studied the cytotoxic effect of diclofenac sodium a prostaglandin synthetic inhibitor on chang s cultured human conjunctival cells
4723,diclofenac sodium inhibited cell growth dose dependently
4724,although cell growth was interrupted hrs later by one minute of exposure to a solution of diclofenac sodium the cells began to grow again hrs later
4725,twenty four hours later a one minute exposure to a solution of diclofenac sodium revealed no cytotoxic effects electron microscopically
4726,the effect on the cell cycle of exposure to diclofenac sodium was studied using a flow cytometer
4727,twelve hours after exposure to diclofenac sodium dna histograms showed a broader g peak and increase in mitotic phase cells and dead cells with a low dna content on the left of the g peak
4728,hrs later the number of dead cells and dna synthetic phase cells increased and mitotic cells gradually decreased almost disappearing within hrs
4729,the objective of this investigation was to develop a novel cationic polymer hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin grafted polyethyleneimine hp cd pei as a penetration enhancer and evaluate its viability on improving transdermal delivery of diclofenac sodium
4730,in this study hp cd pei was characterized by h nmr and dsc methods respectively
4731,the hydrophilic drug diclofenac sodium was chosen as model drug and the transdermal permeation enhancement of hp cd pei was estimated in vitro by using franz diffusion cells fitted with mouse dorsal skins the in vivo kinetics of diclofenac sodium was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc
4732,the cumulative drug content deposited in epidermis and dermis was measured at the pre determined time point of and h and the permeation profile was significantly higher than that of the control groups
4733,in addition the cytotoxicity and skin irritation of enhancer was evaluated by mtt assay and histological examination respectively and the results indicated that the polymer we prepared were non toxic and non irritant after exposure to skins
4734,all the results suggested that hp cd pei could be a safe and efficient penetration enhancer of diclofenac sodium
4735,for increased analgesic effect new composed tablets containing diclofenac sodium dic with an addition of papaverine hydrochloride pap were prepared to investigate the mechanism of release of the active substances from tablets with different excipients in eight different formulations
4736,to detect the possible interactions between active substances and excipients differential scanning calorimetry dsc was used
4737,a shift of the melting point and enthalpy values of the physical mixtures of tablets components suggested a kind of interaction between components in certain formulations however the tabletting process was not disturbed in any of them
4738,kinetics of drug release from formulations was estimated by zero order first order and higuchi and korsmeyer peppas models using results of dissolution of dic and pap from tablets
4739,the study revealed that the mechanism of release of active substances was dependent on the excipients contained in tablets and the best fitted kinetics models were obtained for formulations with potentially prolonged release of dic and pap
4740,the main objective of the present research work was to develop a bilayer tablet of metoclopramide hydrochloride mth and diclofenac sodium ds in separate layers to avoid incompatibility and thus to maximize the efficacy of both drugs in combination for the effective treatment of migraine headaches
4741,mth and ds were formulated as immediate and sustained release layers respectively
4742,in vitro dissolution kinetic studies of an optimized d batch of ds in both sustained release layer and bilayer tablet forms show good linearity of regression coefficient first order equation
4743,the results reveal that an optimized immediate release layer m of mth and a sustained release layer d of ds might be suitable for the treatment of migraine by sequential release of the two drugs in a bilayer tablet
4744,migraine is a type of recurring headache of moderate to severe intensity associated with gastrointestinal neurological and autonomic symptoms
4745,in migraine a combination of pretreatment with antiemetics is required for symptomatic treatment when nausea and vomiting are severe
4746,in our present research we have selected the metoclopramide hydrochloride mth active ingredient for study because it has an antiemetic effect and is a prokinetic agent
4747,mth is more effective to counteract gastric stasis associated with migraine and it enhances the rate of absorption of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
4748,in the present investigation we combine mth and a second active ingredient diclofenac sodium as a formulated bilayer tablet to prevent degradation of mth
4749,the aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate novel biodegradable polyesters namely poly ethylene glycol poly glycerol adipate co pentadecalactone peg pga co pdl peg and poly ethylene glycol methyl ether poly glycerol adipate co pentadecalactone pga co pdl pegme as an alternative sustained release carrier for lung delivery compared with non peg containing polymer pga co pdl
4750,the co polymers were synthesized through lipase catalysis ring opening polymerization reaction and characterized using gpc ft ir h nmr and surface contact angle
4751,furthermore microparticles containing a model hydrophilic drug sodium diclofenac were prepared via spray drying from a modified single emulsion and characterized for their encapsulation efficiency geometrical particle size zeta potential tapped density primary aerodynamic diameter amorphous nature morphology in vitro release and the aerosolization performance
4752,microparticles fabricated from mpeg co polymer can be targeted to the lung periphery with an optimum in vitro deposition
4753,furthermore a significantly higher in vitro release p anova dunnett s was observed with the peg and mpeg co polymers compared to pga co pdl
4754,in addition these co polymers have a good safety profile upon testing on human bronchial epithelial hbeo cell lines
4755,a comparative study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen both non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in osteoarthritis
4756,forty patients of either sex between the ages of years suffering from osteoarthritis of at least one knee joint minimum of eight weeks duration were included in the study
4757,diclofenac sodium exhibited better results by improving the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis in both high and low doses compared to flurbiprofen
4758,the adverse effects observed were similar in both groups
4759,a comparative multi centre study was conducted during june to december to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of ketoprofen mg enteric coated ec tablet and mg intra muscular injection with that of diclofenac sodium mg tablet and mg intra muscular injection in acute rheumatic and traumatic disorders
4760,total of patients per drug were studied men and women between the ages of and years
4761,the symptoms and the number of patients were backache arthritis frozen shoulder and sprains pain was qualitatively assessed by visual analogue scale vas xy pain index pain at mobilization and the level of pain handicap
4762,for pain vas the treatment was initiated with an injectable bid followed by tablets bid or tid
4763,if the pain score on vas was less than tablets were given in a bid dosage
4764,the duration of treatment was days in each case
4765,the overall complete relief of symptoms occurred in patients with ketoprofen and in diclofenac sodium
4766,moderate to mild relief was found in cases with ketoprofen and with diclofenac sodium
4767,no pain relief was seen in with diclofenac sodium as against no failure in pain relief in the ketoprofen group
4768,tolerance was found as excellent good for ketoprofen in with diclofenac sodium in moderate to poor for ketoprofen in and with diclofenac sodium in
4769,our results indicate that ketoprofen compared to diclofenac sodium is efficacious in acute rheumatic and traumatic injuries
4770,ketoprofen injection compared to diclofenac sodium was found to be more effective in providing analgesia
4771,the use of gamma rays for the sterilization of pharmaceutical raw materials and dosage forms is an alternative method for sterilization
4772,however one of the major problems of the radiosterilization is the production of new radiolytic products during the irradiation process
4773,therefore the principal problem in radiosterilization is to determine and to characterize these physical and chemical changes originating from high energy radiation
4774,parenteral drug delivery systems were prepared and in vitro characterization biodistribution and treatment studies were done in our previous studies
4775,drug delivery systems liposomes niosomes lipogelosomes and niogelosomes encapsulating diclofenac sodium dfna were prepared for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra
4776,this work complies information about the studies developed in order to find out if gamma radiation could be applied as a sterilization method to dfna and the raw materials as dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine dmpc surfactant i polyglyceryl cethyl ether sur i dicethyl phosphate dcp and cholesterol chol that are used to prepare those systems
4777,the raw materials were irradiated with different radiation doses and kgy and physicochemical changes organoleptic properties ph uv and melting point microbiological evaluation sterility assurance level sal sterility and pyrogen test and electron spin resonance esr characteristics were studied at normal c relative humidity and accelerated c relative humidity stability test conditions
4778,printing technologies have recently emerged in the development of novel drug delivery systems toward personalized medicine to improve the performance of formulations existing bioavailability patterns and patients compliance
4779,in the context of two dimensional printing this article presents the development of buccal films that are designed to efficiently deliver a class ii compound diclofenac sodium according to the biopharmaceutics classification system bcs to the oral cavity
4780,the preparation of drug loaded inks was carried out based on solubility studies and evaluation of rheological properties combining ethanol and propylene glycol as optimal solvents
4781,deposition of the drug was achieved by increasing the number of printing layers onto edible substrates to produce formulations with dose variance
4782,thermal analysis x ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the developed films
4783,drug loading and water uptake studies complemented the initial assessment of the films and preliminary in vitro studies were conducted to further evaluate their performance
4784,the in vitro release profiles were recorded in simulated saliva presenting the complete release of the incorporated active in a period of min
4785,the effect of multiple layers on the overall performance of films was completed with in vitro permeation studies revealing the correlation between the number of printed layers and the apparent permeability coefficient
4786,the renal effects of an acute extracellular fluid volume expansion ml ringer kg body weight min were studied in aldosterone treated microgram kg anesthetized rabbits with and without pretreatment with either indomethacin mg kg or diclofenac sodium mg kg two different inhibitors of renal prostaglandin pg biosynthesis
4787,in controls n the volume expansion increased urine flow from to s e
4788,ml min g kidney weight and sodium excretion from to mmol min g pah and inulin clearance increased by and respectively while plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of pgf alpha like immunoreactivity were reduced p less than
4789,in animals pretreated with indomethacin n or diclofenac sodium n the diuresis and the natriuresis following volume expansion were significantly increased about two fold over controls whereas pah and inulin clearance plasma renin activity and hematocrit did not differ from controls
4790,both drugs were found to reduce urinary excretion of pgf alpha like immunoreactivity by througout the experiment
4791,the results indicate that diclofenac sodium indomethacin and extracellular volume expansion enhance sodium and water excretion partly by suppression of a pg sensitive reabsorption process in the kidney
4792,twenty diclofenac sodium buccoadhesive discs containing cpp polycarbophil peo scmc medium viscosity scmc mv scmc ultrahigh viscosity scmc uhv or their combinations were prepared
4793,these buccoadhesive discs were evaluated for release pattern swelling capacity surface ph mucoadhesion performance and in vitro permeation of diclofenac sodium through buccal membranes
4794,in vivo testing of mucoadhesion time strength of adhesion irritation bitterness due to drug swallowing and disc disintegration in the buccal cavity were also performed
4795,drug bioavailability of a selected diclofenac sodium buccoadhesive product was then compared with that of voltarin sr tablet
4796,the percentage relative bioavailability of diclofenac sodium from the selected buccoadhesive disc mg was found to be
4797,a simple and easy method of analysis for diclofenac sodium is reported
4798,a spectrofluorometric method for the microdetermination of diclofenac sodium has been developed through its reaction with cerium iv in an acidic solution and measurement of the fluorescence of the ce iii ions produced
4799,under the optimum experimental conditions for the oxidation reaction m hso with min of heating time degrees c the range of application is ng ml and the limit of detection is ng ml
4800,the proposed method was applied to the determination of diclofenac sodium in pharmaceutical tablets
4801,the results of the analysis show a good agreement with those obtained by the official usp hplc method
4802,ultrasound temporally increases skin permeability by altering stratum corneum sc function sonophoresis
4803,the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of variable ultrasound conditions on the permeation of diclofenac sodium ds with range of physicochemical properties through epiderm
4804,permeation studies were carried out in vitro using franz diffusion cell
4805,hplc method was used for the determination of the concentration of diclofenac sodium in receiving compartment
4806,parameters like ultrasound frequency application time amplitude and mode of sonication and distance of ultrasound horn from skin were investigated and the conditions where the maximum enhancement rate obtained were determined
4807,application of ultrasound enhanced permeation of diclofenac sodium across epiderm by fivefolds
4808,the most effective enhancing parameters were power sonication of khz frequency amplitude at continuous mode for min
4809,diclofenac sodium is a arylacetic acid nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug
4810,it is widely used in pain management
4811,side effects such as urticaria asthmatic attack vasospastic angina ischemic stroke and kounis syndrome may be seen after the use of diclofenac sodium
4812,however anaphylactic shock is rare
4813,anaphylactic shock secondary to injection of diclofenac sodium can be treated successfully with intramuscular injection of adrenaline
4814,because diclofenac sodium is commonly used in analgesic treatment in emergency departments we present this case report to emphasize that anaphylactic shock may be seen after the use of that drug
4815,effective management of endodontic pain represents a continuing challenge
4816,many of the dental professionals are facing significant problems associated with postendodontic pain
4817,hence the postendodontic pain has to be prevented at its primary stage without waiting for its occurrence
4818,this trial was carried out to evaluate the use of a preoperative single oral dose of diclofenac sodium for the prevention and control of postendodontic pain
4819,fifty patients were randomly assigned to two groups placebo and diclofenac sodium mg
4820,the medications were administered min before the start of standard endodontic treatment
4821,postoperative pain was assessed after and h by using a visual analog scale
4822,postendodontic pain showed a statistically significant difference between both groups at and h p and there was no significant difference at h
4823,postendodontic pain was substantially reduced by preoperative administration of single oral dose of diclofenac sodium
4824,it is thus possible to conclude that these favorable results might help to prevent postendodontic pain especially in patients with a low pain threshold
4825,in this study we investigated the morphometric and histological alterations of the aorta brachial and femoral arteries in and week old rats that were prenatally exposed to diclofenac sodium ds
4826,for this purpose pregnant rats were divided into three groups control saline injected and drug treated
4827,beginning from day after mating through day of pregnancy saline or ds mg kg daily was intraperitoneally injected into groups and no injection was given to the rats in the control group
4828,after spontaneous delivery male offspring were obtained
4829,at the end of weeks and vessel samples were removed
4830,after dissection and routine histological preparation histopathological and stereological investigations were made
4831,our results indicate that both saline and ds application lead to a decrease in the mean volume fraction of tunica media in all vessel walls but result in an increase of the same fraction of lumen to the whole vessel wall especially in week old rats
4832,elastic fibers of the vessel wall were affected by ds treatment because a decrease of the elastic fiber was observed in this group
4833,finally in light of our findings we suggest that ds or saline may lead to vascular changes i e vasodilatation or vasoconstriction in rats that are prenatally subjected to increased volume of maternal blood resulting from injection
4834,the aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the analgesic effect of diclofenac sodium injected epidurally in single or repeated doses and whether tolerance develops in long term use
4835,a total of rats were included in the study
4836,the rats were anesthetized using intraperitoneal ketamine hydrochloride and an epidural catheter ec was inserted at the level of th dorsal thoraco lumbar vertebrae t
4837,eleven rats were excluded from the study
4838,the remaining rats were randomly divided into three groups group control group c n received l normal saline solution ns via ec for days group single dose group sd n received l ns for days and g diclofenac via ec on th day group ten doses group tds n received g diclofenac via ec in l ns for days
4839,on the th day min after epidural diclofenac sodium mg kg of acetic acid was injected via intraperitoneal route and the rats were observed for min and number of writhing reflex wr was recorded
4840,the values of total number of writhing reflex wrt and writhing reflex per minute wr min were found to be significantly higher in group c compared with groups sd and td p
4841,single and repeated doses of diclofenac sodium via epidural route have an analgesic effect in a visceral pain model in rats without developing tolerance
4842,the expanded hansen method was tested for determination of the solubility parameters of two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs naproxen and sodium diclofenac
4843,this work describes for the first time the application of the method to the sodium salt of a drug
4844,the original dependent variable of the expanded hansen method involving the activity coefficient of the drug was compared with the direct use of the logarithm of the mole fraction solubility nx in the solubility models
4845,the solubility of both drugs was measured in pure solvents of several chemical classes and the activity coefficient was obtained from the molar heat and the temperature of fusion
4846,differential scanning calorimetry was performed on the original powder and on the solid phase after equilibration with the pure solvents enabling detection of possible changes of the thermal properties of the solid phase that might change the value of the activity coefficient
4847,the molar heat and temperature of fusion of sodium diclofenac could not be determined because this drug decomposed near the fusion temperature
4848,the best results for both drugs were obtained with the dependent variable nx in association with the four parameter model which includes the acidic and basic partial solubility parameters delta a and delta b instead of the hansen hydrogen bonding parameter delta h
4849,because the dispersion parameter does not vary greatly from one drug to another the variation of solubility among solvents is largely a result of the dipolar and hydrogen bonding parameters a fact that is being consistently found for other drugs of small molecular weight
4850,these results support earlier findings with citric acid and paracetamol that the expanded hansen approach is suitable for determining partial solubility parameters
4851,the modification introduced in the expanded hansen method i e
4852,the use of nx as the dependent variable provides better results than the activity coefficient used in the original method
4853,this is advantageous for drugs such as sodium diclofenac for which the ideal solubility cannot be estimated
4854,this paper shows for the first time that the method is suitable for determination of the partial solubility parameters of a sodium salt of a drug sodium diclofenac
4855,melatonin mel has strong antioxidant properties since it is a direct scavenger of oxygen based free radicals and related species
4856,the main aim of this study is to show whether the effects of mel can prevent the potential adverse effects of diclofenac sodium ds used as a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid during the prenatal period on the newborn experimental rat brain tissues using stereological methods twenty four male week old wistar albino rats were used
4857,the study involved four groups each containing six rats those exposed during the prenatal period to saline ml kg saline group to diclofenac sodium mg kg ds group or to diclofenac sodium melatonin mg kg ds mel group and a control group cont group
4858,at the end of the experiment the brains were removed from the cranium for histological and stereological analyses
4859,cell loss in the hippocampus exposed to ds was observed compared to the cont group p and a similar side effect was also seen in the saline group p
4860,however there was no significant difference in cell numbers between the cont and ds mel groups p
4861,these results suggest that exposure to ds during pregnancy causes a decrease in the number of cells in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus in the postnatal period
4862,using mel a neuroprotective agent reduced the toxic effects of ds
4863,a single blind randomized clinical trial was carried out to compare the analgesic effectiveness in patients with renal colic of single intramuscular doses of diclofenac sodium mg versus a dipyrone g spasmolytics combination and diclofenac sodium mg versus pethidine mg
4864,the first study involved three centres the second study one centre
4865,in total patients were treated with diclofenac sodium with dipyrone spasmolytics and with pethidine
4866,assessments were made during the first hour after drug administration of the degree of pain relief the severity of pain using a visual analogue scale and the duration of analgesia
4867,a global assessment of treatment efficacy was made by the participating physicians at the end of the study period
4868,patients treated with diclofenac sodium showed an earlier onset of analgesia and a higher incidence of total pain relief compared to those treated with dipyrone spasmolytics or pethidine
4869,although the mean duration of analgesia was only slightly greater in the diclofenac sodium group than in the dipyrone spasmolytics group a significantly longer effect was seen when diclofenac sodium was compared with pethidine p less than
4870,pain severity assessments revealed that diclofenac sodium caused a significantly greater improvement in pain after minutes compared to dipyrone spasmolytics p less than and after minutes compared to pethidine p less than
4871,global efficacy assessments by the physician rated diclofenac sodium as significantly superior to dipyrone spasmolytics p less than and pethidine p less than
4872,moreover diclofenac sodium was better tolerated than either of the comparative treatments
4873,the results indicate that intramuscular diclofenac sodium is a useful alternative to the drugs commonly used in india in the treatment of renal colic
4874,to determine the effect of the combination of intranasal desmopressin spray and diclofenac sodium suppository on acute renal colic and compare it with diclofenac sodium suppository alone
4875,a total of patients aged years referred to our hospital with acute renal colic were included in a double blind controlled clinical trial study
4876,patients in group received desmopressin microg intranasally plus diclofenac sodium suppository mg and patients in group received diclofenac sodium suppository mg plus a placebo spray consisting of normal saline
4877,significant differences were found in the pain scores at and minutes between the groups p
4878,also significant differences were found in the mean pain scores in the first and first minutes after treatment between the groups p
4879,of the patients in group had no pain relief and required pethidine
4880,however this rate in group was
4881,in cases we prescribed pethidine within minutes after treatment and these patients were excluded from our study
4882,according to our results intranasal desmopressin plus diclofenac sodium suppository caused prompt pain relief with significant decreases in pain scores after and minutes
4883,we suggest that intranasal desmopressin spray is a useful supplemental therapy for renal colic in combination with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs especially to reduce the use of opioids
4884,emulsification internal gelation has been suggested as an alternative to extrusion external gelation in the encapsulation of several compounds including non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium
4885,the objective of the present study was a trial to formulate diclofenac sodium as controlled release microparticles that might be administered once or twice daily
4886,this could be achieved via emulsification internal gelation technique applying box behnken design to choose these formulae
4887,box behnken design determined fifteen formulae containing specified amounts of the independent variables which included stirring speed in rpm x drug polymer ratio x and the surfactant span x
4888,the dependent variables studied were cumulative percent release after two hours y four hours y and eight hours y
4889,the prepared microparticles were characterized for their production yield sizes shapes and morphology entrapment efficiency and diclofenac sodium in vitro release as well
4890,the results showed that the production yield of the prepared diclofenac sodium microparticles was found to be between and
4891,the formulated microparticles exhibited acceptable drug content values that lie in the range
4892,also the data obtained revealed that increasing the mixing speed x generally resulted in decreased microparticle size
4893,in addition scanning electron microscope images of the microparticles illustrated that the formula contains lower span concentration in combination with lower stirring speed rpm which showed wrinkled but smooth surfaces
4894,however by increasing surfactant concentration microspheres surfaces become smoother and slightly porous
4895,kinetic treatment of the in vitro release from drug loaded microparticles indicated that the zero order is the drug release mechanism for the most formulae
4896,diclofenac sodium is widely used in the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug in the treatment of pain and inflammation

4902,a novel granular carbon nanotubes cnts alumina alo hybrid adsorbent with good sorption and regeneration properties was successfully prepared by mixing cnts with surfactant brij and pseudo boehmite followed by calcining to remove surfactant and form porous granules
4903,alumina binder increased the mechanical strength hydrophilicity and porosity of the granular adsorbent while the dispersed cnts in the granular adsorbent were responsible for the sorption of diclofenac sodium ds and carbamazepine cbz
4904,scanning electron microscopy sem showed that the cnts and alo were mixed well and the porous structure was formed in the granular adsorbent
4905,the high surface area and appropriate pore size of granular cnts alo adsorbent were favorable for sorption
4906,the sorption of ds decreased with increasing solution ph while ph had little effect on cbz sorption
4907,the maximum sorption capacities of cbz and ds on the cnts alo adsorbent were and mol g according to the langmuir fitting
4908,moreover the spent cnts alo adsorbent can be thermally regenerated at c in air due to the thermal stability of cnts
4909,the removal of cbz and ds changed a little in the initial reuse cycles and then kept relatively constant until tenth cycles
4910,the adsorbed cbz and ds were decomposed in the regeneration process
4911,this regenerable adsorbent may find potential application in water or wastewater treatment for the removal of some micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals
4912,a tentative study on interaction of diclofenac sodium df na with human serum albumin hsa and calf thymus dna ctdna was conducted by using multi spectroscopic and molecular modeling techniques under simulative physiological conditions
4913,the results of spectroscopic measurements suggested that the quenching mechanisms were static quenching
4914,three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy clearly demonstrated the occurrence of conformational changes of hsa with addition of df na
4915,in addition competitive studies with ethidium bromide eb have shown that df na can bind to ctdna relatively strong via groove binding
4916,based on the values of thermodynamic parameters and the results of molecular modeling it was confirmed that hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bond were the mainly binding forces in df na hsa and df na dna systems
4917,the binding distance between df na and hsa was also determined using the theory of the f rster energy transference

4925,this post hoc analysis examined the frequency and type of aes in patients who received dsg concomitantly with drugs known to have potential interactions with diclofenac
4926,this was a post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial of dsg for knee oa pain
4927,patients n aged years with oa in one or both knees but with clinical oa symptoms in only one knee administered dsg topically to the target knee four times daily total dose g d for weeks
4928,drugs with the potential for major or moderate drug drug interactions ddis were identified via drugs com
4929,ae rates were compared in patients with versus those without potential ddi
4930,at least one ae was experienced by of patients with ddi and by of patients with no ddis
4931,gastrointestinal aes upper and lower were reported in and cardiovascular aes in and renal aes in and and hepatic aes in and of patients with ddi compared with patients with no ddis respectively
4932,concurrent use of dsg with medications that had potential for major to moderate ddis had little impact on the frequency of aes in this population
4933,further research is needed to consider how factors such as dose duration and timing of concomitant drug administration may affect the likelihood of clinically evident aes resulting from a potential ddi
4934,diclofenac sodium ds is used primarily to treat fever and to alleviate pain and inflammation
4935,we investigated the effects of ds exposure during gestation on the testes of rat pups to investigate the safety of its use during the prenatal period
4936,pregnant rats were separated into control saline low dose medium dose and high dose groups
4937,ds was given between weeks and of gestation

4940,no significant differences were found in the total number of spermatogonia in the control saline and low dose ds groups
4941,medium and high dose ds administration reduced the total number of spermatogonia compared to other groups
4942,we suggest that prenatal administration of ds can cause deleterious effects on the testis development especially in high doses
4943,the results of experimental studies with animals indicated that prostaglandins stimulate bone resorption that skeletal production of prostaglandin e is enhanced by ovariectomy and is diminished by beta estradiol and that the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid naproxyn prevents bone loss after ovariectomy
4944,studies were carried out to investigate the effects of the nsaid diclofenac sodium on bone and mineral metabolism in premenopausal women and to compare the effects of diclofenac sodium and conjugated estrogens on bone and mineral metabolism in postmenopausal women
4945,ten healthy premenopausal women and healthy postmenopausal women were studied while not being treated and again after weeks of treatment with diclofenac sodium mg per day in divided doses both groups and conjugated estrogens mg per day postmenopausal women
4946,cross linked n telopeptides of type i collagen were measured in the urine as an index of bone resorption
4947,the postmenopausal women were separated into two groups responders and nonresponders based on their response to conjugated estrogens as assessed by linear discriminant analysis for groups
4948,conjugated estrogens lowered urinary n telopeptides of type i collagen in responders but not in nonresponders
4949,urinary cross linked n telopeptides were higher in the eight postmenopausal women responders than in the nine postmenopausal nonresponders or in the premenopausal women and were not altered by diclofenac sodium in premenopausal women
4950,in the eight postmenopausal women with higher rates of bone resorption diclofenac sodium and conjugated estrogens significantly lowered both urinary calcium concentration and urinary cross linked n telopeptides
4951,the effects of the two drugs were comparable
4952,the preliminary results demonstrate that at the dose used diclofenac sodium is almost as effective as conjugated estrogens for decreasing bone loss in postmenopausal women
4953,further studies will be needed to determine whether diclofenac sodium can prevent postmenopausal bone loss

5022,to compare the efficacy of two topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen commonly used prior to cataract surgery to inhibit surgically induced miosis
5023,department of ophthalmology cornell university medical college the new york hospital new york new york
5024,fifty one patients having phacoemulsification were randomly assigned to receive topical treatment with either diclofenac sodium or flurbiprofen every minutes for four doses along with their dilating drops beginning hour before surgery
5025,all surgeries were videotaped with the magnification calibrated
5026,the videotapes were analyzed and the horizontal and vertical diameters of the pupil were measured just before the initial conjunctival incision baseline and then every minutes during the procedure
5027,measurements were also made at the beginning of capsulorhexis the beginning of phacoemulsification the end of phacoemulsification the end of cortical cleanup and before and after implantation of an intraocular lens
5028,there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups in baseline pupil dilation however regardless of the drug received the light irides were on average more dilated at baseline than the dark ones
5029,after surgery began there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time or surgical interval except at the start of phacoemulsification at which point the flurbiprofen treated eyes were more dilated than the diclofenac treated eyes
5030,diclofenac sodium and flurbiprofen were equally effective in maintaining intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery
5031,the present manuscript describes a label free electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of sodium diclofenac dcf
5032,in order to construct the biosensor the amino functionalized diclofenac binding aptamer dba was covalently immobilized on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode gce
5033,the conformation of the dbas on the surface of the electrode is changed when this is exposed to different concentrations of dcf
5034,the introduction of dcf induces an alteration in the conformation of the surface immobilized dba and causes a decrease in the charge transfer resistance of the aptasensor
5035,however the charge transfer resistance is increased by incubation of gce dba dcf in the secondary dba
5036,the changes in the charge transfer resistance have been monitored using the voltammetric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic eis techniques
5037,the aptasensor shows two different linear dynamic ranges over m and m to mm and the sensitivity of k m and detection limit of m were obtained
5038,the validity of the method and applicability of the aptasensor were successfully evaluated by detection of dcf in a blood serum sample without interference from the sample matrix
5039,furthermore the aptasensor has shown good stability
5040,many pharmaceutical agents require formulation in order to facilitate their efficacious delivery
5041,however the interaction between the active species and the formulation additives has the potential to significantly influence the pharmocokinetics of the active
5042,in this study the solution interactions between hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc with two non steroidal anti inflammatories the sodium salts of diclofenac and meclofenamate were investigated using tensiometric rheological nmr neutron scattering and turbidimetric techniques
5043,the two drugs behaved very differently meclofenamate addition to hpmc solutions led to substantial increases in viscosity a depression of the gel point and a marked reduction in the self diffusion coefficient of the drug whereas diclofenac did not induce these changes
5044,collectively these observations are evidence of meclofenamate forming self assembled aggregates on the hpmc a phenomenon not observed with diclofenac na
5045,any process that leads to aggregation on a nonionic polymer will not be strongly favoured when the aggregating species is charged
5046,thus it is hypothesised that the distinction between the two drugs arises as a consequence of the tautomerism present in meclofenamate that builds electron density on the carbonyl group that is further stabilised by hydrogen bonding to the hpmc
5047,this mechanism is absent in the diclofenac case and thus no interaction is observed
5048,these studies propose for the first time a molecular basis for the observed often unexpected concentration dependant changes in hpmc solution properties when co formulated with different nsaids and underline the importance of characterising such fundamental interactions that have the potential to influence drug release in solid hpmc based dosage forms
5049,this work was conducted to optimize and evaluate pluronic f based thermoresponsive diclofenac sodium ophthalmic in situ gels ds in situ gel
5050,they were prepared by cold method and investigated their physicochemical properties i e ph flow ability sol gel transition temperature gelling capacity and rheological properties
5051,an optimized formulation was selected and investigated its physicochemical properties before and after autoclaving eye irritation potency in sirc cells and rabbits
5052,in vivo ophthalmic absorption was performed in rabbits
5053,it was found that physicochemical properties of ds in situ gels were affected by formulation compositions
5054,increment of pluronic f content decreased sol gel transition temperature of the products while increase in pluronic f concentration tended to increase sol gel transition temperature
5055,in this study carbopol did not affect sol gel transition temperature but it affected transparency ph and gelling capacity of the products
5056,the optimized formulation exhibited sol gel transition at c with pseudoplastic flow behavior
5057,it was lost diclofenac sodium content during autoclaving
5058,however it was accepted as safe for ophthalmic use and could increase diclofenac sodium bioavailability in aqueous humor significantly
5059,in conclusion the optimized ds in situ gel had potential for using as an alternative to the conventional diclofenac sodium eye drop
5060,however autoclaving was not a suitable sterilization method for this product
5061,sustained release polymeric particles containing diclofenac sodium dispersed in gelucire matrix and encapsulated in calcium alginate shell were prepared with different drug to polymer ratios and also with different concentrations of sodium alginate for a fixed drug to polymer ratio in an aqueous environment
5062,spherical particles were formed by dropping an emulsion of diclofenac sodium in gelucire matrix emulsified with sodium alginate into calcium chloride solution
5063,the gelled beads formed by ionotropic gelation of alginate with calcium ions showed sustained release of the water soluble drug in in vitro release study
5064,drug release was a function of square root of time suggesting a matrix diffusion release pattern
5065,the rate of release was significantly suppressed with increasing proportions of gelucire in the mixture
5066,sustained and complete release was achieved with gelucire of low melting point and low hlb value
5067,no significant drug release occurred in a dissolution medium of ph whereas complete release was observed at ph consistent with considerable swelling of the alginate gel at this ph
5068,terpenes and sesquiterpenes have been suggested as promising non toxic non irritating transdermal penetration enhancers
5069,this investigation aimed to study the effect of terpene concentration on the transdermal absorption of diclofenac sodium from ethanol glycerin phosphate buffer solution
5070,therefore enhancing effects of various terpenes menthone limonenoxide carvone nerolidol and farnsol with different concentrations and v v on the permeation of diclofenac sodium were evaluated using franz diffusion cells fitted with rat skin
5071,furthermore solubility of diclofenac sodium in the vehicle in presence of different concentrations of terpenes was determined
5072,the results showed that despite the negligible effect of terpenes on the drug solubility there was a profound skin penetration enhancement effect although the terpene enhancers varied in their ability to enhance the flux of diclofenac sodium
5073,the results showed that at the highest concentration of terpene v v the rank order of enhancement effect for diclofenac sodium was nerolidol farnesol carvone methone limonenoxide whereas at the low concentration of the rank order was farnesol carvone nerolidol menthone limonenoxide
5074,no direct relationship existed between terpene concentration and the permeation rate
5075,the most outstanding penetration enhancer was nerolidol providing an almost fold increase in permeability coefficient of diclofenac sodium followed by farnesol with a fold increase
5076,understanding physical chemistry underlying drug protein interactions is essential to devise guidelines for the synthesis of target oriented drugs
5077,binding of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium dcf and an antibiotic drug cefotaxime sodium cft belonging to the family of cephalosporins with bovine serum albumin bsa has been examined using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry itc differential scanning calorimetry dsc steady state and time resolved fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies
5078,binding affinity of both dcf and cft with bsa is observed to be of the order of m with the binding profiles fitting well to the single set of binding site model
5079,the disagreement between calorimetric and van t hoff enthalpies indicates non adherence to a two state binding process which could be attributed to changes in the conformation of the protein upon ligand binding as well as with increase in the temperature
5080,circular dichroism and the fluorescence results however do not show any major conformational changes upon binding of these drugs to bsa and hence the discrepancy could be due to temperature induced conformational changes in the protein
5081,the results of ionic strength dependence and binding in the presence of anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants indicate involvement of more that a single type of interaction in the binding process
5082,the itc results for the binding of these drugs to bsa in presence of each other indicate that the binding sites for the two drugs are different and therefore binding of one is not influenced by the other
5083,the dsc results provide quantitative information on the effect of these drugs on the stability of serum albumin
5084,the combined calorimetric and spectroscopic approach has provided a detailed analysis including thermodynamics of the binding of dcf and cft with bsa qualitatively and quantitatively
5085,neural tube defects are congenital malformations of the central nervous system
5086,genetic predisposition and some environmental factors play an important role in the development of neural tube defects
5087,this study aimed to investigate the effects of diclofenac sodium on the neural tube development in a chick embryo model that corresponds to the first month of vertebral deve lopment in mammals
5088,seventy five fertile specific pathogen free eggs were incubated for h and were divided into five groups of eggs each
5089,diclofenac sodium was administered via the sub blastodermic route at this stage
5090,incubation was continued till the end of the th h all eggs were then opened and embryos were dissected from embryonic membranes and evaluated morphologically and histopathologically
5091,it was determined that the use of increasing doses of diclofenac sodium led to defects of midline closure in early chicken embryos
5092,there were statistically significant differences in neural tube positions open or close among the groups
5093,in addition crown rump length somite number were significantly decreased in high dose experimental groups compared with control group
5094,this study showed that development of neurons is affected in chi cken embryos after administration of diclofenac sodium
5095,the exact teratogenic mechanism of diclofenac sodium is not clear therefore it should be investigated
5096,nicolau syndrome also known as livedo like dermatitis or embolia cutis medicamentosa is a rare complication following the intramuscular or intra articular injection of various drugs
5097,in our case report we report the case of a year old turkish woman who developed nicolau syndrome after an intramuscular injection in her right gluteal region of single dose diclofenac sodium to treat a headache
5098,a culture taken from the ulcer showed growth of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus on the th day
5099,the secondary staphylococcal infection was treated effectively with intravascular ampicillin sulbactam g day
5100,she was treated with surgical debridement sterile dressings and analgesics
5101,the ulcer healed completely within weeks with scarring
5102,although nicolau syndrome develops very rarely it is an important cause for morbidity
5103,it is an iatrogenic condition treated mostly by health care workers
5104,thus although it appears to be a very simple procedure for a health care worker care must be taken during intramuscular injections
5105,although diclofenac sodium is a widely used non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nicolau syndrome following intramuscular diclofenac sodium injection has rarely been reported in the published literature
5106,the application of a cold compress was considered to be an aggravating factor in our patient
5107,this case highlights the need for awareness about this condition and the need to exercise utmost care during the administration of any parenteral injections by health workers
5108,the effectiveness of an anaesthetic technique employing diclofenac sodium as an analgesic given preoperatively by intramuscular injection was compared against one employing intravenous fentanyl in patients undergoing laparoscopic sterilization
5109,postoperative pain was marked and both drugs provided partial relief only
5110,patients in the diclofenac group had pain scores that were initially higher than those in the fentanyl group and the difference between the groups was statistically significant p
5111,patients in the diclofenac group who received postoperative supplemental morphine analgesia recorded lower pain scores at min than comparable patients in the fentanyl group p
5112,these findings suggest that neither drug provides sufficient analgesia for laparoscopic sterilization when given as a sole analgesic
5113,investigation of a combined analgesic technique employing morphine and a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug is warranted
5114,the aim of the study was to determine the pharmaceutical availability of various ointment systems containing antirheumatic substances and to establish an optimal system for cutaneous application
5115,topical application permits elimination or at least reduction of side effects connected with oral administration
5116,three systems were evaluated emulsion w o ointment emulsion o w cream and gel all of them containing diclofenac sodium or indomethacin
5117,the investigated systems are characterized by proper rheological parameters and long physicochemical stability
5118,studies on diclofenac and indomethacin pharmaceutical availability show a good release of the substances from cream and hydrogel bases but a very poor release from the ointment base
5119,a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac acts efficiently against inflammation however down regulation of diclofenac on bone remodeling has raised concerns
5120,the inhibitory mechanisms of diclofenac are poorly understood
5121,we hypothesized that diclofenac down regulates osteoclast differentiation and activation via inhibition of the translocation of phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa b nfkappab
5122,when osteoclasts prepared from mouse hematopoietic stem cells were treated with diclofenac tartrateresistant acid phosphatase positive multinucleated cells decreased in a concentration dependent manner
5123,pit formation assay revealed the abolition of osteoclastic bone resorption levels of cathepsin k transcripts an osteoclastic resorption marker were down regulated time dependently
5124,diclofenac induced the accumulation of the inhibitor of kappa b in cytosol which led to suppression of the nuclear translocation of nfkappab and phosphorylated nfkappab
5125,these results suggest that the novel mechanism of diclofenac for bone remodeling is associated with phosphorylated nfkappab reduction which regulates osteoclast differentiation and activation
5126,diclofenac is a potent anti inflammatory and analgesic compound with good antipyretic and uricosuric properties
5127,it is one of the most potent inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase known
5128,it shows a favourable therapeutic ratio considering its efficacy and proved superior to the reference drugs in terms of gastro intestinal tolerability
5129,all metabolites are clearly less potent than the parent compound
5130,this study was aimed to develop a stable enteric coated diclofenac sodium tablets using sureteic without a subcoating layer
5131,diclofenac uncoated tablets were developed and manufactured through the non direct compression process
5132,sureteric white aqueous coating dispersion was used as enteric coating material
5133,sureteric is a special mixture of polyvinyl acetate phthalate phthalavin r pvap plasticizers and other ingredients in a suitable optimized dry powder formulation
5134,the obtained enteric coated tablets were subjected to disintegration and no sign of cracking was observed when they placed in a hydrochloric solution at ph but they were completely disintegrated within minutes when they putted in buffered solution at ph
5135,dissolution test was also conducted by placing tablets in m hcl for hours and then hour in phosphate buffer at ph less than of drug was released in the acidic phase and up to in the basic medium
5136,these results show that sureteric can be successfully used to produce diclofenac sodium enteric coated tablets in order to prevent its release in the stomach and facilitate immediate release of the drug in the duodenum
5137,these findings suggest that aqueous enteric coating with sureteric system is an easy and economical approach for preparing stable diclofenac sodium enteric coat without the use of a subcoating layer
5138,we studied the effect of a model electrolytic drug on intermolecular interactions conformational changes and phase transitions in structured discontinuous cubic ql lyotropic liquid crystals
5139,these changes were due to competition with hydration of the lipid headgroups
5140,structural changes of the phase induced by solubilization loads of sodium diclofenac na dfc were investigated by directly observing the water ethanol and na dfc components of the resulting phases using h and na nmr
5141,na dfc interacted with the surfactant glycerol monoolein gmo at the interface while interfering with the mesophase curvature and also competed with hydration of the surfactant headgroups
5142,increasing quantities of solubilized na dfc promoted phase transitions from cubic phase discontinuous ql and bicontinuous q into lamellar structures and subsequently into a disordered lamellar phase
5143,quadrupolar coupling of deuterated ethanol by h nmr showed that it is located near the headgroups of the lipid and apparently is hydrogen bonded to the gmo headgroups
5144,a phase transition between two lamellar phases l alpha to l alpha was seen by na nmr of na dfc at a concentration where the characteristics of the drug change from kosmotropic to chaotropic
5145,these findings show that loads of solubilized drug may affect the structure of its vehicle and as a result its transport across skin blood barriers
5146,the structural changes of the mesophase may also aid controlled drug delivery
5147,the study was designed to examine the binding of diclofenac sodium with bovine serum albumin bsa at different temperatures degrees degrees and degrees c ph and and ionic strengths micro and by means of equilibrium dialysis method
5148,the concentration of diclofenac sodium was maintained at wider range from to micromole l and bsa concentration was maintained at micromole l
5149,the data obtained were interpreted by nonlinear regression method using graphpad prism software
5150,the analysis showed that the interaction between diclofenac sodium with bsa results in two site saturable binding
5151,a decrease in association constant was observed with increasing temperature
5152,the average standard free energy change deltagdegrees value was site i and site ii kcal mol
5153,the standard enthalpy change deltahdegrees and the standard entropy change deltasdegrees were kcal mole cal mole site i and kcal mole cal mole site ii respectively
5154,the negative enthalpy change suggested the binding between diclofenac sodium and the binding sites of bsa were spontaneous and exothermic
5155,the negative value of deltahdegrees and deltasdegrees indicated hydrogen bonding and van der waal s force was the major mechanism for diclofenac sodium and bsa interaction
5156,increase in ph and ionic strength also caused decrease in association constant of diclofenac sodium and bsa binding
5157,the ft raman quantification of diclofenac sodium and aminophylline commercial injection solutions was performed
5158,the efficiency of various spectra treatment procedures including classical univariate intensity ratio and multivariate partial least squares pls and principal component regression pcr methods was compared
5159,first the calibration models were built using unnormalised spectra
5160,next spectra normalised by the intensity of a selected band of ch cn added as an internal standard to the studied samples were utilised
5161,to compare the predictive ability of the models constructed the relative standard error of prediction rsep was calculated
5162,the errors found for multivariate calibrations were a few times smaller than those for the univariate ones
5163,usually the most effective was the pls method for which rsep values of the order of for calibration and for testing data sets were obtained
5164,four commercial preparations of diclofenac sodium and one of aminophylline containing by weight of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api were quantified applying the developed models
5165,concentrations found from the raman data analysis correlate with the declared values and the results of reference analyses
5166,for the studied diclofenac sodium solutions they amount to of the former and of the latter quantities for the pls models optimised for each medicine based on unnormalised spectra
5167,these values for the aminophylline preparation were found to be and respectively
5168,it shows that the proposed procedure based on the chemometric treatment of ft raman spectra can be a fast and convenient alternative to the standard pharmacopoeial procedures of api quantification even in relatively diluted injection solutions
5169,evidence has been presented that inhibition by diclofenac sodium of the production of leukotrienes by cells participating in the inflammatory process is due to a decreased availability of intracellular arachidonic acid which results from enhanced uptake of the substrate into triglyceride pools
5170,the diminished leukotriene production does not result from direct inhibition of lipoxygenase or phospholipase a
5171,reduced availability of arachidonic acid would also limit production of prostaglandins although in this case manifestation is obscured by the potent inhibitory effect of diclofenac sodium on cyclooxygenase
5172,this recently discovered action of diclofenac sodium which has been characterized by studies on isolated leukocytes appears to be operative in vivo
5173,consistent with this mechanism and not explainable by classical cyclooxygenase inhibition diclofenac sodium inhibited leukotriene production in whole blood from drug treated animals and also suppressed leukocyte infiltration of subcutaneously implanted sponges
5174,the latter effect contrasts with increased infiltration frequently obtained with other nsaids and thought to reflect enhanced production of leukotrienes
5175,in conclusion the findings suggest that patient acceptance or preference for diclofenac sodium is not merely subjective but has a logical scientific basis
5176,therapeutic effect of sodium diclofenac during fever reaction is associated not only with specific modulation of thermoregulation but also with the increase in the count of lymphocytes transported with the lymph into systemic circulation stimulation of lymph microcirculation and improvement of metabolism in the interstitial space
5177,this preparation inhibited kininogenesis and stimulated degradation of kinins
5178,sodium diclofenac serves as a universal inhibitor of the kallikrein kinin system
5179,a singel mg enteric coated tablet of diclofenac sodium voltaren was administered to two groups each consisting of eight female subjects
5180,the subjects in the one group were young adults all aged less than years while those in the other were all over the age of years
5181,the plasma concentration time profiles relative bio availability and urinary excretion pattern of the drug in the two groups were similar
5182,thus in the absence of interacting factors such as drugs and disease the ability to absorb metabolise and excrete diclofenac sodium does not appear to be influenced by age
5183,the formation of two oxidative degradates of diclofenac in solution and the solid state was demonstrated
5184,the objectives of the work included presentation of magnetic resonance imaging mri and fractal analysis based approach to comparison of dosage forms of different composition structure and assessment of the influence of the compositional factors i e matrix type excipients etc on properties and performance of the dosage form during drug dissolution
5185,the work presents the first attempt to compare mri data obtained for tablet formulations of different composition and characterized by distinct differences in hydration and drug dissolution mechanisms
5186,the main difficulty in such a case stems from differences in hydration behavior and tablet s geometry i e swelling cracking capping etc
5187,a novel approach to characterization of matrix systems i e quantification of changes of geometrical complexity of the matrix shape during drug dissolution has been developed
5188,using three chosen commercial modified release tablet formulations with diclofenac sodium we present the method of parameterization of their geometrical complexity on the base of fractal analysis
5189,the main result of the study is the correlation between the hydrating tablet behavior and drug dissolution the increase of geometrical complexity expressed as fractal dimension relates to the increased variability of drug dissolution results
5190,the combined effect of cyclic monoterpenes and ethanol on the percutaneous absorption of diclofenac sodium dfs from gel ointments was investigated in vivo in rats
5191,the enhancing activity of terpenes was significantly affected by the concentration of ethanol formulated in the gel ointments
5192,at a lower concentration of ethanol cineole was observed to be the most effective
5193,on the other hand d limonene showed strong activity when the large amount of ethanol was formulated
5194,a synergistic effect between terpenes and ethanol on the percutaneous absorption of dfs was significantly observed in cases of cineole and l menthol using an analysis of variance anova
5195,when the diclofenac df free form was formulated in gel ointment the percutaneous absorption was significantly reduced
5196,the reduction of the percutaneous absorption was closely related to the decrease in ph of the gel ointment owing to the free form of df which was formulated
5197,the effect of sodium diclofenac on serum and tissue amoxicillin concentration as well as their effect against staphylococcal infection was observed
5198,four polyurethane sponges were placed in the back of thirty rats
5199,after d two granulomatous tissues received ml of cfu ml staphylococcus aureus
5200,two days later the rats were divided into five groups group received amoxicillin mg kg p o group received amoxicillin mg kg p o group received sodium diclofenac mg kg i m
5201,and amoxicillin mg kg p o group received sodium diclofenac mg kg i m and group control group received nacl ml p o
5202,after six hours of drug administration blood serum microl and noninfected granulomatous tissues were placed on mueller hinton agar inoculated with cfu ml s aureus
5203,infected tissues were dispersed in a sonic system and were spread microl on salt mannitol agar
5204,microorganisms were counted and the inhibition zones were measured after h of incubation at degrees c amoxicillin tissue concentration was microg g for group microg g for group and microg g for group the serum concentrations were microg ml for group microg ml for group and microg ml for group no differences were observed among group and regarding staphylococci counts kruskall wallis test p
5205,group reduced p staphylococci counts comparing to group it was concluded that sodium diclofenac reduced serum and tissue amoxicillin concentration and even in large doses amoxicillin was not effective in eradicating the staphylococcal infection after h of administration
5206,literature data are reviewed regarding the scientific advisability of allowing a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence be testing for the approval of immediate release ir solid oral dosage forms containing either diclofenac potassium and diclofenac sodium
5207,within the biopharmaceutics classification system bcs diclofenac potassium and diclofenac sodium are each bcs class ii active pharmaceutical ingredients apis
5208,however a biowaiver can be recommended for ir drug products of each salt form due to their therapeutic use therapeutic index pharmacokinetic properties potential for excipient interactions and performance in reported be bioavailability ba studies provided a test and comparator contain the same diclofenac salt b the dosage form of the test and comparator is identical c the test product contains only excipients present in diclofenac drug products approved in ich or associated countries in the same dosage form for instance as presented in this paper d test drug product and comparator dissolve in min or less in ml buffer ph using the paddle apparatus at rpm or the basket apparatus at rpm and e test product and comparator show dissolution profile similarity in ph and
5209,a phamacokinetic study in man has been made of a new dosage form of diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine diep soluble salt packed in sachets was compared with diclofenac sodium as enteric coated tablets
5210,oral diep x mg showed a significant difference in absorption kinetics ka lag time and tmax as compared to oral diclofenac sodium x mg a relevant plasma concentration of diclofenac was detected just min after diep while diclofenac sodium produced a measurable plasma concentration only h after the treatment
5211,cmax and t after diep and diclofenac sodium were comparable
5212,comparison of the two auc values showed that diep was bioequivalent to diclofenac sodium q
5213,diclofenac sodium is one of the potent non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions
5214,the present work deals with the estimation of diclofenac sodium from serum by a novel high performance thin layer chromatographic hptlc method developed in our laboratory
5215,standard diclofenac sodium was spotted on silica gel f precoated plates which were developed using the mobile phase toluene acetone glacial acetic acid v v v
5216,densitometric analysis of diclofenac sodium was carried out at nm with diclofenac being detected at an r f of the method was subsequently developed to estimate diclofenac sodium from serum
5217,diclofenac sodium was extracted with ethyl acetate from serum samples spotted on silica gel f plates and the plates were developed using the above mentioned mobile phase
5218,the method was validated for selectivity extraction efficiency sensitivity accuracy and intra and inter day reproducibility studies
5219,the extraction efficiency was found to range from to
5220,the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of diclofenac sodium in serum were found to be and ng respectively
5221,the calibration curve of diclofenac sodium in serum was found to be linear in the range of ng
5222,the mean values s d
5223,of correlation coefficient slope and intercept were found to be and respectively
5224,the mean percentage coefficient of variation for accuracy intra day and inter day analysis at ng of diclofenac sodium were found to be and respectively
5225,the proposed method is a simple and sensitive method with good precision and reproducibility for the estimation of diclofenac sodium form serum samples
5226,in a single blind random study simultaneously carried out by five pain therapy and palliative care centres the analgesic power and side effects of sodium naproxen cas and sodium diclofenac cas by mouth were compared in a group of advanced cancer patients
5227,the patients complained of somatic and or visceral pain and were treated with non steroid anti inflammatories as required
5228,the dose administered amounted to mg every h for sodium naproxen and to mg every h for sodium diclofenac
5229,the study stressed the similar analgesic effect of the two drugs pain intensity and duration decreased by half in the first week of treatment and a comparatively low morbidity rate
5230,diclofenac sodium is one of the most prescribed nsaids in the world which is frequently used in therapy of musculosceletal diseases
5231,therefore it is important to justify clinical and literary data about diclofenac hepatotoxicity
5232,we searched for diclofenac versus placebo investigations performed in patients with osteoarthrosis
5233,a method of the search included international databases such as embase cochrane database databases of medical publishers and search engines
5234,total amount of patients in all trials was
5235,patients took diclofenac and ones took placebo
5236,meta analysis was performed in statsdirect software
5237,we estimated confidence interval q and criteria mantel haenszel and dersimonian laird statistics and relative risk of adverse reactions
5238,relative risk of hepatitis in diclofenac group did not differ from placebo
5239,hereby the fact of diclofenac hepatotoxicity needs more detailed study and genetic factors of risk should be taken into account
5240,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sodium diclofenac on the bioavailability of amoxicillin
5241,in this randomised crossover study with a week washout period volunteers received a g oral dose of amoxicillin amoxil group or a g oral dose of amoxicillin with mg of sodium diclofenac voltaren group
5242,blood samples were collected at and h following drug administration
5243,high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection was used to quantify plasma amoxicillin concentrations
5244,bioassay micrococcus luteus atcc was performed to verify the antimicrobial efficacy of amoxicillin in vitro
5245,the pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma concentration time curve auc maximum plasma concentration observed during the h study period c max and renal clearance cl were analysed by analysis of variance and time at which c max occurred t max and volume of distribution vd were analysed by wilcoxon test p
5246,for group the mean standard deviation auc c max and t max values were microg min ml microg ml and min respectively and for group the values were microg min ml microg ml and min respectively
5247,lower values of auc and c max were observed for group p
5248,cl of amoxicillin increased p by in group suggesting that sodium diclofenac may interfere with amoxicillin renal excretion
5249,in conclusion sodium diclofenac can significantly reduce the bioavailability of amoxicillin
5250,a sensitive simple and novel method was developed to determine diclofenac sodium ds using silver nanoparticles agnps as probe by resonance light scattering rls technique
5251,it was found that ds could quench the rls intensity of agnps
5252,moreover the decrease in rls intensity was linearly correlated to the concentration of ds over the range of gml
5253,the vasopressin analogue desamino arginine vasopressin desmopressin is a potent antidiuretic without the pressor effects of vasopressin
5254,a total of patients with acute renal colic due to stone disease received microgramsfpmopressin intranasal spray with encouraging results
5255,there was a significant decrease in the colic pain intensity from an initial mean visual analogue score of mm
5258,eight patients had complete pain relief within minutes of administering intranasal desmopressin spray
5259,nine of patients who required intramuscular diclofenac sodium achieved complete pain relief within another minutes
5260,in other words when intranasal desmopressin spray was administered before diclofenac sodium of the patients achieved complete pain relief and were discharged home
5261,the mechanism of analgesic action of desmopressin in renal colic is uncertain
5262,at the peripheral level desmopressin may alleviate the acute renal colic through its potent antidiuretic effect or by relaxing the renal pelvic and ureteral smooth muscles
5263,the central analgesic effect of desmopressin by stimulating the release of the hypothalamic beta endorphin is proposed
5264,we conclude that intranasal desmopressin spray can be used successfully in the treatment of renal colic
5265,it may also replace prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors in treating renal colic with the advantage of avoiding the potential side effects
5266,further studies are needed to investigate whether the combination of desmopressin with analgesics or spasmolytic drugs offers competitive results compared with those achieved by prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors in the treatment of renal colic
5267,the influence of glycyrrhizin extracted from glycyrrhiza glabra var
5268,glandulifera licorice roots on the percutaneous absorption of diclofenac sodium from sodium carboxymethylcellulose nacmc gels or oil in water o w emulsion was investigated
5269,skin permeation experiments were carried out using excised abdominal rat skin
5270,the results showed that the efficiency of glycyrrhizin as an enhancer agent is greater in gel formulations than it is in the emulsions
5271,the enhancer with the concentration of w w in gel increased diclofenac sodium flux value to tenfold compared with the control gel
5272,this study presents development and evaluation of novel sustained release system of diclofenac sodium ds prepared by solid dispersion sd technique using eudragit e ee and or eudragit s es as carriers
5273,compatibility of the drug and its crystalline nature in the sd were examined using fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd and differential scanning calorimetry dsc
5274,the drug was relatively stable amorphous in the sd
5275,the greater amount of ee or es in the sd slowed down the release rates with smaller dissolution efficiency and hence the mean dissolution time was enhanced
5276,moreover combined carriers of ee es exhibited more dissolution retarding effect than any of the carriers
5277,the release of drug followed anomalous transport in artificial intestinal juice ph
5278,the aim of this study was to compare the postoperative analgesic affects of preoperative use of a synthetic opioid tramadol and a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium for postoperative pain with placebo in patients undergoing bimaxillary osteotomy
5279,thirty six orthognathic surgery patients who underwent both le fort i osteotomy in the maxilla and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy in the mandible as bimaxillary osteotomy were randomly allocated into groups via sealed envelope technique
5280,group t n group d n and group p n received preoperative mg tramadol intramuscularly mg diclofenac sodium intramuscularly and saline respectively
5281,postoperative pain intensity visual analog scale verbal pain score postoperative opioid consumption with intravenous patient controlled analgesia hemodynamic variables and postoperative complications were compared among the groups
5282,the median number of patient controlled analgesia demands n in group p was higher than other groups group d group t p
5283,total tramadol consumption was higher in group p mg compared with group d mg p and group t mg p
5284,the groups were comparable for the area under the hemodynamic variables time curves
5285,the area under the visual analog scale and verbal pain score curves were lower in group d and group t compared with group p however there was no significant difference between group t and group d
5286,preoperative diclofenac or tramadol compared with placebo effectively decreases postoperative opioid consumption via intravenous patient controlled analgesia
5287,a modified coacervation method for preparing diclofenac sodium loaded chitosan dfs c microspheres using sodium citrate as cross linking agent was optimized
5288,a full factorial design was used to evaluate the effect of chitosan cs concentration cross linking agent concentration and cross linking time on the properties of the prepared microspheres
5289,the modified coacervation method resulted in higher yield of spherical microspheres even with a lower concentration of cs w v
5290,the morphology of the microspheres was found to be dependent on the formulation and process parameters
5291,the cross linking agent concentration had the largest impact on swelling mucoadhesion and drug release
5292,kinetic analysis of the release data revealed a quasi fickian diffusion mechanism
5293,a liquid chromatographic method has been developed for determination of drug and related compounds in diclofenac sodium raw material slow release and enteric coated tablets
5294,the method specifies a microns octadecylsilane bonded phase column a mobile phase of tetrahydrofuran acetonitrile buffer ph and detection at nm
5295,the method resolves known related compounds with limits of quantitation of or less
5296,seventeen drug raw material samples were evaluated
5297,total impurity levels ranged from to
5298,the method has also been used for determination of drug content in raw materials and formulations
5299,mean assay levels in drug raw materials ranged between and
5300,pharmacokinetic data for diclofenac sodium has been well established in healthy volunteers whereas in patients with rheumatoid arthritis very little information is available in the literature
5301,a single oral dose of enteric coated diclofenac sodium was given to patients with active rheumatoid disease adopting the same procedures used for a group of healthy volunteers in whom pharmacokinetic data was already available
5302,plasma specimens were collected over a period of h following administration and concentrations of diclofenac determined by glc
5303,resulting plasma concentration curves were similar to those obtained in the healthy subjects in that areas under curves and terminal half lives were comparable
5304,however peak concentrations of diclofenac were significantly reduced in the rheumatoid patients
5305,the lower peak concentrations were correlated with the lower serum albumin levels in the patients which are associated with active rheumatoid disease
5306,diclofenac sodium famotidine and ketorolac tromethamine were determined by flow injection analysis fia with spectrophotometric detection
5307,the sample solutions micrograms ml of diclofenac sodium micrograms ml of famotidine and micrograms ml of ketorolac tromethamine in methanol were injected into a flow system containing w v of dichloro nitrophenol dcnp in methanol
5308,the colour produced due to the formation of a charge transfer complex was measured with a spectrophotometric detector set at nm
5309,a sampling rate of per hour was achieved with high reproducibility of measurements rsd below
5310,the fia method was applied to the determination of diclofenac sodium famotidine and ketorolac tromethamine in pharmaceutical formulations
5311,the antiinflammatory agent diclofenac sodium dc exhibited remarkable antibacterial effects both in vitro and in vivo
5312,fifteen different bacteria sensitive to dc as well as to a number of common antibiotics were tested for synergistic effects in vitro
5313,disc diffusion test with dc and aminoglycosides assessed by stringent computation showed clear cut synergism
5314,synergism between dc and streptomycin sm was found to be statistically significant p or when compared with their individual effects
5315,by the checkerboard assessment procedure the fractional inhibitory concentration fic index of this combination was found to be confirming synergism
5316,the mouse protective capacity of this combination was then evaluated in vivo against s typhimurium as the virulent infecting bacterium and the size of bacterial load determined from infected autopsied animals
5317,statistical analysis by student s t test suggested this drug combination is highly synergistic synergism was also noted between dc and other aminoglycosides
5318,the polarographic response characteristics of diclofenac sodium were investigated in m hac naac ph supporting electrolyte in the absence and the presence of dissolved oxygen
5319,the results demonstrate that the reduction peak at ca
5320,v is a catalytic hydrogen wave after deaeration and the reduction peak in the presence of dissolved oxygen is a so called parallel catalytic hydrogen wave
5321,based on the parallel catalytic hydrogen wave a novel method has been proposed for the determination of diclofenac sodium by single sweep polarography
5322,the calibration curve is linear in the range x x m and the detection limit is x m the proposed method is applied to the direct determination of diclofenac sodium in tablet forms and biological samples
5323,osteoarthritis oa is a chronic degenerative joint disease that is debilitating for many individuals
5324,while oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids remain a common and effective treatment approach to managing oa concerns over cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events can potentially limit their use
5325,various formulations of topical nsaids have been shown to provide effective localized treatment with minimal adverse events
5326,a patient perception study was conducted to evaluate patient preference between topical diclofenac sodium gel and that of diclofenac sodium topical solution with the penetration enhancer dimethyl sulfoxide dmso
5327,twenty four healthy volunteers were randomized and asked to administer one dose of the topical products
5328,surveys were provided and assessed immediately after application minutes after application and after the application had dried to gauge subjects overall experience with the topical preparation
5329,overall each drug s application was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported
5330,results of the patient preference survey demonstrated that topical diclofenac solution with dmso had a number of characteristics that were rated significantly better than for diclofenac sodium gel
5331,mean subjective responses to topical diclofenac solution with dmso were also more favorable for most items in the questionnaire and more subjects preferred or highly preferred topical diclofenac solution with dmso over diclofenac sodium gel
5332,the effect of the addition of cyclodextrins cd viz alpha beta hpbeta and gamma cd to the aqueous solutions of the most widely prescribed anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium ds has been fully investigated by means of spectroscopic uv vis steady state fluorescence h nmr and roesy and thermodynamic conductivity techniques
5333,the global picture of the results indicates that diclofenac sodium penetrates the cd cavity
5334,the apparent association constants for all the inclusion complexes were estimated from fluorescence data
5335,conductivity measurements of aqueous solutions of diclofenac sodium were performed both as a function of ds concentration and cd concentration at different temperatures ranging from to degrees c results suggested the existence of complex between ds and cd
5336,the thermodynamics of the system was discussed in terms of change in gibbs free energy
5337,free energy of the ds w system was found to decrease on addition of cyclodextrin which points towards the energetically favorable interactions between drug and cyclodextrin molecules in solution phase
5338,h nmr chemical shift changes and roesy spectra provide powerful means for probing cd ds interactions
5339,to evaluate clinical effectiveness of diacerein as an adjuvant to diclofenac sodium in treatment of indian patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis oa knee
5340,this is a prospective double blind placebo controlled and intention to treat study
5341,an initial washout period of week was followed by months treatment period during which patients were randomly divided to receive either capsule diacerein mg or matched placebo once daily for the first month and twice daily for the next months with diclofenac sodium mg sustained release tablet once daily given to both groups
5342,patients were observed for one more month using paracetamol as rescue therapy
5343,treatment efficacy was assessed by a visual analogue scale vas and the western ontario and mcmaster university womac osteoarthritis index patient and physician global assessment of oa daily paracetamol intake
5344,of patients screened patients formed the intent to treat population patients in each group
5345,at baseline both groups were comparable and at the third month functional index and pain intensity were better in the diacerein group vas womac as compared to the placebo group vas womac p
5346,when analyzed at the fourth month improvement persisted in the iacerein group vas womac as compared to placebo group vas womac p demonstrating the carry over effect of diacerein which was confirmed by lesser paracetamol consumption in the diacerein group as compared to the placebo group p
5347,use of diacerein and diclofenac sodium together decreases pain and improves joint function significantly more than diclofenac alone in oa knee
5348,in assessing the possible efficacy of drugs for the treatment of osteoarthritis oa it may be helpful to have a model in animals of the early development of the disease prior to the expression of secondary phenomena
5349,it is also necessary that such effects are quantifiable
5350,to this end the natural development of oa in the str ort mouse has been investigated
5351,it has been shown that very early events in the development of the disease are disturbances in the activity of chondrocytic glucose phosphate dehydrogenase the initial step in the pentose phosphate pathway and in the orientation of the proteoglycans of the matrix of the articular cartilage
5352,the study has been done by reference to the effect of diclofenac sodium which previously has been reported to retard the destruction of articular cartilage
5353,the results appear to indicate that these markers may provide quantitative measures for assessing potential therapeutic agents
5354,a sensitive spectrophotometric method was established for the determination of diclofenac sodium ds with methylene blue mb as analytical reagent
5355,it was found that ds reacts with an excess of mb in the ph range to form a chloroform extractable blue ion association complex
5356,good agreement with beer s law was found in the range of ds concentrations of mug ml with a detection limit of mug ml
5357,the method was applied for the determination of ds in various tableted forms with a good precision
5358,the aim of this study was to compare the anti inflammatory activities of ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac sodium and loteprednol etabonate suspension in an animal model of ocular inflammation
5359,an ocular inflammatory response was induced in new zealand white rabbits by the intravenous i v
5360,administration of microg kg lipopolysaccharide lps
5361,in study animals eye was treated topically with microl of study medication n animals per drug and the other eye was treated topically with a microl vehicle buffered saline
5362,in control animals n both eyes were treated with vehicle
5363,all animals were treated twice h and h before lps challenge
5364,the breakdown of the blood aqueous barrier in the anterior chamber was measured by fluorophotometry fitc dextran mg kg i v
5365,given immediately after lps challenge
5366,aqueous prostaglandin e pge levels were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa immunoassay
5367,ketorolac resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of endotoxin induced increases in fitc dextran and pge synthesis p vs vehicle
5368,diclofenac had much less of an effect on these parameters p vs ketorolac
5369,loteprednol was no more effective than vehicle at inhibiting increases in fitc dextran
5370,ketorolac has greater anti inflammatory effects than diclofenac and loteprednol
5371,diclofenac sodium was assessed as an analgesic for postoperative pain following paediatric tonsillectomy in a randomised double blind trial
5372,in a comparison made with both a pethidine and a control group diclofenac was shown to be an effective analgesic
5373,no significant difference in analgesic efficacy was demonstrated between the two drugs although patients who received diclofenac tended to be less drowsy postoperatively than those who received pethidine
5374,there were no significant differences between the two drugs in respect of time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting
5375,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid
5376,it undergoes extensive phase i and phase ii metabolism and in vitro it is a specific cypc substrate
5377,the first part of the study consisted of oral administration of mg of diclofenac sodium voveran to healthy male volunteers
5378,blood samples were collected from the antecubital vein at intervals of and hours
5379,the second part of the study was conducted after a washout period of days
5380,treatment with mg p o
5381,of diosmin venex was given daily for days
5382,on day mg of diclofenac sodium voveran was administered
5383,blood samples were obtained as mentioned earlier and pharmacokinetic parameters of diclofenac before and after pretreatment with diosmin analyzed by hplc
5384,diosmin pretreatment significantly enhanced auc c max and t with a concomitant reduction in cl f
5385,diosmin might have inhibited the microsomal cypc mediated oxidation of diclofenac sodium
5386,anti inflammatory medications are traditionally administered to the eye only postoperatively for control of inflammation
5387,because the presumed mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids is to inhibit the formation of prostaglandin mediators of inflammation the author studied the effect that pretreatment with an nsaid had on postoperative inflammation
5388,in a prospective study patients scheduled for phacoemulsification with silicone lens implantation were randomly assigned to receive either pretreatment with one drop of diclofenac sodium four times per day for the days before surgery plus one drop of diclofenac sodium every minutes for four doses beginning hour before surgery along with the dilating drops no pretreatment but one drop of diclofenac sodium every minutes for four doses beginning hour before surgery along with the dilating drops or no diclofenac sodium drops at all before surgery
5389,no anti inflammatory medications were given either during or immediately after surgery and all patients were begun on a regimen of one drop of diclofenac sodium to the operated eye four times per day after being examined on the first postoperative day
5390,postoperative inflammation was measured on the first postoperative day and at week with a laser cell and flare meter
5391,on the first postoperative day the mean flare score for group a was photons millisecond for group b photons millisecond and for group c photons millisecond
5392,the difference between groups a and c was statistically significant
5393,the differences between groups a and b and between groups b and c were not statistically significant
5394,there was no statistically significant difference for cell scores at day or for cell or flare scores at week
5395,the pretreatment with an nsaid before cataract surgery can reduce the amount of initial postoperative inflammation
5396,the effect of camellia oil on the permeation of flurbiprofen fp and diclofenac sodium dfs used as model drugs through rat and pig skin was examined
5397,two different types of camellia oil were used one of them was purified by distillation and the other was purified by filtration without heating
5398,the distilled camellia oil dco and the filtered camellia oil fco were applied to the skin as a pretreatment
5399,permeation of fp through the skins pretreated with fco and dco was enhanced while that of dfs was suppressed
5400,the effects of fco were greater than those of dco as far as enhancement and suppression were concerned
5401,the effect of fco on fp permeation could be due to oleic acid one of the major components of fco
5402,on the other hand fco and oleic acid had opposite effects on the penetration of dfs
5403,this result suggests that other active components which suppress the permeation of dfs may be present in fco
5404,since the penetration suppressing agents will be useful for skin care products studies of such agents will be important in the future
5405,forty patients took part in an observer blind multiple dose crossover study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of mg flurbiprofen mg twice a day orally and mg suppository at night with mg diclofenac sodium mg twice daily orally and mg suppository at night in the relief of night pain and morning stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis
5406,equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive one of the treatments for the first day treatment period and then the other treatment for the second day treatment period
5407,there were significant differences in favour of flurbiprofen for the reduction in night pain improvement in quality of sleep and patients assessment of overall improvement on treatment
5408,two patients withdrew from the study due to side effects experienced whilst taking diclofenac sodium during the first treatment period
5409,eight patients in all reported a total of side effects during this study
5410,six patients reported side effects whilst taking diclofenac sodium compared with three patients who reported six side effects whilst taking flurbiprofen
5411,this study confirms the good efficacy and tolerability of flurbiprofen in the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis
5412,to assess the relative bioavailability of diclofenac sodium hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd administered via the subcutaneous s c and intramuscular i m
5413,route versus voltaren i m
5414,and to evaluate the dose linearity and pharmacokinetics of the s c formulation at three dose levels
5415,safety and local tolerability were also assessed
5416,one single dose randomized three way crossover relative bioavailability study and one linearity single escalating dose randomized three way cross over pharmacokinetic study were conducted at two different clinical sites
5417,a total of healthy male and female subjects participated in both studies
5418,subjects received mg ml diclofenac sodium hp cd i m
5419,and s c and voltaren mg ml i m
5420,in study and or mg ml diclofenac sodium hp cd s c in study
5421,study demonstrated bioequivalence of the s c test formulation with voltaren i m
5422,with respect to cmax and auc
5423,bioequivalence of the test i m
5424,with voltaren i m
5425,was also demonstrated except the upper limit of the confidence interval ci for cmax which marginally exceeded the range
5426,study demonstrated that after s c administration of the test formulation both cmax and auc are linearly related to the tested diclofenac doses
5427,all tested doses were safe and locally well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported
5428,bioequivalence of diclofenac hp cd mg ml after s c and i m
5429,administration with voltaren i m
5430,was demonstrated except for the marginal deviation in cmax when comparing the i m
5431,test and voltaren
5432,linearity was also demonstrated for the three doses intended for marketing
5433,a five centre double blind crossover trial of two two week periods using diclofenac and indomethacin showed that both drug groups patients with rheumatoid arthritis responded similarly in relation to pain scores and morning stiffness
5434,it was noted that the response was better in inpatients than in outpatients despite differences in disease severity
5435,in the osteoarthritis trial patients it was shown that neither drug significantly reduced resting pain although both drugs were significantly better in reducing pain on movement however patient preference was for diclofenac
5436,three patients treated with indomethacin withdrew owing to side effects compared with one on diclofenac
5437,a slight but significant decrease in haemoglobin levels was observed in both treatment groups with osteoarthritis but this did not appear to be symptom related
5438,a new method has been devised for the determination of diclofenac sodium in bulk and in pharmaceutical preparations using eu ions as the fluorescent probe
5439,the technique was built around the hypersensitive property of the transitions of the fluorescent probe ion eu at nm
5440,this is normally a forbidden transition but the interaction with diclofenac sodium which contains a carboxylic group makes the transition allowed and enhances the intensity of its fluorescence emission
5441,the eu fluorescence emission at nm comes from a non hypersensitive transition and is not affected by ligation
5442,the intensity ratio r defined as i i was used as a measure of the percentage of bound probe ions
5443,diclofenac and eu iii forms a molar complex
5444,the relative stability constant of the complex was found to be
5445,a linear relationship between bound eu and the concentration of diclofenac sodium was found for concentrations from to micrograms ml with a recovery percentage of the method shows a good agreement with a spectrophotometric method
5446,residual diclofenac sodium ds in the environment is harmful to human health
5447,a promising method for ds removal is the use of adsorbents functionalized with amino groups that can form an ionic bond with the carboxyl group of ds at a suitable ph
5448,in this work a novel composite adsorbent composed of cellulose nanocrystals cnc and chitosan cs has been synthesized and functionalized by ethylenediamine ed in both layers
5449,characterization methods including scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectrometry and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to confirm the morphology and synthetic mechanism of the double amino functionalized adsorbent
5450,based on the optimization of adsorption conditions and modeling of the adsorption mechanism the ds adsorption process on cnc ed cs ed involves chemical adsorption and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the langmuir model is mg g
5451,cnc ed cs ed exhibits good adsorption capacity and high sustainability thus it is a promising composite material for the removal of ds from wastewater
5452,the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac were examined following single rapid intravenous injection and also following single oral doses to healthy female volunteers
5453,after intravenous injection plasma levels of diclofenac fell rapidly and were below the limits of detection at h postdosing
5454,individual drug profiles were described by a triexponential function and mean half lives of the three exponential phases were and h after oral doses of enteric coated tablets the lag time between dosing and the appearance of drug in plasma varied between and h however once drug absorption had commenced similar plasma drug profiles were obtained in different individuals
5455,peak plasma diclofenac levels ranged from to microgram
5457,the mean terminal drug half life in plasma was h after oral doses
5458,this value was not significantly greater than the value of h following intravenous doses
5459,fifty percent of orally dosed diclofenac did not reach the systemic circulation due predominantly to first pass metabolism
5460,modelling of the binding of two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs indometacin cas and diclofenac sodium cas to the molecule of human serum albumin is presented
5461,the models are based on the data obtained using difference spectroscopic technique
5462,speculations were made concerning the structural properties of the drugs and albumin molecules as well as the type of chemical interactions taking part in the drug albumin binding
5463,the proposed approach represents a more detailed investigation on the mechanism of drug protein interactions
5464,the objective of our study was to prepare and evaluate osmotic matrix om tablets of diclofenac sodium ds
5465,in vitro studies were done on uspxxiv dissolution apparatus ii in different release medium
5466,surface characteristics of coating films and osmotic contribution of om tablets also were studied
5467,in vivo evaluation was carried out in healthy human volunteers using hplc method to assay plasma samples and the results were compared with the performance of fabricated matrix and two commercial tablets of ds
5468,through in vitro drug release kinetics using regression coefficient analysis and peppas equation different pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability were determined
5469,om tablets were found to provide more prolonged and controlled therapeutic plasma ds levels and also showed improved bioavailability in comparison to fabricated matrix and commercial tablets studied
5470,to compare the efficacy of the non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs diclofenac sodium and flunixin meglumine as adjuncts to the antibiotic treatment of bovine respiratory disease brd
5471,we randomly allocated holstein calves with brd to three groups
5472,all the calves received a dose of mg kg tulathromycin by single subcutaneous injection and two of the groups received in addition either mg kg diclofenac sodium as a single intramuscular injection diclofenac group n or mg kg flunixin meglumine as an intravenous injection on the first three consecutive days after tulathromycin administration flunixin group n
5473,all calves were given a clinical score prior to initial treatment day and after treatment days and by observing appetite demeanour rectal temperature the rate and type of respiration presence or absence of coughing and nasal discharge
5474,during the first h improvement of adverse signs of respiratory disease such as pyrexia and elevated respiratory rate and of a high clinical index score was significant in the two adjunct groups compared with the calves receiving antibiotic alone
5475,the reduction in pyrexia was greatest in the diclofenac group
5476,there were no statically significant differences between treatment groups with regard to eventual perceived recovery from respiratory disease in days
5477,in this trial a single intramuscular dose of diclofenac sodium was equally effective as three intravenous injections of flunixin meglumine given on consecutive days as adjunctive therapy for brd
5478,the stability of diclofenac sodium injection was studied by means of a stability indicating high performance liquid chromatography assay method that was developed in our laboratory
5479,there was a direct relationship between the peak heights and the concentrations
5480,the percent relative standard deviation based on five injections was the products of decomposition and the excipients present in the dosage form did not interfere with the developed assay method
5481,the injection was stable for at least days when stored in clear glass vials at room temperature
5482,contrary to the recommendation in the literature the injection may not be stored at the refrigerated temperature
5483,the physcial appearacne and the ph value of the injection did not change during the study period
5484,the aim of this work is to design ph dependent swellable and erodable buffered matrices and to study the effect of the microenvironment ph on the release pattern of diclofenac sodium
5485,buffered matrix tablets containing diclofenac sodium physically mixed with hydrophilic polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc and ph dependent solubility polymer eudragit l were prepared with different microenvironment phs
5486,the release of diclofenac sodium from the buffer matrices was studied in phosphate buffer solutions of ph and the swelling and erosion matrices containing only hpmc and eudragit l were studied in phosphate buffer solution of ph similar to the microenvironment phs of the matrices
5487,drug release from matrices was found to be linear as a function of time
5488,amount of drug released was found to be higher in the medium of ph than that of ph the rate of drug release increased with the increase of the microenvironment ph of the matrices as determined from the slope
5489,the pattern of drug release did not change with the change of microenvironment ph
5490,the swelling and erosion occurred simultaneously from matrices made up of hpmc and eudragit l
5491,both extent of swelling and erosion increased with increase of the medium ph
5492,it was concluded from this study that changing the ph within the matrix influenced the rate of release of the drug without affecting the release pattern
5493,the present study examined the effect of ds exposure on median nerve development in rats during prenatal life
5494,pregnant female rats were divided into three groups a control group a saline group and a ds group
5495,offspring of these animals were divided into subgroups weeks old and weeks old
5496,nerve samples were taken from the right legs and evaluated using stereological techniques in terms of the axon number axon cross sectional area and myelin thickness
5497,no drug dependent macroscopic abnormality was observed in the nerve
5498,no differences were noted for axon number in the control saline and ds groups of the same age and gender
5499,no gender difference was found for axon number or axon area between the other matched groups
5500,in conclusion prenatal exposure to diclofenac sodium does not affect axon number in rats but can alter the morphology of the male and female median nerve
5501,based on an elementary osmotic pump controlled release systems of diclofenac sodium ds were designed to deliver the drug in a zero order release pattern
5502,osmotic pump tablets containing mg ds were prepared and coated with either semipermeable spm or microporous pm membranes
5503,the tablet coats were composed of hydrophobic triacetin ta or hydrophilic polyethylene glycol peg incorporated in cellulose acetate ca solution for spm and pm respectively
5504,variable tablet core compositions such as swelling polymers peo and hpmc and osmotic agents lactose nacl and kcl were studied
5505,an optimized sensitive and well controlled in vitro release design based on the flow through cell ftc was utilized to discriminate between preparations
5506,the results revealed that the presence of peg in the coating membrane accelerated the drug release rate while ta suppressed the release rate of ds
5507,in the case of spm the amount of ds released was inversely proportional to the membrane thickness where w w weight gain gave a higher ds release rate than w w
5508,results of different tablet core compositions revealed that the release rate of ds decreased as peo molecular weight increased
5509,hpmc km showed the lowest ds release rate
5510,the presence of lactose kcl or nacl pronouncedly affected ds release rate depending on polymer type in the core
5511,scanning electron microscopy sem confirmed formation of pores in the membrane that accounts for faster ds release rate
5512,these results revealed that ds could be formulated as an osmotic pump system with a prolonged zero order release pattern
5513,this study was designed to investigate the influence of volatile oil pretreated skin on in vitro permeation from films containing ionized and dodecylamine ion paired diclofenac sodium ds
5514,the involvement of skin cholesterol was investigated to determine its possible role in enhancing the permeation of ion paired ds
5515,cardamom oil produced the maximum x in vitro permeation enhancement for ion paired ds
5516,the carrageenan induced rat paw oedema reduction up to hr by cardamom oil was comparable to that of diclofenac injection s c
5517,leaching of cholesterol from excised skin in addition to increased partition coefficient following volatile oil skin pretreatment appears to be responsible for in vitro permeation enhancement of ds
5518,whereas a mild barrier perturbation effect due to altered cholesterol levels following pretreatment with volatile oils appears to increase the permeation of ion paired ds across viable skin thereby producing significant reduction of carrageenan induced paw oedema
5519,the anti inflammatory activity of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs is primarily attributed to inhibition of distinct steps in the arachidonic acid cascade particularly the cyclo oxygenase pathway
5520,diclofenac sodium a compound of this class of drugs appears to have a dual effect since it also regulates the lipoxygenase pathway
5521,study of appropriate cell systems leukocytes and whole blood in rats demonstrates that diclofenac s potent inhibition of cyclo oxygenase activity causes a sharp reduction in the formation of prostaglandin prostacyclin and thromboxane products all key mediators of inflammation
5522,recent work discloses that at higher concentrations diclofenac sodium also reduces the formation of products of the lipoxygenase pathway hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid leukotrienes
5523,the mechanism by which this evolves however appears to be unrelated to direct inhibition of lipoxygenase
5524,instead by enhancing its reincorporation into triglycerides diclofenac sodium reduces the intracellular level of free arachidonic acid
5525,the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac sodium o dichlorophenyl amino phenylacetic acid sodium salt is extensively metabolized by rat dog baboon and man
5526,the main metabolites were isolated from the urine of all species and from the bile of rat and dog and identified by spectroscopy
5527,metabolism involves direct conjugation of the unchanged drug or oxidation of the aromatic rings usually followed by conjugation
5528,sites of oxidation are either position or of the dichlorophenyl ring or alternatively position of the phenyl ring attached to the acetic acid moiety
5529,in the urine of rat baboon and man conjugates of the hydroxylated metabolites predominate but the major metabolite in dog urine is the taurine conjugate of unchanged diclofenac
5530,in the bile of rat and dog the main metabolite is the ester glucuroniade of unchanged diclofenac
5531,to compare the most popular commercially available topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in the treatment of ocular pain following radial keratotomy rk
5532,multicenter clinical trial
5533,ninety seven rk patients were randomly assigned to of treatment groups ketorolac tromethamine diclofenac sodium and moist drops as a control
5534,the patients used drop of the masked medication and drop of ofloxacin times a day for days prior to surgery
5535,they received drop of the masked medication hour before surgery immediately after surgery and times a day thereafter
5536,patients were given a written questionnaire preoperatively and were also instructed to call a central computerized telephone system to answer prerecorded questions about ocular comfort
5537,the calls were placed minutes and and hours after surgery
5538,two hundred ten statistical values were calculated to compare symptoms in the unoperated eye at baseline with symptoms in the operated eyes at each of postoperative time points
5539,only of the values were significantly different among patient groups operated versus unoperated eyes by psychometric testing
5540,both ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac sodium were more effective in reducing post rk discomfort than the control moist artificial tears
5541,given the large number of tests and the small number that tested as significant the significant differences of measurements observed among the treatment groups probably occurred by chance although the improved foreign body sensation functionality and compliance scores in the ketorolac group during the first hours might be clinically important
5542,the polyelectrolyte complex pec hydrogel beads based on chitosan cs and carrageenan cr have been studied as a controlled release device to deliver sodium diclofenac dfna in the simulated gastrointestinal condition
5543,various factors potentially influencing the drug release ie cs cr proportion dfna content types and amount of cross linking agents were also investigated
5544,the optimal formulation was obtained with cs cr proportion of and wt vol dfna
5545,the controlled release of the drug from this formulation was superior to other formulations and was able to maintain the release for approximately hours
5546,upon cross linking with glutaric acid and glutaraldehyde the resulting beads were found to be more efficient for prolonged drug release than their non cross linking counterparts
5547,the bead cross linked with glutaraldehyde was able to control the release of the drug over hours
5548,the difference in the drug release behavior can be attributed to the differences in ionic interaction between the oppositely charged ions and to the concentrations of the drug within the beads which depends on the compositions of the formulation and the ph of the dissolution medium
5549,the release of drug was controlled by the mechanism of the dissolution of dfna in the dissolution medium and the diffusion of dfna through the hydrogel beads
5550,the blood level curves of diclofenac have been studied following its administration to young and old volunteers and results of studies performed on olderly patients and those with renal disease are reported
5551,the investigations on young volunteers show that when the enteric coated tablets are taken there is a delay in the onset of absorption but thereafter absorption and elimination are rapid with a terminal elimination half life of hours
5552,the relevance of these observations to the patient who is receiving the drug chronically and who is older ill and often on drugs is discussed
5553,clearly all the different factors which may affect the handling of the drug have not yet been evaluated but the studies carried out so far suggest that the blood level profile obtained is not materially affected by age renal impairment or chronic administration
5554,among the phenolic metabolites of diclofenac in human plasma an unknown compound metabolite vi was detected by h p l c
5557,this was also found in baboon plasma
5558,metabolite vi was identified as hydroxy methoxy diclofenac by mass and n m r
5559,spectroscopic analysis
5560,comparison with synthetic reference compound confirmed its structure
5561,in plasma metabolite vi persists much longer than do unchanged diclofenac and the other phenolic metabolites
5562,in urine metabolite vi and its conjugates are excreted in trace amounts only
5563,a synthetic sample of metabolite vi was shown to be virtually inactive in animal models of inflammation and pain
5564,diclofenac and its sodium salt is one of the best known and popular therapeutic agents from the group of nsaids used in medicine in many various pharmaceutical forms
5565,therapeutic products containing diclofenac sodium salt in doses of mg and mg with a qualitatively and quantitatively diversified share of excipients and a variable dosage form of the drug solid capsules tablets with modified release were subjected to technological and pharmaceutical analysis
5566,the effect of solid formulation components of polymer character making the core and the coating of the pharmaceutical form of therapeutic products on the disintegration time and pharmaceutical availability in pharmacopoeial receptor fluids was estimated
5567,market therapeutic products with diclofenac sodium in doses of mg and mg technological analysis of the drug dosage form was conducted disintegration time of solid oral dosage forms of the drug with diclofenac sodium salt was examined and research on pharmaceutical availability of diclofenac sodium salt from tested therapeutic products was conducted using the acid phase and the buffer phase according to the fp standards for delayed release enteral dosage forms
5568,the experimental data was supplemented with the statistical analysis
5569,there are three formulations in the form of solid capsules and one formulation in the form of a coated tablet
5570,all therapeutic products bear features of a dosage form of modified release of diclofenac sodium salt frequently of a delayed release formula in the duodenum or the small intestine with regard to the limitation of typical undesirable effects after taking nsaids
5571,considerable diversity between solid capsules and the tablet with modified release during disintegration or hydration and swelling has been observed
5572,in the environment of a receptor fluid purified water ph the capsule dicloberl retard disintegrates at the fastest rate in minutes and then in the order dicloduo mg minutes and olfen sr minutes
5573,the hydration degree of gelatin walls of capsules depends on the ph of the receptor fluid
5574,the availability of diclofenac sodium salt in given receptor fluids confirms the fact of significant connection of clinical effectiveness of the tested pharmaceutical forms with the activity of hydrogen ions ph of the environment in which there are therapeutic products and excipients used for making the pharmaceutical phase
5575,tested therapeutic products with diclofenac sodium salt are differentiated by the type of a dosage form
5576,dicloberl retard contains the minimally indispensable number of simple commonly used excipients
5577,the research on the disintegration time may only be related to the products dicloberl retard olfen sr and dicloduo mg treating it as the time of deformation and disintegration of a capsule
5578,in all three types of receptor fluids the capsule dicloberl retard has the fastest disintegration rate
5579,the acid phase demonstrated stability of the products with a slight dissolution of diclofenac sodium salt on the level of the q release coefficient
5580,in the environment of artificial intestinal juice dicloberl retard is more effective releasing larger amounts of diclofenac sodium salt during hours of exposition differences from to of the q release coefficient
5581,a simple sensitive and rapid method has been developed for simultaneous separation and quantification of three different drugs oxytocin ot norfloxacin nor and diclofenac dic sodium in milk samples using capillary electrophoresis ce with uv detection at nm
5582,factors affecting the separation were ph concentration of buffer and applied voltage
5583,separation was obtained in less than min with sodium tetraborate buffer of ph and applied voltage kv
5584,the separation was carried out from uncoated fused silica capillary with effective length of cm with microm i d
5585,the carrier electrolyte gave reproducible separation with calibration plots linear over microg ml for ot microg ml for nor and microg ml for dic
5586,the lower limits of detection lod were found to be ng ml for ot and microg ml for nor and dic
5587,the method was validated for the analysis of drugs in milk samples and pharmaceutical preparations with recovery of drugs within the range with rsd
5588,this study evaluated the effects of diclofenac sodium and meloxicam on peri implant bone healing
5589,thirty male rats were divided into three groups the control group cg received no drug the diclofenac sodium group dsg received mg kg twice a day for days and the meloxicam group mg received mg kg daily for days
5590,a screw shaped titanium implant was placed in the tibia
5591,fluorochromes oxytetracycline oxt calcein ca and alizarin al were injected at and days respectively after implantation and the animals were sacrificed days after implant placement
5592,the percentages of oxt ca and al labeled bone as well as the percentages of bone to implant contact bic cortical bone area cba and trabecular bone area tba within the implant threads were evaluated
5593,bone healing was delayed in the dsg during the first days after implant placement oxt labeled bone dsg versus cg p and versus mg p
5594,the percentages of bic dsg mg and cg and cba dsg mg cg were lower in the dsg compared to the mg and cg p
5595,the percentage of tba was significantly greater in the dsg compared to the mg and cg dsg versus mg and versus cg p
5596,diclofenac sodium seemed to delay peri implant bone healing and to decrease bic whereas meloxicam had no negative effect on peri implant bone healing
5597,diclofenac sodium df na was a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug used in various aspects of inflammatory disease
5598,the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of phenobarbital pb on metabolism and toxicity of df na in vitro and explore the potential mechanism of df na induced hepatotoxicity
5599,rat hepatocytes were isolated by a modification of the two step in situ collagenase perfusion technique and the harvested rat hepatocytes were cultured with sandwich method
5600,control or pb mm pre treated hepatocytes were incubated with df na or mm in vitro and cytosolic enzyme leakage levels cytochrome p cyp a activity and metabolite content of df na in cell culture medium were measured
5601,the results showed that without any treatment hepatocyte cyp a activity gradually decreased with culture time
5602,on day four cyp a activity was of the initial value
5603,the decline of cyp a was partially reversed by cyp inducer pb and the maximum induction of cyp a was fold over control after continuous exposure of hepatocytes to mm pb for h lactic dehydrogenase ldh aspartate transaminase ast and alanine transamine alt activity and the contents of the df na metabolites hydroxydiclofenac oh df and hydroxydiclofenac oh df in media appeared to increase with increasing df na concentrations though there were no significant differences between df na exposed and control hepatocytes
5604,however if the hepatocytes first were pre treated with mm pb for days and then exposed to df na the concentrations of df na metabolites and the activity of ldh in the media were significantly higher than that of control group
5605,these findings suggest that the hepatotoxicity and metabolism of df na in rat hepatocytes are increased when hepatic cyp a activity is increased
5606,the objective of current work was to develop and evaluate thermoreversible subcutaneous drug delivery system for diclofenac sodium
5607,the poloxamer methyl cellulose hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol were used alone and in combination in different ratios to design the delivery system
5608,the physical properties like tsol gel viscosity clarity of solution and gel were evaluated
5609,the in vitro release of the drug delivery system was evaluated using membrane less method and the drug release kinetics and mechanism was predicted by applying various mathematical models to the in vitro dissolution data
5610,rabbits were used as in vivo model following subcutaneous injection to predict various pharmacokinetics parameters by applying pk summit software
5611,the in vitro and in vivo data revealed that the system consisting of the poloxamer in concentration of dp was the most capable formulation for extending the drug release and maintaining therapeutic blood level of ds for longer duration h
5612,the data obtained for drug content after autoclaving the solutions indicate that autoclaving results in degradation of ds
5613,the data also suggested that the studied polymers poloxamer mc and pg are good candidate to extend the drug release possessing a unique thermoreversible property
5614,degradation of diclofenac sodium a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug widely found in the aquatic environment was assessed using the white rot fungus trametes versicolor
5615,almost complete diclofenac removal or occurred the first hour with t versicolor pellets when the drug was added at relatively high mg l and environmentally relevant low microg l concentrations in a defined liquid medium
5616,in vivo and in vitro experiments using the cytochrome p inhibitor aminobenzotriazole and purified laccase respectively suggested at least two different mechanisms employed by t versicolor to initiate diclofenac degradation
5617,two hydroxylated metabolites hydroxydiclofenac and hydroxydiclofenac were structurally elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance as degradation intermediates in fungal cultures spiked with diclofenac
5618,both parent compound and intermediates disappeared after h leading to a decrease in ecotoxicity calculated by the microtox test
5619,laccase catalyzed transformation of diclofenac led to the formation of dichlorophenylamino benzenedimethanol which was not detected in in vivo experiments probably due to the low laccase activity levels observed through the first hours of incubation
5620,darier s disease dd is an autosomal dominant skin disorder which causative gene atpa is located atchromosome q
5621,the lesions of dd are skin coloured to brown hyperkeratotic greasy papules that coalesce into warty plaques commonly involving the seborrhoeic areas of the trunk and face especially the scalp margins temples ears and scalp
5622,the most common complaint associated with the disease is itching with exacerbations attributed to heat sweating sunlight lithium steroid therapy stress and menstruation
5623,we report a patient with dd treated with topical diclofenac sodium
5624,we report a year old patient with darier s disease
5625,he was followed in our department since and we had tried to control several flares of lesions during follow up but oral isotretinoin was not tolerated because of adverse effects and oral doxycycline showed lack of efficacy at april patient presented with new lesions involving anterior chest wall abdomen back and shoulders areas
5626,we started with diclofenac sodium in hyaluronic acid once daily only applied at abdomen and anterior chest wall
5627,after six month therapy hyperkeratotic papules were flattened and less harshness of them was noticed even some of them disappeared
5628,we consider topical diclofenac therapy as a useful alternative treatment for dd patients in which previous therapies have not shown efficacy
5629,we did not observed topical adverse effects neither systemic absorption symptoms but werecognized further and larger studies are needed to asses the efficacy and safety of this treatment in dd
5630,a two stage controlled animal trial was designed to observe the effects on normal and manually damaged articular cartilage of the rat knee joint of colchicine col and diclofenac sodium dic added into washout solutions
5631,in the first stage rats were randomized into three groups and right knees of all groups were washed out by either col dic or physiologic saline ps solutions
5632,the left side was kept as a paired control
5633,after months all knees were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically for cartilage changes
5634,in the second stage rats were randomized into four groups and a x mm defect was created surgically on the medial condyle
5635,the joints were washed out by either col dic or ps solutions
5636,at the end of the six months macroscopic microscopic and transmission electron microscopy tem evaluations were performed to observe the changes to the defective area
5637,the results showed that washout procedures with certain arthroscopic fluid modifications revealed macroscopically less fibrillation and surface changes for the col and dic groups in the first stage
5638,colchicine and diclofenac sodium solutions conducted a better effect on the thickness of the cartilage and gave better results according to mankin s criteria for degeneration
5639,in the second stage col and dic groups showed better effects on the cartilage regeneration
5640,the pharmacological agents added into the arthroscopic washout fluid may have an effect on the ultrastructure and biologic properties of the joint cartilage and may improve the results of arthroscopic treatment in chondral pathologies especially in secondary arthritis
5641,the in vitro protein binding behavior of diclofenac sodium sodium o dichloroanilino phenyl acetate in plasma and synovial fluid was investigated by equilibrium dialysis
5642,the drug was highly protein bound approximately and the extent of binding remained constant for drug concentrations of micrograms ml
5643,comparable results were obtained with human serum albumin solution g l indicating that albumin is probably the responsible protein
5644,the extent of binding remained relatively constant for drug concentrations of micrograms ml when albumin concentrations were greater than g l
5645,for albumin concentrations less than g l the extent of binding tended to decrease with increased drug concentration
5646,this concentration g l is substantially lower than that usually observed in plasma or synovial fluid of arthritic patients
5647,curvature of the scatchard plot indicated the existence of two classes of sites
5648,excellent results were obtained from fitting of the data according to two classes of sites r greater than
5649,parameter estimates sem of the number of binding sites n and n and the corresponding association constants k and k were and x m and x m respectively
5650,simultaneous samples obtained from arthritic patients indicate considerably higher total protein and albumin concentrations in plasma compared with synovial fluid but the albumin total protein ratios were essentially the same
5651,there was very little difference in plasma binding in arthritic patients compared with normal subjects
5652,the extent of binding in synovial fluid samples was consistently lower than that for plasma samples mean sd of versus respectively
5653,abstract truncated at words
5654,diclofenac sodium a non selective cyclo oxygenase inhibitor and etoricoxib a selective cyclo oxygenase inhibitor have been widely used in treatment of patients with osteo arthritis
5655,five hundred and eighty five patients with uncomplicated knee osteo arthritis were randomly allocated into equal groups and received either diclofenac sodium etoricoxib or placebo in a double blind manner
5656,the response in both the drug groups was comparable and much more than placebo group
5657,the study shows that etoricoxib provides better clinical efficacy and gastro intestinal tolerability in osteo arthritis in comparison to diclofenac sodium presumably due to the selective inhibition of cyclo oxygenase by etoricoxib
5658,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug of choice to treat arthritis because of its potential anti inflammatory and analgesic activity
5659,because of its shorter biological half life it is needed to be given frequently and at high doses to elicit the required therapeutic activity simultaneously leading to severe side effects
5660,we hypothesized that the efficient delivery of diclofenac sodium to inflammation using a magnetic colloid could reduce the dose required to bring out sufficient therapeutic response
5661,hence we have developed a diclofenac sodium loaded magnetic nanomedicine consisting of a magnetic core iron and a biocompatible polymeric shell ethylcellulose for parenteral administration
5662,these core shell nanoparticles were synthesized by an emulsion solvent evaporation process
5663,two drug loading methods were analyzed the first one being drug addition prior to the emulsion solvent evaporation process leading to drug entrapment into the polymeric network and the second method based on diclofenac sodium surface adsorption onto the preformed nanoparticles
5664,compared to drug adsorption the entrapment of this active agent into the polymeric matrix yielded a higher drug loading and a slower drug release profile
5665,such nanocomposites possessed very important characteristics such as unusually high drug loading enhanced magnetic susceptibility and prolonged drug release indicating their potential use as nanocarriers for efficient delivery of diclofenac sodium to inflammation sites
5666,photorefractive keratectomy for treating myopia has been associated with severe postoperative pain
5667,the purpose of the present study was to investigate in a rabbit model the early effects of laser ablation on the physiology of the sensory nerves of the cornea
5668,neurophysiologic monitoring of the corneal nerves was carried out to hours after mm diameter circular prk ablations with a central depth of microns
5669,the effect of topical and diclofenac sodium on the physiologic response to chemical and mechanical stimulation was evaluated
5670,corneas were prepared for anatomic studies of corneal innervation
5671,heightened neural activity was observed in the corneal nerves after ablation and exaggerated responses to sensory stimulation with hypertonic sodium chloride solutions were recorded
5672,diclofenac sodium at decreased the response to m nacl and m nacl to and mean standard error of the control response
5673,mechanically sensitive nerves were more resistant to diclofenac diclofenac had no effect but diclofenac reduced the response significantly p
5674,anatomic observations showed that the ablation extended through the neural plexus
5675,by hours long neurites tipped with growth cones had advanced into the injured region indicating the initiation of neural regeneration
5676,diclofenac sodium was effective in attenuating neural activity in the cornea after excimer laser ablation
5677,the action of this agent was shown to be different from that of a topical anesthetic which rapidly and totally inhibited the response to all forms of stimulation
5678,the disperse oil droplets of w o w multiple emulsions contain small water droplets in which drugs could be incorporated but the structure of these emulsions is also the reason for possible instability
5679,due to the middle oil phase which acts as a semipermeable membrane the passage of water across the oil phase can take place
5680,however the emulsions have been produced in a two step production process so not only the leakage of encapsulated drug molecules out of the inner water phase during storage but also a production induced reduction of the encapsulation rate should be considered
5681,the aim of this study was to ascertain how far the production induced reduction of the encapsulation rate relates to the size of inner water droplets and to evaluate the relevance of multiple emulsions as drug carrier for diclofenac sodium
5682,therefore multiple emulsions were produced according to a central composite design
5683,during the second production step it was observed that the parameters pressure and temperature have an influence on the size of the oil droplets in the w o w multiple emulsions
5684,further experiments with different w o emulsions resulted in w o w multiple emulsions with different encapsulation rates of diclofenac sodium due to the different sizes of the inner water droplets which were obtained in the first production step
5685,two novel analytical methodologies using capillary electrophoresis ce and liquid chromatography lc were developed and compared for the determination of diclofenac sodium in commercial and simulated tablet formulations
5686,the ce analysis was performed in a bare fused silica capillary with microm id and total length of cm cm to the detector with a buffer solution of mm sodium tetraborate ph the applied voltage was kv and acetaminophen was used as the internal standard is
5687,the lc analysis was performed with a lichrospher rp microm column and a mobile phase of methanol diluted glacial acetic acid parts in at a flow rate of ml min with propylparaben as the is
5688,in both analyses detection was by ultraviolet absorption at nm
5689,under optimized conditions the ce migration times for the diclofenac sodium standard and acetaminophen is were and min respectively and the lc retention times for the diclofenac sodium standard and propylparaben is were and min respectively
5690,the resolution and efficiency for ce were and x plates m respectively and for lc and x plates m respectively
5691,calibration curves of peak area versus concentration gave correlation coefficients of for ce and for lc
5692,the limits of detection and quantitation were and microg ml respectively for ce and and microg ml respectively for lc
5693,coefficients of variation were and for ce and lc respectively
5694,average recoveries obtained with ce and lc were and respectively
5695,although both methodologies were shown to be suitable for the determination of diclofenac sodium in tablets performing in a similar manner with regard to several aspects linearity recovery and specificity ce provided faster analysis and better column efficiency whereas lc provided superior repeatability and sensitivity
5696,this preliminary study compared placebo with diclofenac mg rising to mg per day in a crossover study for seven days in thirteen inpatients
5697,regardless of the marked overall effect of hospitalization an additional effect of diclofenac on grip strength and p i p
5698,joint swelling was demonstrated as well as a significant reduction in pain and in analgesic requirements
5699,in addition an improved technique for assessing the effect of nsai drugs on p i p
5700,joint swelling is described
5701,the characteristics of the osmotic concentration system under conditions of sodium diclofenac treatment were studied in wistar rats with normally functioning vasopressin gene and homozygotic brattleboro rats completely lacking endogenous vasopressin
5702,blockade of prostaglandin synthesis in rats with different neurohypophyseal status stimulated urinary osmolality to a different degree
5703,different contribution of sodium cations and urea to osmotic concentration was revealed
5704,the objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac sodium and its five metabolites following administration of a mg oral dose to healthy subjects and patients with either chronic active hepatitis of varying morphology or alcoholic cirrhosis
5705,six healthy subjects chronic active hepatitis patients and alcoholic cirrhosis patients were enrolled in this prospective open label parallel study
5706,blood samples were drawn at and hours and urine samples were collected for hours after administration of a single oral dose of diclofenac sodium
5707,the mean area under the serum concentration time curve extrapolated to infinity oral clearance half life maximal concentration and time to peak concentration for diclofenac and its metabolites were determined and compared using analysis of variance
5708,cirrhotics had a mean sd diclofenac auc value ng h ml significantly different p from hepatitis patients ng h ml and healthy subjects ng h ml whereas healthy subjects and hepatitis patients had similar values
5709,comparable results were found for hydroxydiclofenac
5710,the auc values for hydroxydiclofenac and hydroxy methoxydiclofeanc were significantly different when healthy subjects were compared to cirrhotics
5711,however hepatitis subjects were not significantly different from either group
5712,the results indicate that hepatitis does not alter the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac
5713,alcoholic cirrhosis increased the mean diclofenac auc approximately three times compared to normal subjects indicating that one third of the usual dose in cirrhotics would produce equivalent auc values in normal subjects and subjects with alcoholic cirrhosis
5714,however since pharmacodynamic measurements were not made and no increase in untoward or side effects was noted in the alcoholic cirrhosis patients after a single dose maintenance doses should be titrated to patients response
5715,it has been shown in experiments on mice that sodium diclofenac and indomethacin inhibited antibody titers and the number of rosette forming cells rfc in mice immunized with sheep red blood cells
5716,sodium salicylate in all test doses did not produce any shifts in rosette formation but lowered the number of rfc
5717,as regards the immunodepressant activity sodium diclofenac compares very favourably with indomethacin and sodium salicylate
5718,enhancement of the immunoreactivity inhibition caused by the drugs was not proportional to the increase in their antiphlogistic effects determined by the selye model of inflammation
5719,ninety patients with active rheumatoid arthritis took part in a cross over trial comparing diclofenac sodium diflunisal and naproxen
5720,the efficacy of the three drugs was similar though there were trends in favour of diclofenac sodium in some measurements
5721,the incidence of side effects was similar with the three drugs and each was chosen by a significant group of patients as continuation therapy at the end of the study
5722,a randomized double blind comparative clinical study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of castor oil with diclofenac sodium in patients with knee osteoarthritis
5723,subjects with symptoms of knee osteoarthritis were given a castor oil capsule ml n thrice daily for weeks or a capsule of diclofenac sodium n mg thrice daily for weeks
5724,the subjects completed an overall evaluation of symptom relief at weeks and weeks of completed treatment
5725,the subjects were evaluated by clinical routine laboratory and radiographic investigations for improvement of disease conditions and also for adverse drug reaction
5726,on completion of weeks treatment it was observed that both drugs were significantly effective in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis p and adverse drug reactions were high with diclofenac sodium whereas with castor oil there were no adverse effects reported
5727,the present study indicates that castor oil can be used as an effective therapy in primary knee osteoarthritis
5728,the effects of formulation variables on the release profile of diclofenac sodium ds from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose hpmc and chitosan matrix tablets were studied
5729,ds tablets were prepared by wet granulation and direct compression methods and different ratios of hpmc and chitosan were used
5730,physical properties of the prepared tablets and targeted commercial sustained release sr tablet and the drug release were studied in tablets that were placed in m hcl for h and phosphate buffer solution was added to reach ph value of in vitro studies showed that hpmc contained sr formulation with direct dry compression method is the optimum formulation due to its better targeting profile in terms of release
5731,this formulation also exhibited the best fitted formulation into the zero order kinetics
5732,the precision and accuracy of the analytical method were also checked
5733,the repeatability and reproducibility of the method were also determined
5734,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid have been shown to decrease calcium excretion in the experimental animal in human volunteers and in calcium stone formers
5735,paraplegics tend to be hypercalciuric during the first years after their injury and this is said to be a predisposing factor for stone formation in these patients
5736,the effect of the nsaid diclofenac sodium was studied in traumatic paraplegics who had sustained their injury to months previously h urine samples collected before and weeks and weeks after oral diclofenac sodium mg tds were analysed for calcium uric acid glycosaminoglycans gags and volume
5737,there were no significant changes in urinary volume uric acid and gags excretion
5738,however urinary calcium concentration and h calcium excretion decreased significantly following weeks and weeks treatment with diclofenac sodium
5739,the aim of this work was to study the feasibility of using positron emission tomography pet imaging as a new tool to detect transdermal penetration of topical drugs in human subjects
5740,the compound used in the study is sodium dichlorophenyl amino phenyl acetate better known as diclofenac sodium
5741,this molecule belongs to the family of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and is considered one of the first choices among non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases it is widely used and commercially present in a large number of pharmaceutical forms and formulations
5742,c labeled diclofenac has been synthesized and coformulated as an internal indicator with a proprietary preparation based on the use of a sprayer
5743,the radiolabeled preparation was topically administered to healthy volunteers and pet imaging was used to evaluate transdermal penetration
5744,results obtained have demonstrated the efficacy of pet and radiolabeled tracers for the evaluation of transdermal penetration of active pharmaceutical ingredients as topical formulations
5745,the aim of this study was to prepare diclofenac sodium dna solid lipid nanoparticles slns by a modified emulsion solvent evaporation method for transdermal delivery
5746,five independent processing parameters including the lipid matrix emulsifiers co emulsifiers water dispersed phase and organic phase were assessed systematically to enhance the entrapment of dna
5747,the slns produced by optimal formulation were submicrometre size with low polydispersity index the entrapment efficiency was about and the drug loading was about
5748,shape and surface morphology were determined by transmission electron microscopy which revealed the fairly spherical and core shell shapes of the slns
5749,the in vitro release of slns showed a two step release pattern one initial burst release followed by a second slow release phase
5750,in the in vitro cutaneous permeation studies value of flux obtained for dna solution was higher than that of slns suspension
5751,slns had also been shown to improve the dermal localization of dna
5752,to explore the mechanism by which diclofenac sodium eyedrops exert an adverse effect on the cornea
5753,in healthy japanese volunteers diclofenac sodium solution was instilled into one eye times daily for weeks
5754,only vehicle was applied to the other eye
5755,tear samples were taken before drug treatment at weeks on the final day of treatment and at weeks
5756,prostaglandin e and substance p concentrations in tears were measured using enzyme immunoassays
5757,after treatment for weeks concentrations of both prostaglandin e and substance p in tears from diclofenac sodium treated eyes had decreased significantly and both had returned to baseline levels by weeks
5758,no significant changes were seen in prostaglandin e and substance p levels in vehicle treated eyes at any time points
5759,diclofenac sodium eyedrops concurrently reduced concentrations of prostaglandin e and substance p in tears
5760,depletion of substance p a pain associated neurotransmitter by diclofenac sodium may promote development of corneal complications
5761,in the present work an attempt was made to target diclofenac sodium to its site of action through magnetic gelatin microspheres
5762,the gelatin magnetic microspheres loaded with w w of diclofenac sodium and w w of magnetite were formulated by emulsification cross linking with glutaraldehyde
5763,the formulated microspheres were characterized by particle size distribution scanning electron microscopy sem differential scanning calorimetry dsc x ray diffraction and in vitro release studies
5764,the in vivo distribution and targetability of gelatin magnetic microspheres after i v
5765,administration were studied in rabbits
5766,the formulated microspheres were below microm and spherical in nature as evidenced by the sem photographs
5767,dsc and x ray diffraction studies revealed the absence of drug polymer interaction
5768,encapsulated diclofenac sodium was released slowly more than days
5769,application of sonication as external stimuli to enhance drug release during release study has slightly increased the release rate
5770,the formulated microspheres were injected intravenously after keeping a suitable magnet near the target area
5771,the quantity of drug available at the target and non target area was determined by hplc
5772,about of injected dose localized near the target organ
5773,majority of injected dose was recovered from lungs spleen and liver indicating localization of microspheres in these organs
5774,further studies are required to improve the targeting efficiency of gelatin microspheres by modifying surface properties to overcome phagocytosis and by selecting suitable particle size to avoid the entrapment of microspheres in non target organs
5775,sustained release polymer beads containing diclofenac sodium dna dispersed in compritol and encapsulated in calcium alginate shell were prepared utilizing factorial design
5776,the effect of sodium alginate concentration drug compritol weight ratio and cacl concentration on drug content time for and of the drug to be released and mean dissolution time mdt were evaluated with analysis of variance anova
5777,an increase in the level of all these factors caused retardation in the release and t t and mdt were increased
5778,the drug release was dependent on the ph of the release media
5779,a formula that gives a release comparable to commercial products was prepared
5780,a useful model that combines paracentesis with administration of a leukotactic factor was developed in order to study the effects of topical diclofenac sodium on various aspects of ocular inflammation
5781,the increases in intraocular pressure iop and secondary aqueous humor protein concentration induced in rabbits by anterior chamber paracentesis as well as leukocyte accumulation in the anterior chamber induced by formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine were significantly reduced by topical application of diclofenac sodium at concentrations of mm w v and higher
5782,lower doses consistently affected only iop and secondary protein concentrations
5783,a slight paracentesis induced miosis was refractory to diclofenac sodium
5784,that this potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis can reduce important signs of ocular inflammation is well supported in this model
5785,microspheres of polyvinylalcohol pva containing diclofenac sodium were prepared by an emulsion chemical cross linking method
5786,a statistical design was used to study the variables that affect the preparation of microspheres and to study the release profile of diclofenac from the microspheres
5787,to account for the drug content a mass balance study of the process was performed
5788,a high concentration of polyvinylalcohol a high stirring speed and a low level of glutaraldehyde were found to be important to obtain spherical and discrete microspheres
5789,the concentration of polyvinylalcohol and the amount of heavy liquid paraffin were found to be critical factors in influencing the t value
5790,almost of the total diclofenac sodium added was accounted for in mass balance studies
5791,the study was carried out to compare the analgesic effect of diclofenac sodium and indomethacin suppositories for management of right mediolateral episiotomy repair
5792,a total of patients who gave birth vaginally with right mediolateral episitomy were randomly assigned to receive mg diclofenac sodium suppositories day g n or mg indomethacin supposotories day g n after episiotomy repair and postpartum for three days
5793,pain ratings were recorded before the first hour and hours after medication
5794,the verbal rating scale vrs and visual analog scale vas were used for pain recording
5795,the independent t test mann whitney u and wilcoxon rank test were used for statistical analysis and spearman correlation analysis was used for comparison between vrs and vas
5796,diclofenac sodium was a more effective analgesic than indomethacin suppositories for right mediolateral episiotomy pain
5797,for g the first hour vrs was points and vas points for g the first hour vrs was points vas points this difference was statistically significant p mann whitney u test
5798,for g at the th hour vrs was points and vas points for g at the th hour vrs was points and vas was points the difference was statistically significant p mann whitney u test
5799,the first and th hour pain scores vas vas vrs vrs were decreased dramatically for both groups p wilcoxon rank test
5800,a positive correlation was obtained between the first and th hour vrs and vas by spearman correlation analysis r s n p
5801,the two analgesics were effective after episiotomy repair however diclofenac sodium suppositories may be the preferred choice because they were more effective
5802,capillary zone electrophoresis was employed for the determination of diclofenac sodium using an end column amperometric detection with a carbon fiber microelectrode at a constant potential of v vs saturated calomel electrode
5803,the optimum conditions of separation and detection are x mol l nahpo x mol l nahpo ph for the buffer solution kv for the separation voltage kv and s for the injection voltage and the injection time respectively
5804,the limit of detection is x mol l or fmol s n
5805,the relative standard deviation is for the migration time and for the electrophoretic peak current
5806,the method was applied to the determination of diclofenac sodium in human urine
5807,the crystal structure of the hydrate of the antiphlogistic drug diclofenac sodium was determined to explain the unusual dissolution behaviour in ethyl acetate
5808,the compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group p m with a b c a und beta degrees
5809,the unit cell contains two symmetry independent formula units chclno na ho
5810,there are molecule layers and sodium water layers which show order disorder phenomena
5811,this study addresses how to mask the undesirable taste of diclofenac sodium ds without interfering with an adequate rate of drug release
5812,ds microcapsules were successfully prepared using a system of ethylcellulose ec toluene petroleum ether
5813,the system was optimized by the construction of the phase diagram and determination of the amount of ec precipitated under different solvent non solvent ratios to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparing good microcapsules
5814,microcrystalline cellulose avicel and lactose were mixed with ds powder and converted into spherical cores by the wet agglomeration technique which facilitated coacervation and formation of thin and uniform microcapsule walls
5815,diethylphthalate dep and polyethyleneglycol peg in different concentrations or w w were used as plasticizers to impart better elasticity to the microcapsules
5816,the microcapsules were evaluated for ds released against crushed commercial ds enteric coated tablet voltaren
5817,the prepared microcapsules were taste evaluated by a taste panel of volunteers
5818,the results revealed that the optimum solvent non solvent ratio required for microcapsule formation was microcapsules containing peg or dep showed a faster rate of ds release compared to that obtained from other microcapsules and crushed commercial enteric coated tablets voltaren
5819,the palatability and the taste of ds were significantly improved by microencapsulation
5820,the extent of taste masking was influenced by the microcapsule core wall ratio the presence of additives within the core the type and concentration of plasticizer and initial core size
5821,a rapid and sensitive polarographic method was developed for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of the neurotoxic contaminant benzaldehyde in na diclofenac injections and in benzyl alcohol used for parental formulations
5822,a well defined differential pulse dp polarographic peak or a sampled direct current sdc wave was obtained at v vs silver silver chloride reference electrode in britton robinson buffer ph and at v in m licl solution
5823,the reduction step involves a two electron process corresponding to the formation of benzyl alcohol
5824,no peaks were observed in the anodic branch of the cyclic voltammogram emphasizing the occurrence of an irreversible process
5825,the peak current versus concentration relationship was found to be linear up to microg ml with the detection limit of ng ml and quantitation limit of ng ml
5826,the relative standard deviations s d
5827,obtained for concentration levels of benzaldehyde as low as microg ml with the sdc and dp methods were and n respectively
5828,benzyl alcohol and na diclofenac are not electrochemically active and metabisulfite reductions at and v do not interfere with the benzaldehyde reduction peak
5829,the proposed methods dp and sdc polarography have been applied satisfactorily to the determination of benzaldehyde traces in benzyl alcohol and in different pharmaceutical products such as na diclofenac injectable formulations
5830,to report a case of spontaneous corneal perforation after radiotherapy connected with long term use of topical diclofenac sodium
5831,a year old man presented with corneal melting and spontaneous corneal perforation
5832,from his medical history it was learned that he underwent radiotherapy for his nasopharyngeal carcinoma months ago
5833,he has been on artificial tears and topical diclofenac sodium for month for his dry eye
5834,diclofenac sodium was discontinued and the corneal perforation site was sutured along with a bandage contact lens application
5835,melting area disappeared and stromal opacity was detected at the site of corneal perforation
5836,use of long term diclofenac sodium for dry eye after radiotherapy was possibly responsible for the spontaneous corneal perforation in our patient
5837,it should always be borne in mind that topical diclofenac sodium should be used with caution in patients with compromised ocular surface
5838,diclofenac sodium was formulated as novel enteric microcapsules for improved delivery to the intestine using the polymers cellulose acetate phthalate cap and ethyl cellulose ec
5839,the enteric coating was given using an innovative technique combining the wet granulation and thermal change methods
5840,the novel process was analysed for its capability to produce microcapsules of uniform size good flowability uniform drug loading and maximum entrapment efficacy and the absence of interaction between drug and process parameters as well as the polymers
5841,in vitro release study was carried out in simulated gastric fluid sgf for first h and simulated intestinal fluid sif for next h the best formulation that contained cellulose acetate phthalate and ethyl cellulose in the concentration of at drug polymer ratio b was further evaluated using in vivo for its pharmacodynamic efficacy and ulcerogenicity
5842,in addition to sustained and uniform release of drug the formulation b showed better anti inflammatory activity than the marketed formulation and retarded drug release in the gastric medium
5843,the biological examination of incised stomach showed no histological alterations in term of mucous surface cells and glands
5844,in this study microspheres of diclofenac sodium an anti inflammatory agent were prepared by utilizing a natural polysaccharide chitosan h the objective of this investigation was to sustain the action of diclofenac sodium and to show the effect of various conditions on release kinetics
5845,for this reason factorial design experiments were performed
5846,the independent variables in the factorial design were chitosan h concentration tripolyphosphate concentration and stabilization time and in the factorial design were chitosan h and tripolyphosphate concentrations
5847,the dependent variables t and the total drug content were investigated by the polynomial equations
5848,the release profiles were evaluated kinetically and the best fit was obtained by the higuchi equation
5849,diclofenac voltarol has no effect on carbohydrate metabolism insulin levels or tolbutamide metabolism nor does it enhance the effect of tolbutamide biguanide or glibenclamide
5850,although it produces minimal increases in prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in healthy volunteers it does not significantly affect the individual clotting factors nor does it in patients enhance the effect of acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon
5851,like many other other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs it increases platelet aggregation time
5852,there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between aspirin and diclofenac
5853,two independent studies have shown that aspirin markedly reduces the bioavailability of diclofenac as measured by area under the curve
5854,furthermore patients exhibiting aspirin sensitivity as bronchospasm are likely to react to diclofenac in the same manner
5855,finally diclofenac as tested using excretion of cr labelled red cells induces minimal gastrointestinal blood loss significantly less so than aspirin or naproxen
5856,anaphylaxis due to diclofenac sodium voltaren is rare
5857,we describe a year old woman who received a suppository of diclofenac for analgesia hours after cesarean section
5858,she developed severe angioedema and profound hemodynamic shock minutes after the diclofenac to which she had been exposed in the past without any side effects
5859,there are few reports of such an acute life threatening multisystem reaction to this drug in the english literature
5860,topical gel formulations of diclofenac sodium were prepared by using sodium carboxymethylcellulose nacmc a low toxicity cellulose polymer as a gel forming material that is biocompatible and biodegradable
5861,the influence of various formulation variables such as initial drug concentrations and nacmc concentration and certain skin permeation enhancers on release characteristics of the diclofenac sodium from the prepared gels through a standard cellophane membrane was studied in comparison with four commercially available gel formulations of diclofenac sodium
5862,the cumulative amounts released and the apparent release rates were higher for the prepared gels in comparison with the commercial formulations
5863,skin permeation studies using abdominal rat skin revealed good improvement of skin permeation characteristics of diclofenac sodium using nacmc gels as compared to the commercial gels
5864,the cumulative amount permeated at h microg cm steady state flux jss microg cm h lag time tl h permeability coefficient kp cm s partition coefficient k and diffusion coefficient d cm s were determined for the prepared gels in comparison with the commercial gels
5865,skin permeation enhancers such as isopropyl alcohol ipa tween and alpha tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate tpgs exhibited little or no effect on the permeation characteristics of diclofenac sodium
5866,infrared ir spectrum and differential scanning calorimetry dsc studies on the pure diclofenac sodium nacmc and their physical mixture at a ratio revealed that there was no positive evidence for the interactions between the drug and nacmc indicating the compatibility of the drug and the vehicle
5867,based on experimental results preparation of diclofenac sodium gels using nacmc vehicle is promising
5868,the aim of this work was to develop an analytical method for a simultaneous determination of cyanocobalamin vitamin b betamethasone and diclofenac present in pharmaceutical formulations by high performance liquid chromatography assuring rapidity accuracy precision and selectivity
5869,the working conditions were as follows rp column of mm x mm id and a particle size of microm mobile phase acetonitrile water v v ph adjusted with acetic acidl flow gradient from to ml min
5870,injection volume of microl temperature degrees c and detection at nm
5871,the method was adequately validated and linearity accuracy as well as the system method and interday precision for each active principle were determined
5872,twenty eight eyes of age matched patients who had planned extracapsular cataract extraction with or without intraocular lens implantation were enrolled into a double blind randomised actively controlled study of groups
5873,each group of eyes was assigned to receive diclofenac sodium naclof eye drops or prednisolone acetate eye suspension
5874,the patients received either diclofenac sodium eye drops or prednisolone acetate eye suspension four times a day as their post operative anti inflammatory medication for a period of four weeks
5875,no significant difference was noticed in the subjective assessment of pain and conjunctival injection in the days follow up period except day in the diclofenac sodium group p
5876,other measured objective variables of inflammation such as anterior chamber cells and flare showed no significant difference from the rd th postoperative days p
5877,the result demonstrated that diclofenac sodium eye drops was as effective as prednisolone acetate eye suspension in the control of postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery and could serve as a viable alternative to topical steroids in nigerians who are steroid responders
5878,the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of polymer blends on the in vitro release profile of diclofenac sodium
5879,several controlled release matrices of diclofenac sodium with different proportions of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc viscosity grade and mpa s carbopol and lactose as a water soluble filler were prepared
5880,the results showed that when hpmc viscosity grade mpa s alone was used as matrix former diclofenac sodium was released fast but the release rate became slower with hpmc viscosity grade mpa s at higher polymer drug ratios more than
5881,however in lower polymer drug ratios lower than the release rate still was fast
5882,the results showed that carbopol can extend the release time appreciably but the release profiles had considerable fluctuations and drug release in first hours was slow but increased appreciably with time at the end of profiles
5883,when an appropriate blend of hpmc viscosity grade or mpa s and carbopol was used the drug release became more uniform and its kinetic approached to zero order and release fluctuations were diminished
5884,the results with these polymer blends showed that it is possible to reduce the total amounts of polymer in each formulation
5885,according to kinetic analysis data drug release from these matrix tablets did not follow fick s law of diffusion and the results were in agreement with the earlier reports
5886,controlled release tablets containing mg diclofenac sodium ds and mastic with other natural additives were prepared
5887,drug release was examined and stability was studied using non isothermal and isothermal thermogravimetric analysis tga
5888,the bioavailability of two controlled release tablet formulations was studied and compared to that of commercial tablets and rabbit stomachs were also histologically examined h after administration of the various tablets
5889,additives of pectin and sodium alginate indicated the controlled release profile of the drug
5890,non isothermal tg revealed two stages of thermal decomposition for all formulations
5891,isothermal tg revealed that degradation of the drug in the tablet formulations follows first order kinetics
5892,the obtained degradation rate constants at various temperatures were plotted according to the arrhenius equation
5893,the degradation rate constant at c was determined and used in estimation of shelf life
5894,the obtained shelf lives of all formulations ranged from years
5895,in comparative studies with commercial tablets the bioavailability of the drug from the two formulated tablets had no statistically significant difference in terms of the auc and produced prolonged blood levels of ds with a delayed peak
5896,the two controlled release tablet formulations resulted in no histological alterations in the stomach in terms of mucous surface cells and glands in comparison commercial tablets resulted in a disrupted mucous layer necrotic ulcerations hemorrhaging and inflammatory cell infiltration along the base of the gastric glands
5897,penetratin a cell penetrating peptide is embedded within a reversed hexagonal h ii mesophase for improved transdermal delivery of sodium diclofenac na dfc
5898,the h ii mesophase serves as the solubilization reservoir and gel matrix whereas penetratin is the transdermal penetration enhancer for the drug
5899,the systems were characterized and the interactions between the components were determined by saxs atr ftir and sd nmr
5900,high affinity of na dfc to glycerol monooleate gmo was revealed associated with increasing the order within the water channels
5901,this affinity is enhanced upon heating and seems to be associated with gmo dehydration
5902,penetratin pen is entrapped at the hydrophilic region of the h ii mesophase between the gmo headgroups reducing the order of the system and decreasing the size of the hexagonal domains
5903,the transdermal delivery rate of na dfc through porcine skin from the h ii mesophases was enhanced by pen and so also the cumulative transport crossing the skin
5904,pen induced accelerated drug diffusion through the stratum corneum towards the different skin layers
5905,the transdermal delivery enhancement is explained from the results of the atr ftir analysis
5906,it seems that pen accelerates the structural transition of skin lipids from hexagonal to liquid
5907,the disordering results in enhanced diffusion of na dfc through the stratum corneum followed by enhanced overall penetration of the drug
5908,diclofenac sodium mg kg i v
5909,was given preoperatively to small children age y
5910,vt and total plasma clearance were higher than in adults but the elimination half life was similar
5911,the effect of the antiinflammatory non steroid drug feloran on platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo was studied
5912,epinephrine adenosine diphosphate and collagen were used as aggregating agents
5913,the platelet aggregation and platelet release reaction were evaluated automatically on two separate curves using a lumi aggregometer chrono log corp
5914,it was established that feloran in vitro did not influence the aggregation with adp but it inhibited the aggregation with collagen and the second wave of the aggregation with epinephrine
5915,the changes in the percent of the maximal aggregation with all aggregating agents and the reaction time with collagen were demonstrative
5916,the studies carried out in healthy volunteers in vivo exhibited an inhibition of the aggregation both with epinephrine and collagen the second wave of the aggregation curve being inhibited with epinephrine
5917,the data obtained were interpreted as a result of the inhibition of the platelet release reaction
5918,the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac was studied in an initial two week assessment study in patients with rheumatic disease
5919,during the first week patients received x mg diclofenac t d s with subsequent dosage adjustments according to response
5920,most completers showed improvement in joint pain and functional grade and patients rating of their condition indicated a significant improvement
5921,nine patients were withdrawn because of poor symptom control or side effects and there were a number of other minor side effects not necessitating withdrawal
5922,however there were no persistent or lasting side effects and laboratory tests revealed no significant abnormalities
5923,in a two week double blind study diclofenac was compared with indomethacin in outpatients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis
5924,dosage in the first week was x mg tablet of either diclofenac or indomethacin random allocation t d s with further adjustments as necessary
5925,there were no significant differences in the effectiveness of the two drugs and no differences in dosage requirements
5926,three patients were withdrawn from each treatment group
5927,gastrointestinal side effects predominated in the diclofenac treated group with central nervous system unwanted effects more frequent in the indomethacin group
5928,the in vitro effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren on the ultrastructure of healthy donors platelets was examined and compared with those induced by aspirin asa
5929,in distinction to asa which causes loss of platelet pseudopodia voltaren induced an increase and marked elongation of these pseudopodia
5930,the implication of this finding in the explanation of the decreased platelet aggregation caused by the drug is discussed
5931,voltaren increased the phagocytotic activity of the individual platelet although the overall ability of the cells to phagocytize latex particles was not markedly increased
5932,platelets incubated with voltaren showed a decrease in their total protein synthesizing capacity
5933,voltaren did not exert any effect on the internal ultrastructure platelet factor and calcium content of the incubated platelets
5934,a randomized double blind parallel group clinical trial compared diclofenac sodium voltaren ciba geigy summit nj with aspirin for the treatment of acute sprains and or strains of the knee or ankle
5935,one hundred thirty nine patients were admitted to the study
5936,patients received either mg mg twice daily of diclofenac n or g g three times daily of aspirin n for to days
5937,forty seven diclofenac patients and aspirin patients mean age for both groups years were evaluated to determine the efficacy of each treatment
5938,both groups experienced significant p less than improvements for all efficacy variables measured
5939,treating sprains and strains with diclofenac rather than with aspirin allowed an earlier return to activity
5940,of those patients who achieved playing fitness those in the diclofenac group resumed athletic activities in a mean of days compared with a mean of days for patients in the aspirin group
5941,although the overall multivariate f was nonsignificant p the univariate f for days required to resume playing fitness was significantly p shorter in the diclofenac group
5942,while the nonsignificant multivariate result suggests that the significance may be due to chance it is also possible that there was a trend toward earlier resumption of activities with diclofenac treatment compared to aspirin but an insufficient sample size to demonstrate the trend statistically
5943,since others have reported such a trend without the greater controls of a multivariate analysis this area warrants further research
5944,the purpose of the study was to screen the effects of formulation factors on the in vitro release profile of diclofenac sodium from matrix pellets compressed into multiple unit pellet system mups tablets using design of experiment doe
5945,extended release of diclofenac sodium was accomplished using carbopol g as matrix substance
5946,according to fractional factorial design ffd four formulations of diclofenac sodium mups matrix tablets were prepared
5947,the process of direct pelletization and subsequently compression of the pellets into tablets was applied in order to investigate a different approach in formulation of matrix systems and to achieve a better control of the process factors over the principal response the release of the drug
5948,the investigated factors were x the percentage of polymer carbopol g x crushing strength of the tablet and x different batches of the diclofenac sodium
5949,in vitro dissolution time profiles at different sampling times were chosen as responses
5950,results of drug release studies indicated that drug release rates vary between different formulations with a range of to h to complete dissolution
5951,the most important impact on the drug release had factor x the percentage of polymer carbopol g
5952,the polymer percentage is suggested as release regulator for diclofenac sodium release from mups matrix tablets
5953,all other investigated factors had no significant influence on the release profile of diclofenac sodium
5954,an isothermal heat conduction microcalorimeter has been used to study the stability of diclofenac sodium both alone and its inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin in aqueous solution
5955,the rates of heat evolved during degradation of diclofenac sodium have been measured by a highly sensitive microcalorimetric technique as function of concentration ph and temperature
5956,the calorimetric accessible data have been incorporated in the equations for determination of rate constants change in enthalpy and order of reaction
5957,the decomposition of diclofenac sodium both alone and its inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin in solution corresponds to a pseudo first order reaction
5958,the values of rate constants k s at k calculated from the variation of heat evolution with the time for the degradation of diclofenac sodium at ph and its inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin at ph are found to be x x x x and x h respectively
5959,there is good agreement between calorimetric determined t and literature values
5960,it has been found that beta cyclodextrin retards the degradation of diclofenac sodium
5961,the kinetic parameters have been calculated for the reaction
5962,the negative entropy of activation suggests the formation of an ordered transition state
5963,in this study we prepared a magnetic composite based on amine functionalized chitosan aminochitosan amcs and fe
5964,the pig has been suggested as an animal model in biomedical research because of its physiological similarity to man
5965,therefore the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of diclofenac sodium voltaren were studied in four yucatan minipigs after intravenous administration of and mg and oral administration of mg in a solution of ml buffer ml water and ml water and the results compared to historical data in man
5966,the absolute bioavailability after oral administration of ml buffer ml water and ml water solutions were and respectively compared to approximately in man
5967,the total plasma clearance in minipigs was fivefold slower than in humans vs ml hr kg
5968,the plasma levels of the metabolites hydroxy hydroxy hydroxy dihydroxy and hydroxy methoxy diclofenac were considerably lower in minipigs than in man after both i v
5969,and oral administration
5970,these results suggest slower metabolism and or enterohepatic recirculation of the parent drug in minipigs
5971,the volume of distribution of the central compartment was less in humans than in pigs vs ml kg
5972,the terminal half lives of the parent drug were similar in pigs hr and humans hr
5973,the rate of oral drug absorption increased in the order of ml aqueous ml aqueous and ml buffered solutions ka and hr respectively
5974,these trends are similar in man and suggest that both buffering and intake volume can affect diclofenac absorption
5975,abstract truncated at words
5976,prescribing of diclofenac for children usually involves a dose different from commercially available strengths
5977,this drug is available only as tablets which can be divided only so many times before the dose obtained becomes inaccurate
5978,in addition children may have difficulty swallowing tablets
5979,for these reasons a compounding formula for a liquid dosage form is essential to ensure effective delivery of the drug to pediatric patients
5980,to develop a compounding formula for diclofenac sodium and to determine the extended physical and chemical stability of this compound when stored in amber polyvinyl chloride pvc prescription bottles under refrigeration and at room temperature
5981,a suspension of diclofenac sodium mg ml was prepared from commercially available diclofenac sodium tablets with ora blend as the suspending and flavouring agent
5982,the suspension was packaged in ml amber pvc prescription bottles and stored at either room temperature c or under refrigeration c
5983,samples were collected on days and chemical stability was determined using a validated stability indicating high performance liquid chromatography method
5984,at each sampling time the suspensions were checked for changes in appearance i e colour layering caking ease of resuspension odour and ph
5985,the diclofenac sodium suspensions were very stable retaining at least of the original concentration for up to days regardless of storage temperature
5986,there were no apparent changes in the physical appearance of the suspensions nor were there any substantial changes in odour or ph
5987,suspensions of diclofenac sodium mg ml were quantitatively stable but difficult to prepare because of the enteric coating of the tablets
5988,therefore it is recommended that diclofenac powder be used for the preparation of suspensions
5989,for pediatric use palatability is a consideration and a masking agent should be added before administration
5990,an expiry date of up to days is suggested
5991,objective to observe the in vivo effect of combined iontophoresis and laurocapram pretreatment on transdermal delivery of diclofenac sodium gel
5992,methods diclofenac sodium gel was prepared using polyvinyl alcohol carboxymethylcellulose sodium and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose
5993,the diclofenac blood level in rabbits was measured in four groups passive diffusion laurocapram pretreatment iontophoresis current density controlled at ma cm and combined laurocapram pretreatment and iontophoresis
5994,rabbit stratum corneum of each of the four groups was examined using a scanning electron microscope
5995,results diclofenac blood concentration in the passive diffusion group was undetectable
5996,the diclofenac blood concentration area under the curve compared with time was mgr l ml h in the laurocapram pretreatment group mgr l ml h in the iontophoresis group and mgr l ml h in the combination group
5997,there was no detectable damage observed by scanning electron microscopyto the stratum corneum after iontophoresis or laurocapram pretreatment
5998,conclusion the combination of iontophoresis and laurocapram pretreatment appears to enhance transdermal delivery of diclofenac sodium gel wi thout significant skin damage
5999,this investigation tested the effect of anti inflammatory agents acting at different levels of the arachidonic acid cascade on leukocyte migration into the vessel wall
6000,an animal model of vasculitis was used in which leukocytes stimulate migration of smooth muscle cells from the media into the intima resulting in formation of intimal lesions
6001,in this model an endotoxin soaked thread is implanted in the adventitia along the ventral side of the rat femoral artery
6002,at days subendothelial and medial leukocyte accumulation occurs exclusively in the ventral half of the vessel
6003,at days intimal lesions composed primarily of smooth muscle cells are localized to the ventral half of the vessel
6004,treatment with neither the lipoxygenase inhibitor l nor the dual cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor bwc affected leukocyte migration into the vessel wall or subsequent lesion formation
6005,treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac sodium greatly reduced both leukocyte accumulation and lesion formation whereas leukocyte migration and lesion formation were nearly totally inhibited by treatment with dexamethasone
6006,thus it has been demonstrated that although leukocyte accumulation in the vessel wall stimulates intimal lesion formation pharmacologic inhibition of leukocyte accumulation prevents lesion formation
6007,diclofenac sodium was investigated in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis jra
6008,the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac in children aged was assessed
6009,seven patients were included in a single dose trial to determine plasma levels and renal elimination of diclofenac sodium

6012,maximum concentrations ranged from to micrograms ml and were found between and hours
6013,renal elimination of total diclofenac ranged from to of the oral dose in of the patients
6014,the youngest patient years had a lower elimination rate during the hours observed
6015,the values for children over years corresponded to the range measured in adults
6016,the pharmacokinetic study was followed by a placebo controlled study with diclofenac sodium and acetylsalicylic acid asa for weeks in hospitalized patients aged years
6017,the patients were randomly assigned to either ds mg kg day microcrystallized asa mg kg day or placebo matching diclofenac
6018,global evaluation of therapeutic efficacy showed improvement in of the patients in the diclofenac group in of the asa group and in of the placebo group
6019,a statistically significant difference between these groups was found p less than
6020,the sum of grades of joint tenderness decreased during the weeks in of patients in the diclofenac group in of the asa group and in of the placebo group
6021,abstract truncated at words
6022,the present study deals with the preparation of microspheres of diclofenac sodium using cross linked poly vinyl alcohol pva
6023,a central composite design consisting of a two level full factorial design superimposed on a star design was employed for developing the microspheres
6024,the pva to the drug ratio x and amount of glutaral dehyde cross linking agent x were chosen as the independent variables
6025,the time required for drug dissolution t in phosphate buffer ph was selected as the dependent variable
6026,an optimum polynomial equation was generated for the prediction of the response variable t
6027,based on the results of multiple linear regression analysis and f statistics it may be concluded that sustained action can be obtained when x and x are kept at high levels
6028,the xx interaction was found to be statistically significant
6029,a response surface plot is presented to show the effects of x and x on t
6030,the drug release pattern fit the higuchi model well
6031,a model was validated for accurate prediction of the drug dissolution profile with constraints on the percentage drug release in the first fifth and seventh hours

6041,to determine whether the use of topical diclofenac sodium diclofenac pre operatively improves the maintenance of per operative mydriasis in conjunction with irrigating solutions containing adrenaline
6042,sixty four consecutive patients undergoing phacoemulsification were randomised to receive either diclofenac or no diclofenac in conjunction with cyclopentolate and phenylephrine pre operatively
6043,they subsequently underwent routine phacoemulsification by one consultant surgeon
6044,irrigating solutions of balanced salt solution contained adrenaline
6045,pupil diameters were measured pre sclerostomy post phacoemulsification post irrigation aspiration and on day post operatively
6046,these were then compared by student s t test
6047,the two groups were statistically similar in age and sex
6048,the mean pre sclerostomy pupillary diameters were mm in both groups

6053,in an open comparative multicentre trial patients with arthritis of the large joints were treated with mg diclofenac in one single dose in the morning mg diclofenac given twice daily or mg naproxen administered twice a day
6054,it was noted that the length of history of pain was significantly longer in this naproxen group
6055,duration of the study was days
6056,clinical parameters showed that the best degree of improvement was obtained with the diclofenac mg twice daily dosage regime
6057,diclofenac in this study showed better tolerability than naproxen
6058,based on the principles of an elementary osmotic pump op op tablets were designed and evaluated with the aim to deliver diclofenac sodium ds in a controlled manner
6059,in vitro evaluation was done in various release media and kinetics was evaluated using the regression coefficient analysis
6060,effects of orifice size coating membrane type coating thickness static and stirred conditions and ph variation were studied
6061,in vivo evaluation was performed on six healthy human volunteers and various pharmacokinetic parameters c max t max auc mrt and relative bioavailability were calculated
6062,the results were compared with the performance of two commercial tablets of ds
6063,the drug release from op tablets was dependent on the type and thickness of the coating membrane but was independent of the orifice size and static and stirred conditions of the release medium
6064,the op tablets provided a prolonged and controlled ds release compared to commercial sustained release and conventional tablets of ds
6065,a unique patient with a painful transient erythematous blotchy eruption of the face neck and upper trunk is described
6066,administration of oral diclofenac sodium resulted in prompt control of the condition
6067,the possible relationship of this syndrome with erythermalgia is reviewed
6068,injection site abscess is an iatrogenic infection
6069,intramuscular im injection is a common route to administer medication
6070,microorganisms known to cause injection site abscess are staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas klebsiella escherichia coli commonly atypical mycobacteria clostridium species rarely
6071,gas gangrene is a necrotic infection of soft tissue with high mortality often necessitating amputation in order to control the infection
6072,here presenting a case of gas gangrene in a year old healthy male who developed a life threatening infection after im injection of sodium diclofenac
6073,prompt clinical diagnosis laboratory support and timely surgical intervention saved the patient s life
6074,to compare the efficacy and short term safety of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha ciba vision and of sodium chloride ophthalmic solution in the treatment of filamentary keratitis fk in patients with dry eye syndrome due to secondary sj gren s syndrome
6075,thirty two patients eyes with dry eye syndrome due to secondary sj gren syndrome were enrolled in a randomized study patients and authors were aware of which medication was being used
6076,all patients had fk
6077,sixteen patients were treated with sodium chloride drops and patients received diclofenac sodium eyedrops
6078,treatment regimen included instillation of drop times a day for days for both groups
6079,clinical assessment was performed once a week during the study period
6080,data on the efficacy and safety of the different therapeutic regimens were collected and compared
6081,both medications achieved disappearance of filaments at the end of the study
6082,treatment with diclofenac sodium revealed a significantly more rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms as compared with sodium chloride
6083,no significant adverse effects were observed in both groups
6084,diclofenac sodium may be an effective and safe topical therapy in patients with fk caused by secondary sj gren s disease
6085,to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the use of diclofenac sodium instead of meperidine for postcesarean section pain control
6086,a total of patients who had undergone cesarean section at the department of obstetrics and gynecology of gazi university hospital were prospectively randomised to receive one of two postoperative pain control regimens
6087,the first group of patients received intramuscular diclofenac sodium at a dose of x mg and additional breakthrough meperidine was given intramuscularly at mg dosages each time if necessary
6088,patients in the second group received only x mg meperidine
6089,twenty seven of the patients in the diclofenac group complained of unrelieved pain within the subsequent h postoperatively
6090,patients receiving diclofenac alone or a combination of diclofenac meperidine were less sedated and the time to the first passing of flatus was shorter than that in the patients treated with only meperidine
6091,diclofenac alone was safe and effective for the majority of the patients and it decreased the opioid requirements in the remaining patients
6092,sodium diclofenac sd release from dosage forms has been studied under different conditions
6093,however no dissolution method that is discriminatory enough to reflect slight changes in formulation or manufacturing process and which could be effectively correlated with the biological properties of the dosage form has been reported
6094,this study sought to develop three different formulae of sd containing matrix tablets and to determine the effect of agitation speed in its dissolution profiles
6095,f f and f formulations were developed using hypromellose and respectively for f f and f and other conventional excipients
6096,dissolution tests were carried out in phosphate buffer ph at degrees c using apparatus ii at or rpm
6097,dissolution efficiency de t and t were determined and plotted as functions of the variables agitation speed and hypromellose concentration
6098,regarding de f showed more sensitivity to variations in agitation speed than f and f
6099,increasing hypromellose concentration reduced de values independent of agitation speed
6100,analysis of t and t suggests that f is less sensitive to variations in agitation speed than f and f
6101,most discriminatory dissolution conditions were observed at rpm
6102,results suggest that the comparison of dissolution performance of sd matrix tablets should take into account polymer concentration and agitation conditions
6103,this study was undertaken to assess whether the analgesia conferred by diclofenac sodium in the post operative period following general surgery is enhanced by preoperative administration of the drug
6104,two groups of patients were studied
6105,group i patients received narcotic premedication and group ii patients received diclofenac sodium as premedication
6106,post operatively both groups were administered intramuscular diclofenac sodium hourly for hours
6107,pain scoring using visual analogue scale indicated a better pain relief in group ii patients
6108,in group i patients had a pain score less than whereas in group ii had a pain score less than figure
6109,pulmonary function tests were done hours after surgery and revealed improved values of all parameters in group ii patients
6110,this indicates a greater degree of analgesia in group ii patients
6111,preoperative administration of the drug reduces the initiation of pain in the periphery and decreases the inflammatory response after surgery
6112,nsaids do not have any central effect or any respiratory depression
6113,patients in our study were found to be awake cooperative and pain free
6114,the additional analgesia conferred by preoperative administration in conjunction with adequate postoperative therapy allows us to recommend diclofenac sodium as a sole analgesic for perioperative pain relief except in those patients with a bleeding diathesis
6115,a randomised double blind placebo controlled study was undertaken to assess the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac
6116,following major abdominal surgery and hours later patients received either placebo or diclofenac mg intramuscularly and their cumulative morphine requirements administered by a patient controlled system over hours were compared
6117,pain scores were also measured
6118,arterial blood gases and coagulation studies were assessed pre and postoperatively
6119,morphine consumption was significantly greater in the placebo group compared to mg p less than
6120,pain scores were significantly lower in the diclofenac group at hours but not thereafter
6121,arterial carbon dioxide was significantly increased in the control groups
6122,there was no significant change in platelet count within each group but a significant difference between the groups p less than
6123,in this work the effect of the encapsulation of diclofenac sodium within liposomes on the reduction of the myotoxicity after intramuscular administration in rats was studied
6124,diclofenac sodium was encapsulated in small unilamellar liposomes obtained from phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and alpha tocopherol mm and administered by intramuscular injection in the quadriceps femoral muscle of male wistar rats
6125,after a single dose of mg diclofenac formulations the local tissue damage was assessed by plasma creatine kinase cpk activity and histological analysis
6126,it was demonstrated that formulations containing free diclofenac produced a higher increase in cpk activity while those encapsulated in liposomes exhibited cpk activity similar to the control groups
6127,histopathological analysis of local muscle tissue performed on the third and seventh days following the injection showed intense cellular damage when free drug solution was used while encapsulation in liposome protected the tissue against the local tissue inflammation
6128,adsorption of sodium diclofenac was investigated in the presence of sucralfate a cytoprotective agent preventing gastropathy adverse effect of diclofenac
6129,evaluation of adsorption was performed by means of a static method in vitro taking into account ph of the environment temperature concentration of the investigated agents and the form of sucralfate
6130,findings obtained prove that sodium diclofenac is adsorbed on sucralfate in all investigated ph ranges and the capability of sucralfate binding depends on its form temperature and environmental ph
6131,the highest binding was observed at ph in the presence of sucralfate which at this ph has the form of a suspension while the lowest at ph in the presence of sucralfate in the form of paste
6132,low values of adsorption temperature of diclofenac as well as the relationship between the level of its adsorption and environmental ph are the dominating factors pointing to the physical and exothermic adsorption
6133,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose combination of diclofenac sodium and acetaminophen injection a study was carried out in patients suffering from acute pain
6134,thirty eight adult patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery received ml injection of diclofenac mg and acetaminophen mg per ml by deep intramuscular route hourly for doses
6135,the pain assessment was made on a mm visual analogue scale vas onset of action extent of pain relief and maximum fall in vas score after the first dose was assessed
6136,injection pentazocine lactate was administered as rescue medication in case of uncontrolled pain
6137,at baseline the pain score on vas was which at the end of hour was found to be there was a statistically significant p anova reduction in mean pain score starting from minutes after administration of first dose and extending up to the end of study period
6138,complete relief was seen in patients and the mean time for complete relief was minutes after the first dose
6139,maximum fall and maximum percentage fall in vas score during the study period was mm and respectively on a mm vas and the time for achieving maximum fall was minutes after the first dose of study medication
6140,the results of this study suggest that fixed dose combination of diclofenac and acetaminophen is effective and safe for management of postoperative pain in orthopaedic surgery
6141,diclofenac sodium dcf is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is widely used as an analgesic and anti inflammatory agent
6142,herein we found that dcf could relax high k
6143,although the adverse effects of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids on the upper gastrointestinal tract have been well characterized those specific to the lower gastrointestinal tract are less clear as only a limited number of articles and case reports exist in the literature
6144,we describe a case of a year old woman who presented to the emergency department due to sudden onset abdominal distension and pain
6145,notably she reported using intramuscular diclofenac sodium twice daily for days after knee joint replacement surgery
6146,the patient denied any other coexisting diseases
6147,as a subsequent x ray and computed tomography ct scan showed free air in the abdomen an exploratory laparotomy was performed revealing four free perforations in the terminal ileum
6148,findings on microscopic analysis were non specific
6149,we report a unique case of multiple ileal perforations due to regular diclofenac sodium injections and contend that ileal perforation can be considered as a source for pneumoperitoneum with concomitant peritonitis in patients with a history of nsaid use if other possibilities are excluded
6150,the pegylated derivatives of rosin pd and pd synthesized and characterized earlier nande et al were investigated as potential materials for sustained release microsphere prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method using diclofenac sodium dcs as model drug
6151,all the microspheres exhibited smooth surfaces intercepted by pores their sizes d ranged between microm
6152,the entrapment efficiency of the microspheres increased proportionally with derivative concentration
6153,presence of solvent like isopropyl alcohol or dichloromethane rendered the microspheres with large sizes but with reduced drug entrapment
6154,microspheres with small size were obtained at an optimum viscosity of liquid paraffin any change lead to increase in the particle size
6155,magnesium stearate was found to be most suitable detackifier in the present system
6156,the drug release was directly related to the particle size small sized microspheres released drug at a faster rate
6157,the dissolution data complied with higuchi equation while the mechanism of drug release was fickian diffusion n approximately
6158,controlled inhibition of edema as tested by hind paw edema method was observed for h when the microspheres were administered intraperitoneally
6159,the present study found the derivatives as promising materials for preparing microspheres for sustained delivery of dcs
6160,diclofenac sodium a non steroidal anti inflammatory agent was studied for its influence on the locomotion of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils pmn in an attempt to define the mechanism governing the drug s anti inflammatory properties
6161,pmn locomotion was measured by the agarose technique under two conditions of stimulation of cell migration in the presence of a gradient of stimuli chemotaxis and in the presence of various amounts of stimuli incorporated in the gel chemokinesis
6162,at concentrations below micrograms ml diclofenac in the gel reduced in a dose dependent manner the directed locomotion of pmn induced by a gradient of ca activated serum peptide n formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine fmlp or klebsiella pneumoniae culture supernatant kpcs
6163,diclofenac also inhibited the random locomotion of unstimulated pmn as well as the pmn chemokinetic activity induced by various amounts of fmlp or activated serum
6164,inhibition of pmn locomotion by diclofenac decreased when the concentration of the stimulant was raised this inhibition was inversely related to the concentration of heat inactivated fetal calf serum in the medium
6165,the directed locomotion and chemokinesis of pmn induced by fmlp were also reduced in pmn preincubated with diclofenac before migration suggesting a direct cellular effect of diclofenac
6166,on the other hand diclofenac did not affect the changes in shape induced in floating pmn by fmlp or activated serum
6167,the observation that diclofenac did not alter the ingestion rate of bacteria by pmn indicates that this drug is not cytotoxic for pmn
6168,consequently diclofenac reduces pmn locomotion by interfering with the pmn chemokinetic activity
6169,diclofenac is an anti inflammatory drug possessing the original property of acting as a negative chemokinetic agent for migration of both stimulated and unstimulated pmn
6170,it should therefore be a useful tool for analyzing the elements controlling pmn locomotion speed
6171,to determine whether the administration of antiinflammatory drugs interferes with experimental pleurodesis induced by silver nitrate or talc
6172,two groups of white new zealand rabbits were scheduled to receive an intrapleural injection of silver nitrate or mg kg of talc
6173,each group was further classified into three subgroups animals each which received the following subgroup the sclerosing agent only subgroup the sclerosing agent plus mg kg of methylprednisolone and subgroup the sclerosing agent plus mg kg of diclofenac sodium
6174,the antiinflammatory agents were administered im h before the sclerosing agent and daily during the first week followed by once weekly injections until death at days
6175,at this time the pleural cavity was macroscopically evaluated and samples of pleura and lungs were collected for further microscopic examination
6176,the degree of pleural adhesions was higher after silver nitrate administration p
6177,no reduction in the adhesions was observed after administering antiinflammatory drugs to this group p
6178,conversely the adhesion score was significantly reduced after administration of both prednisolone p and diclofenac p to the animals that received talc
6179,administration of the antiinflammatory agents did not influence microscopic pleural or lung changes induced by silver nitrate or talc
6180,these results show that the sustained systemic administration of antiinflammatory agents steroidal or nonsteroidal reduces the degree of pleural adhesions in animals with talc induced pleurodesis but does not affect silver nitrate induced pleurodesis
6181,extrapolation of these results to humans suggests that the use of antiinflammatory drugs should be avoided in patients with talc induced pleurodesis and that appropriate clinical studies with silver nitrate should be conducted in patients chronically treated with these antiinflammatory agents
6182,a double blind controlled between patient trial was carried out in patients with painful stiff shoulder to compare the effect of treatment with either mg diclofenac sodium or mg ibuprofen given times daily for weeks
6183,the results of assessments made before and after treatment showed that although both drugs produced some improvement no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of pain relief or the range of movement were evident
6184,the incidence of side effects was also similar
6185,in a behavioural study the effects of intravenous diclofenac in a range of doses were determined by measuring vocalization thresholds to paw pressure in normal and freund s adjuvant induced arthritic rats
6186,in normal rats and mg kg diclofenac produced an increase in vocalization thresholds mean threshold values were respectively per cent and per cent of the control at min n for each group no effect resulting with mg kg
6187,in arthritic rats and mg kg diclofenac induced a clear analgesic effect mean threshold values being per cent per cent and per cent respectively of the control at min n for each group no effect being observed with mg kg
6188,an electrophysiological study performed on arthritic rats considered the effect of mg kg diclofenac upon the neuronal ventrobasal thalamic responses induced by mode rate stimulation of an inflamed joint
6189,the responses were depressed by about per cent minutes after the injection
6190,these results show that diclofenac displays a direct effect on pain processing this effect is more potent in arthritic rats than in normal rats
6191,microspheres containing diclofenac sodium ds were prepared using carboxymethylcellulose cmc as the main support material w v and aluminum chloride as the crosslinker
6192,drug to polymer ratios of and were used to obtain a range of microspheres
6193,the microspheres were then coated with an enteric coating material eudragit s efficiency yield value particle sizes an in vitro dissolution behaviour were investigated
6194,the surface of the enteric coated microspheres seemed to be all covered with eudragit s from scanning electron microscopy observation
6195,it was also observed that increasing the cmc concentration led to an increase in the encapsulation efficiency yield value and particle size and decreased the release rate
6196,eudragit s coating did not significantly alter the size but the release rate was significantly lower even when the lower concentration solution was used
6197,the aim of this study was to characterize the thermal stability of diclofenac sodium both alone and in the inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin in the solid state by determination of the number of the products of its decomposition which were identified by gc ms the molar ratio of diclofenac sodium in the inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin was the decomposition of diclofenac sodium both alone and in inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin occurred according to the first order reaction
6198,the hplc of the samples thermostated at degrees c gave five products of decomposition which were identified by gc ms diclofenac sodium in the inclusion complex with beta cyclodextrin was more thermally stable
6199,thermal decomposition of diclofenac sodium leads to formation of five products of which chloro h acridinone had not been reported previously in the literature
6200,the aim of the study was to compare treatment with diclofenac sodium voltaren x mg to occlusal splint therapy in a randomized single blind controlled trial of patients with a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint tmj osteoarthritis oa in accordance with research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders
6201,patients with general joint disorders or restrictions against medication with non steroidal anti inflammatory drug were not included
6202,twenty seven females and two males aged years included answered a standardized questionnaire and were clinically examined and they underwent tmj tomography
6203,the treatment was randomized to either splint n or diclofenac n
6204,the temperatures over the tmjs were determined
6205,the patients were re examined week month and months after the start of treatment
6206,a year follow up was carried out using questionnaires
6207,after week of treatment with diclofenac significant reductions of pain and discomfort tmj tenderness and joint pain on jaw movements were noted
6208,the splint therapy gave a significant reduction of reported symptoms after month of treatment
6209,both treatments gave few adverse effects and were on an equal level
6210,estimation of the degree of inflammation by measuring the surface temperature over the tmj was not reliable
6211,structural changes of the symptomatic tmjs were radiographically found in the contralateral symptom free tmj had changes in
6212,there was a discrepancy between the clinical and the radiographical findings
6213,diclofenac gave a more rapid improvement but both treatments gave a significant reduction of symptoms of tmj oa within months which remained at the one year follow up
6214,the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren on spermatogenesis in infertile oligospermic patients has been studied
6215,diclofenac sodium was given orally at a daily dose of mg for days
6216,seminal fluid parameters were evaluated
6217,group ii with high levels of seminal prostaglandin showed a statistically significant increase in the number and motility of spermatozoa p less than whilst no significant variations were observed in patients of group i with normal values of seminal prostaglandin
6218,diclofenac sodium was administered as mg tablets to four healthy male volunteers in a two way randomized crossover study in which volunteers were either fasted or were given a standard breakfast immediately prior to dosing
6219,blood samples were obtained upto hours period and drug concentration were determined by hplc method
6220,besides a significantly delayed at p peak in fed state an increase in absorption rate constant was observed as the only significant at p effect of food on biopharmaceutic characteristic of diclofenac sodium
6221,however the intrinsic absorption of diclofenac sodium is also fast and it is not being the rate limiting factor in the bioavailability of diclofenac sodium its decrease upto about minutes hr from minutes hr produces a null difference as the net effect on bioavailability particularly when the drug is to be used in multiple dosage regimen
6222,effect was studied of quercetin on experimentally induced injuries of the gastric mucosa
6223,the animals were divided into groups in group i animals the placebo solution of diclofenac sodium was administered in group ii animals the solution of diclofenac sodium was administered in a dose of mg kg intragastrally with the aid of a specific probe group iii animals were given quercetin perorally mg kg for up to three days with diclofenac sodium to follow group iv animals treatable group received the same dose of quercetin for up to three days after a single administration of diclofenac sodium
6224,at the end of the experiment the animals died from the overdosage of ether
6225,the peoral use of quercetin before and after administration of diclofenac sodium has been shown to be associated with fewer ulcers in test animals which fact suggests to us a protective effect of quercetin on their gastric mucosa
6226,electrospinning is a method utilized to produce nano scale fibers for tissue engineering applications
6227,a variety of cells are attracted by nano scale surfaces and structures probably due to the similarity of their natural environment scale
6228,in this study diclofenac sodium ds releasing nanofibers were manufactured via electrospinning process
6229,poly epsilon capro d l lactide was dissolved into acetic acid to form a w v solution
6230,w w of ds was then added into the polymer solution and stirred homogenously
6231,about g of polymer drug solution was spun onto the collector under electrostatic conditions
6232,the distance between needle tip and sample collector was arranged to cm and applied electric field was kv cm
6233,release rate of ds was measured by using uv vis spectrophotometer
6234,resulted highly porous nanofiber scaffold was about mm thick and the diameter of nanofibers was approximately nm
6235,structure included in also spheres with approximately diameter of microm
6236,about of ds was released during the first hours and after that the release decreased to almost zero value
6237,after days release rate increased
6238,this study revealed that manufacturing of highly porous ds releasing nanoscaffold by electrospinning process is feasible
6239,having fast ds release rate nanofibrous scaffold made of poly epsilon capro d l lactide can be of benefit for applications where immediate control of tissue reaction is needed
6240,dissolution behavior of diclofenac sodium ds from wax matrix granules wmgs prepared using a twin screw compounding extruder is closely related to swelling ability and solubility of the rate controlling agent employed
6241,a swellable and soluble hydroxypropyl cellulose hpc sl generates both an expansion of pores inside wmgs and a structural change observed as cracking on the surface of wmgs
6242,these changes are confirmed by mercury porosimetry
6243,release of ds was increased with an increase in the amount of hpc sl in wmgs but only of ds was released from wmgs containing w w nacl at the h point of the dissolution
6244,further no cracking was observed on the surface of nacl containing wmgs
6245,a linear relationship between mean dissolution time mdt of ds for wmgs containing different types of hpc hpc sl m and h and swelling abilities suggests that release of ds could be directly controlled by swelling of hpcs
6246,in addition to this result an application of the exponential model mt m infinity kt n introduced by ritger and peppas j controlled release to ds release indicates that case ii release plays a critical role in hpc sl containing wmgs and fickian release is predominant in nacl containing wmgs since the values of n of wmgs containing w w nacl and w w hpc sl are and respectively
6247,these results suggest that proper selection of rate controlling agents based on their physicochemical properties such as swelling ability and solubility is important in designing wmgs with desired dissolution profiles
6248,this study focused on the properties of diclofenac sodium dna alginate alg microspheres and tabletted dna alg microspheres using different polymers as additives
6249,dna alginate microspheres were prepared by the emulsification method and different polymers such as eudragit eud ne d eudragit eud rs d and aquacoat which were incorporated into alg gel to control the release rate of drug
6250,the release properties of dna alg microspheres were affected by the size drug load of microspheres and also by the incorporated polymers ph and ionic strength of dissolution medium
6251,tabletting of alg microspheres using carrageenan carr alg pectin nacmc tragacanth trgh and hpmc as additives in a ratio produced tablets with good physical properties and also better controlled release of dna
6252,dissolution studies were carried out in ph phosphate buffer and phosphate buffers whose ph values were gradually changed from ph to the rank order of dna release from tablets was carr alg pectin nacmc trgh hpmc which relates to the viscosity and swelling properties of polymers
6253,the drug release was very slow from trgh and hpmc based tablets but addition of carr or alg in different ratios could adjust the release rate of drug
6254,we tested the effect of topical diclofenac sodium on corneal sensitivity in the human eye
6255,corneal sensitivity was measured in ten adult subjects with the cochet bonnet esthesiometer before and immediately after applying one drop of diclofenac sodium in one eye and one drop of diclofenac vehicle in the other eye
6256,application was repeated every five minutes for minutes then no more drops were applied and corneal sensitivity was measured every minutes until sensitivity measurements returned to baseline levels
6257,diclofenac sodium decreased corneal sensitivity significantly p in all ten subjects compared with eyes treated with the vehicle
6258,the effect of diclofenac sodium increased as additional drops were administered
6259,after the drug instillation was stopped corneal sensitivity returned to baseline measurements within less than an hour in all the subjects
6260,diclofenac sodium substantially lowers sensitivity in normal unoperated on human corneas the vehicle has no measurable effect on sensitivity
6261,in a double blind study diclofenac sodium voltaren mg two or three times a day was compared with placebo in patients with pain localized to the temporomandibular joint tmj
6262,the patients were allocated into two equally large groups
6263,a visual analog scale was used to estimate the pretreatment degree of pain
6264,the treatment effect was assessed as the frequency of joint and muscle pain and by the patients own evaluation of improvement
6265,the change in the clinical condition was assessed by tenderness to palpation of the tmj and masticatory muscles and by mandibular mobility
6266,the frequency of tmj pain showed a greater reduction in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group and there was a significant reduction of daily tmj pain in the diclofenac group
6267,the diclofenac group also showed a significant decrease in tenderness to palpation of the masticatory muscles in comparison with the placebo group
6268,the patients with short duration of pain showed the best response to diclofenac
6269,there was no evidence in this study to prove that diclofenac should be used as a primary treatment of tmj pain but it could be used as a complement to other treatments of acute tmj pain
6270,the spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of diclofenac was carried out by liquid liquid extraction using acridine yellow with a flow system
6271,the determination of diclofenac sodium in the range of micrograms ml was possible with a sampling frequency of samples h
6272,the method was satisfactorily applied to the determination of diclofenac in pharmaceutical preparations
6273,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug that inhibits filamentation in candida albicans
6274,here we examined the effect of diclofenac sodium on hypha formation in c albicans
6275,the c albicans cells were treated with various concentrations of diclofenac sodium and microg ml and incubated at degrees c for h
6276,the characteristics of hypha formation were then assessed microscopically in both liquid and solid media
6277,the results indicated that the effect of diclofenac sodium was dependent on the concentration of this compound and preincubation with microg ml diclofenac sodium completely inhibited hypha formation in both liquid and solid media
6278,rt qpcr analysis of rna extracted from c albicans indicated that the levels of expression of agglutinin like sequence als ras efg mrna which are regulated by the camp efg pathway in c albicans and three hypha specific genes als ece and hwp were decreased in diclofenac sodium treated cells compared to the levels in controls
6279,our results also demonstrated that diclofenac sodium possesses potent anti yeast hypha transition activity in vitro and it could be useful in combined therapy with conventional antifungal agents in the management of treatment of candida albicans infections
6280,although diclofenac sodium voltaren is one of the most frequently prescribed non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids worldwide for the treatment of inflammation and pain data on the ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues due to its chronic exposure are limited
6281,therefore the present study was designed to identify the ultrastructural renal alterations induced by diclofenac sodium
6282,the experiment was conducted at the animal house of the department of zoology college of science king saud university riyadh kingdom of saudi arabia during the period from april to june a total of male rabbits were exposed to intraperitoneal injection with a daily dose of diclofenac sodium mg kg body weight for days to investigate the resultant ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues
6283,in comparison with the respective control rabbits chronic exposure to therapeutic doses of diclofenac sodium produced significant ultrastructural renal alterations which involved swelling and cristolysis of the mitochondria marked dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum detachment of ribosomes increased lysosomal structures nuclear chromatin condensation in the tubular cells thickening of the glomerular basement membranes distention of glomerular capillaries which showed lodgment of neutrophils mesangial and endothelial cell proliferation in the glomeruli swelling and fusion of the glomerular podocytes foot processes with focal obliteration of the filtration slits
6284,the obtained results indicate that chronic exposure to diclofenac sodium produces significant ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues
6285,we formulated a solid in oil nanosuspension sons as a novel transdermal delivery carrier for diclofenac sodium dfna
6286,the basic transdermal characteristics of the sons were evaluated using a yucatan micropig ymp skin model
6287,dfna sucrose erucate i e
6288,surfactant complexes were prepared via the formation of a water in oil emulsion
6289,the complexes were suspended in isopropyl myristate ipm to form a sons
6290,the basic transdermal characteristics of the sons were examined using full thickness ymp dorsal skin in a franz type diffusion cell
6291,dfna powder suspended in ipm without complex formation was used as a control
6292,the effect of the weight ratio of surfactant to dfna on dfna penetration of the skin was evaluated
6293,dfna was successfully dispersed into ipm as a nanosized suspension via complex formation with sucrose erucate
6294,the resultant sons increased the permeability flux of dfna across the ymp skin by up to fold compared with the control
6295,the size of the sons depended on the weight ratio of the surfactant to dfna
6296,the optimal weight ratio for the highest dfna permeation was at which point the mean diameter of the sons was nm
6297,the sons formulation can enhance the percutaneous absorption of dfna
6298,the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren and of prostaglandin e pge on spermatogenesis in mature dogs has been studied
6299,diclofenac sodium at mg kg was given subcutaneously once a day for days
6300,the testes were biopsied every days and spermatogenesis was quantified showing a marked and statistically significant increase p less than
6301,administration of pge in doses of mg kg subcutaneously once a day for days produced a marked and statistically significant decrease in spermatogenesis p less than and an increase in the numbers of exfoliated immature germ cells in the seminiferous tubule lumens
6302,this study explored the application of chitosan alginate ca and chitosan pectin cp complex films as drug release regulator for the preparation of multiunit controlled release diclofenac sodium capsules
6303,pellets containing drug and microcrystalline cellulose in a ratio of were prepared in a fluidized rotary granulator
6304,the pellets were coated with ca cp sodium alginate pectin and chitosan solutions
6305,the pellets equivalent to mg drug were filled into capsules
6306,after h of dissolution test in acidic medium the amount of the drug released from any preparation was negligible
6307,the pellets were further subject to ph phosphate buffer more than drug release at h was observed with the uncoated pellets and those coated with sodium alginate pectin or chitosan
6308,both ca and cp coated pellets exhibited drug release profiles similar to that of voltaren sr
6309,it was found that approximately and of the drug were released at and h respectively
6310,both differential thermal analysis dta and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses revealed complex formation between chitosan and these anionic polymers
6311,it could be concluded that ca and cp complex film could be easily applied to diclofenac sodium pellets to control the release of the drug
6312,the present work reports on a new pharmaceutical formulation for oral delivery of diclofenac sodium dfna a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid
6313,although dfna itself is water soluble at neutral ph it was readily suspended in soybean oil via complex formation with an edible lipophilic surfactant and a matrix protein
6314,the resulting solid in oil s o suspension containing stably encapsulated dfna in an oil phase markedly reduced the risks for gastrointestinal ulcers upon oral administration even at the ld level in rats ca
6316,in addition plasma concentration of dfna upon administration of an s o suspension was comparable with that of the aqueous counterpart at the same dfna dose
6317,these results indicate the potential use of s o suspensions as novel oil based pharmaceutical formulations for oral delivery of water soluble drugs without causing severe mucitis
6318,the effect of diclofenac sodium was investigated on haemodynamics haematologic and blood glucose values as well as the release of eicosanoids tumor necrosis factor tnf and platelet activating factor paf in anaesthetized pigs receiving micrograms kg escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide lps over min into the superior mesenteric artery
6319,the animals were observed for an additional period of h after the termination of lps infusion
6320,of the animals infused with lps and not treated with diclofenac sodium died within min after the commencement of lps infusion non survivors while the other survived the experimental period of h though in a shock state survivors
6321,no alterations were observed in plasma concentrations of paf or eicosanoids txb keto pgf alpha and ltb but a marked increase was detected in tnf release in the non survivors
6322,a significant though transient increase in concentrations of paf tnf and eicosanoids studied characterized the survivors
6323,another group of lps infused pigs was treated with diclofenac sodium mg kg i v
6324,bolus min before the start of lps infusion followed by a continuous infusion of mg kg h mg kg h
6325,this treatment prevented death and shock despite the high concentrations of tnf and paf
6326,concentrations of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes products were reduced
6327,these data indicated that the beneficial effect of diclofenac sodium in lps induced shock may be related to the reduced production of eicosanoids
6328,eyelid dermatitis and or periocular dermatitis ed pd is commonly seen in a variety of skin diseases such as seborrheic dermatitis atopic dermatitis and psoriasis but is most often associated with allergic contact dermatitis acd
6329,here a case of acd in an year old man is described he used diclofenac sodium eye drops and exhibited pruritic erythema on the eyelids
6330,patch test for diclofenac sodium eye drops was positive
6331,further patch tests revealed a positive reaction to diclofenac sodium monosodium dichlorophenylamino phenylacetate which was the main component in the eye drop medicine
6332,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and is frequently used in everyday oral medications topical ointments gel agents and eye drops
6333,case reports on acd caused by diclofenac sodium eye drops are extremely rare
6334,nevertheless it is necessary to consider acd due to diclofenac sodium when a patient with ed pd has a history of use of diclofenac sodium eye drops
6335,post laparoscopy pain can increase recovery time and delay patient discharge
6336,while previous studies have focused on the problems of nausea and vomiting the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of diclofenac a non steroidal antiinflammatory drug in the treatment of post laparoscopy pain
6337,diclofenac mg or placebo was administered pr randomly and double blind prior to induction of anaesthesia to women
6338,pain intensity was assessed by the patient using a visual analogue scale and hr after surgery
6339,postoperative analgesic requirements and side effects were also studied
6340,diclofenac resulted in better pain relief at hr vs p and reduced the number of patients who needed additional postoperative analgesics vs p
6341,there was no difference in the incidence of side effects
6342,these data suggest that diclofenac reduces post laparoscopy pain and postoperative analgesic requirements
6343,the production of spheres loaded with diclofenac sodium by the cross linking technique was achieved
6344,the hydrophilic polymer sodium carboxymethylcellulose na cmc which gels in the presence of a cross linking agent aluminum chloride alcl was used as a matrix forming agent for the bead production
6345,to obtain a regular and uniform rate of drug release the produced beads were coated with sodium alginate to increase the pathway of the diffused medium
6346,two processing variables were studied the flocculating agent concentration and w v and different coating times and min
6347,the results show that the higher concentrations of aluminum chloride and w v produced more uniform and rounded beads than that prepared using w v salt
6348,the particle size of the core beads decreased insignificantly p as the flocculating agent concentration increased
6349,the coating time did not affect the particle size of the coated beads within the same concentration of aluminum chloride
6350,the dissolution studies showed that the release rate of diclofenac sodium from the core beads increased with the increase of alcl concentration and that the rate of drug release was markedly reduced after the coating of the core beads with na alginate
6351,the results also show a linear relationship for drug release over a h period from the core beads where it showed a longer straight line relationship h for the coated beads
6352,the coating of the al cmc beads prepared using w v alcl ho with w v aqueous solution of na alginate resulted in a significant p sustaining action of the al cmc beads as indicated by the shift in tmax from to h and the prolongation of the mrt from to h the cmax increased significantly from to micrograms ml while the auc increased insignificantly p from to micrograms h ml resulting in a relative bioavailability of relative to al cmc beads
6353,three different ratios of alginic acid chitosan matrices of ratios and respectively were crosslinked in their dry state using citric acid ca sodium hypophosphite shp at different conditions controlling the crosslinking process such as citric acid concentration citric acid sodium hypophosphite molar ratio as well as time and temperature of reaction
6354,results indicate that such matrices were crosslinked efficiently on curing at c for min in presence of ca shp ratio and the citric acid concentration of based on the weight of any matrices
6355,the crosslinked matrices were characterized by investigating their swelling properties ft ir and thermalgravimetric analysis
6356,furthermore such crosslinked matrices were tested as drug release for sodium diclofenac
6357,two hundred consecutive patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic in reducing patient discomfort after cataract surgery
6358,other factors evaluated were the effect of preoperative flurbiprofen ocufen in preventing intraoperative miosis and on postoperative discomfort and the effect of incision size and intraocular carbachol miostat on postoperative comfort
6359,diclofenac significantly reduced discomfort during the first hours after surgery but not two to three days postoperatively although there was a trend toward reduction
6360,flurbiprofen given preoperatively did not affect postoperative discomfort
6361,it also did not affect pupil size at the start of surgery but did reduce intraoperative miosis
6362,incision size mm versus mm had no effect on discomfort
6363,miostat did not affect discomfort although there was a trend toward more discomfort
6364,the results indicate that topical diclofenac given immediately after cataract surgery significantly reduces discomfort during the first postoperative hours
6365,the effect of diclofenac sodium ds on the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans gag was studied in rabbits during the development of osteoarthritis of the knee induced by immobilization
6366,contents of hexosamines uronic acid and sulphate derived s radioactivity in separated gags were determined
6367,ds was given to immobilized rabbits for days at a dose of mg kg through a stomach tube
6368,the controls consisted of immobilized rabbits without medication and of non immobilized rabbits of which received ds for days
6369,ds did not inhibit in vivo metabolism of sulphated gags according to measurements of s sulphate incorporation
6370,healthy rabbits given ds showed only marginal changes of gag content in joint tissues
6371,ds did not prevent the loss of gag from the weight bearing cartilages of the immobilized knees but caused a further loss of chondroitin sulphates accompanied by an increased amount of hyaluronic acid in the tissues
6372,ds prevented accumulation of the gags which normally occurs during development of osteoarthritis in tissues of the tibial margin and in collateral ligaments
6373,the findings indicate that the effect of ds on the gag metabolism in connective tissues is somewhat different from that with other non steroidal anti inflammatory agents
6374,alginate chitosan particles were prepared by ionic gelation ca and al for the sodium diclofenac release
6375,the systems were characterized by electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry
6376,the ability to release the active substance was examined as a function of some technological parameters and ph of dissolution medium
6377,the release of sodium diclofenac is prevented at acidic ph while is complete in a few minutes when ph is raised up to and the alginate chitosan ratio and the nature of the gelifying cation allow a control of the release rate of the drug
6378,the release mechanism was briefly discussed
6379,in attempts to design delayed release tablets of diclofenac sodium seven experimental batches were produced
6380,the influence of super disintegrant croscarmellose sodium ccs the granulation process and the thickness of eudragit l coating film were evaluated
6381,the values of dissolution efficiency and the similarity factor were used to compare the dissolution profiles of each experimental batch and the reference voltaren
6382,both methods appear to be applicable and useful in comparing dissolution profiles
6383,based on such values four batches were considered similar when contrasted with the reference
6384,the results suggest an optimal relationship between the amount of ccs and the thickness of the coating film which provides appropriate dissolution rate of diclofenac sodium from the dosage forms
6385,the intercalation reaction of diclofenac sodium dfs with layered inorganic compounds gamma titanium phosphate gamma tip proton type titanium oxide h tio and sodium type synthetic mica na tsm was examined on
6386,the direct reaction of dfs in ethanol water mixed solvent resulted in the large amount accommodation of dfs
6387,the amount of intercalated dfs was the order of gamma tip h tio na tsm corresponding to the order of acidity
6388,the intercalation using phospholiopids was also examined to assist the intercalation reaction
6389,however the amount of intercalated dfs was rather small in comparison with those in the direct reaction
6390,dfs accommodated in gamma tip dissolved into neutral and basic buffer solution stoichiometry while scarcely dissolved in the acidic solution
6391,the mechanism of the intercalation and reverse dissolution was successfully accounted according to the ion exchange mechanism between na in dfs and h in gamma tip
6392,the dissolution from tablet of dfs gamma tip intercalation compound was examined by using a disintegrator
6393,it was found that the dissolution rate appropriately controlled by mixing the disintegrator
6394,the present results suggested the different possibilities in the clinical field to use layered inorganic compounds such as drug delivery system dds
6395,urea formaldehyde uf polymerized in situ in aqueous media is a rigid polymer that can be used in the controlled release of bioactive molecules
6396,during the process of polymerization liquid neem seed oil nso was encapsulated at three different loadings which was then replaced by diclofenac sodium ds the presence of which was confirmed by ftir spectra
6397,the nanocapsules thus prepared were evaluated for percentage loading of the drug particle size and release characteristics
6398,thermal analysis and x ray data were obtained to understand the physical nature of the encapsulated drug
6399,the surface characteristics of the nanocapsules were studied using a scanning electron microscope
6400,particles in the size range around nm were obtained
6401,the percentage loading efficiency of nso was approximately whereas for ds the loading efficiency was only
6402,complete release of the drug from the matrices occurred in h whereas at h only of the drug was released
6403,a new antirheumatic non steroid drug sodium diclofenac voltaren geigy has been experimented in patients aged between and hospitalized at the iind medical division of enna hospital
6404,the patients were divided into three groups suffering from rheumatoid arthritis scapulohumeral periarthritis uratic arthritis and rheumatic carditis in active phase
6405,in almost all treated cases the drug proved to have good therapeutic effectiveness demonstrated by complete remission or attenuation of clinical symptomatology and by the return to normal or reduction in the various modified biohumoral indices in all cases treated good tolerance absolute lack of side effects and toxicity
6406,special attention has been paid to study of possible changes to gastric mucosa by means of careful evaluation of endoscopic and histological findings
6407,intravenous diclofenac sodium was evaluated in a double blind randomised trial relative to intramuscular diclofenac intravenous fentanyl and intramuscular placebo in patients undergoing extraction of impacted lower third molar teeth
6408,the test drug was administered before operation in an attempt to alleviate postoperative pain
6409,a cm visual analogue scale was used to assess pain at minutes and one day after surgery if the patients stayed overnight
6410,patients who received intravenous diclofenac had significantly less pain than the other groups minutes after operation
6411,they also had significantly less pain one day after surgery than the placebo or opioid groups but not less than the intramuscular diclofenac group
6412,capillary bleeding time in comparison with placebo was significantly prolonged after the use of intramuscular diclofenac and a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the intravenous diclofenac group
6413,no problems were encountered with excessive bleeding in any group
6414,the efficacy of diclofenac sodium a potent prostaglandin inhibitor in patients with acute migraine attacks in a double blind placebo controlled study involving migraine patients
6415,forty six patients with acute migraine attacks were treated with intramuscular injection of mg diclofenac sodium and another group of forty patients with intramuscular injection of paracetamol
6416,partial or complete relief of pain and other symptoms of acute migraine attack was achieved within minutes after treatment in the diclofenac sodium group and within minutes in the paracetamol group
6417,complete relief of attack was achieved within minutes after diclofenac sodium in patients compared to patients of the paracetamol group p less than
6418,five of the patients treated with diclofenac sodium needed a second injection for complete relief of pain during the to hour follow up period
6419,side effects were rare and minimal
6420,in conclusion diclofenac sodium administered intramuscularly is a very effective drug in treating acute migraine attacks
6421,the objective of this work was to investigate the effect of thermal treating on the release rate of diclofenac sodium from eudragit rs and eudragit rl matrices
6422,eudragit rs and rl are nonswelling polymers that have a low glass transition tg temperature
6423,the matrices were thermally treated at different temperatures and degrees c for different periods of times and h
6424,the results showed that thermal treating at temperatures less than the tg of the polymer has no effect on the release of the drug whereas heat treating at temperatures higher than the tg decreases the release rate of diclofenac sodium from matrices
6425,it was shown that the duration of heat treatment was also an important factor in controlling the release rate of diclofenac sodium from eudragit matrices
6426,the results showed that an increase in the duration of heat treatment from h to h resulted in a reduction in the release rate of the drug
6427,scanning electron microscopy of the cross section of the tablet before and after heat treating showed that the tablets were deformed and fused into a continuous and homogeneous structure after heat treating
6428,thermally treated tablets demonstrated fewer surface defects than did nonthermally treated tablets
6429,these structural changes in the tablet compacts resulted in a matrix structure that decreased the release rate of the diclofenac sodium from eudragit matrices
6430,assay of diclofenac sodium and codeine phosphate in tablet is reported in this paper
6431,the calibration curves were linear over the range of microg ml of diclofenac sodium and over the range of microg ml of codeine phosphate
6432,the average recoveries and relative standard deviations of diclofenac sodium and codeine phosphate were and respectively
6433,the method is simple and rapid and the results are satisfactory
6434,sodium diclofenac dcf cas is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug whose activity is mainly due to an inhibitory effect on the synthesis of the prostaglandins
6435,at present a tendency towards its topical use in the treatment of the inflammatory state of the anterior segment of the eye as an alternative to the steroid drugs is observed
6436,the pharmacokinetics of dcf was studied in rabbits by assessing the ocular and systemic absorption of dcf after administering dcf eye drops
6437,the chromatographic methods available were not sensitive enough to quantify the extremely low drug concentrations which appeared in the biological fluids after ocular treatment
6438,for this reason the concentrations of dcf in plasma and aqueous humor were evaluated by a coupled liquid chromatography gas chromatography lc gc method
6439,dcf was absorbed well through the cornea with the aqueous humor concentration peak being ng ml at min
6440,this good ocular absorption of dcf was confirmed by the concentrations observed in plasma
6441,the presence of tramazoline tmz cas in the eye drops increases the levels of dcf in aqueous humor
6442,the effect of feloran diclofenac sodium on rat liver mitochondria is studied
6443,it is shown that in concentrations of the order of mm feloran blocks the second or third point of the respiratory chain inhibits the soluble mitochondrial atpase and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation
6444,in addition there is also an increase in the ionic permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane
6445,these effects are assumed to be important for the anti inflammatory action of feloran
6446,to compare the tolerability of preserved diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha and preservative free diclofenac dicloftil
6447,thirty healthy volunteers received a single drop of voltaren ophtha in eye and a single drop of dicloftil in the other
6448,both drops were instilled at the same time in a single blind manner
6449,visual analog scale grading was used to measure ocular discomfort itch burn and pain
6450,grading was obtained before drop instillation and after s min min min and min
6451,both preparations caused discomfort itch burn and pain with a peak effect on all parameters at min
6452,however preservative free dicloftil proved to be more tolerable than preserved voltaren ophtha
6453,data show significantly lower reported levels of discomfort and itch up to min lower levels of burn at the first minute and less pain immediately after instillation
6454,this is the first study to compare subjective ocular tolerability of a single drop
6455,our results indicate that dicloftil has better tolerability than voltaren ophtha
6456,ophthalmologists should be aware of this significant difference when prescribing diclofenac especially in patients with low compliance or who require prolonged therapy
6457,to determine whether systemic diclofenac sodium affects the maintenance of mydriasis during phacoemulsification and to compare pupil diameter regression rates with those in a control group
6458,an ophthalmic unit of a national health service trust hospital in the united kingdom
6459,a prospective randomized control study of patients presenting for cataract surgery was undertaken
6460,both groups were administered an identical mydriatic regime commencing hour before surgery
6461,in addition the diclofenac group n received mg of oral diclofenac sodium hour before surgery
6462,both the control n and diclofenac groups had phacoemulsification by one experienced surgeon using a standard technique
6463,the surgeon was masked as to which group the patient belonged
6464,the irrigating fluid in all cases contained adrenaline
6465,pupil diameter was measured at five stages during surgery and recorded along with the times relative to the start of the procedure
6466,mean pupil diameter in the diclofenac group was slightly larger than in the control group but the difference was not significant
6467,although mean pupil diameter at the start of surgery was mm greater in the diclofenac group the slopes of regression in pupil diameters were virtually identical between the first three stages of surgery after which a slight reversal occurred in both groups
6468,the slope of regression of mydriasis was small in both groups
6469,systemic diclofenac sodium mg given orally hour before surgery did not significantly inhibit miosis when compared with a control group
6470,regression rates of pupil mydriasis were small in both groups
6471,chondroitin sulfate cs is a potential candidate for colon specific drug carriers
6472,however the readily water soluble nature limits its application as a solid state drug delivery vehicle
6473,in this study the cs formation of a polyelectrolyte complex pec with ca cs ca was adapted to retain cs in a solid form for use in a drug delivery system
6474,pre treated cs with poly ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether ex followed by complexation with ca was also tested cs ca ex
6475,diclofenac sodium was used as a drug probe to evaluate the performance of the drug release behavior of the complexes
6476,the amount of diclofenac sodium released was higher in simulated intestinal fluid sif than in simulated gastric fluid sgf due to the anionic groups on cs or the higher solubility of drug itself in pbs
6477,the release profile of diclofenac sodium from cs ca ex was most notably sustained when compared to other groups
6478,enzymatic degradation by chondroitinase abc of cs cs ca and cs ca ex exhibited a similar degradation mechanism and gpc revealed the dissolution rate of cs from the three matrix types was in decreasing order cs cs ca cs ca ex
6479,the synergy of the anti inflammatory activity of diclofenac sodium in cs based complexes was evaluated using the carrageenan induced edema rat test
6480,the percentage of swelling was lower for all experimental groups as compared to the control untreated group
6481,the anti inflammatory activity of diclofenac in the cs matrix gradually increased up to h but cs ca or cs ca ex matrices showed less potency than the cs matrix in reducing inflammation
6482,sodium diclofenac inhibits hyperthermia induced by paradoxical sleep deprivation psd which suggests the participation of prostaglandins
6483,the temperature of paradoxical sleep deprived rats increased from the first to the fourth day of deprivation
6484,this hyperthermia was blocked on the second third and fourth days by daily administration twice a day of mg kg of sodium diclofenac a potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor
6485,in the dose of mg kg a decrease of temperature was observed only on the second and third days of psd
6486,these data suggest the participation of prostaglandins in modulating the increase in temperature during psd
6487,the irritative micturition syndrome is commonly observed following endoscopic surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia
6488,this condition almost consistently presents following removal of the bladder catheter and may last from to days
6489,the present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of treatment with diclofenac sodium
6490,fifty patients submitted to endoscopic resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia received the agent im a few hours prior to catheter removal and posteriorly via the rectal route for a total treatment period of days
6491,good results were achieved in of the cases
6492,mild side effects were observed in of the patients
6493,considering the advantageous for the rectal administration of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs the objective of this study was to formulate and evaluate rectal mucoadhesive hydrogels loaded with diclofenac sodium chitosan dfs cs microspheres
6494,hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc and w w and carbopol w w hydrogels containing dfs cs microspheres equivalent to w w active drug were prepared
6495,the physicochemical characterization revealed that all hydrogels had a suitable ph for rectal application
6496,the consistency of hpmc hydrogels showed direct proportionality to the concentration of the gelling agent while carbopol gel showed its difficulty for rectal administration
6497,farrow s constant for all hydrogels were greater than one indicating pseudoplastic flow
6498,in vitro drug release from the mucoadhesive hydrogel formulations showed a controlled drug release pattern reaching after h the kinetic analysis of the release data revealed that zero order was the prominent release mechanism
6499,the mucoadhesion time of w w hpmc hydrogel was min allowing the loaded microspheres to be attached to the surface of rectal mucosa
6500,histopathological examination demonstrated the lowest irritant response to the hydrogel loaded with dfs cs microspheres in response to other forms of the drug
6501,diclofenac sodium is an ideal candidate for incorporation in a controlled release device to diminish its adverse effects after oral administration
6502,microspheres were prepared by using sodium alginate as a polymer and cacl as a cross linking agent
6503,in this investigation full factorial design was used to investigate the joint influence of the three variables the stirring speed x concentration of cacl x and of heavy liquid paraffin in a blend of heavy and light liquid paraffin in the dispersion medium x on the time of drug dissolution t
6504,potential variables such as concentration of sodium alginate and drug sodium alginate ratio were kept constant in the experimental design
6505,a statistical model with significant interaction terms is derived to predict t
6506,the results of multiple linear regression analysis and f statistics revealed that for obtaining controlled drug release the microspheres should be prepared using relatively lower stirring speed higher concentration of cacl and higher percentage of heavy liquid paraffin in the dispersion medium
6507,the xx and xx interactions were found to be statistically significant in nature
6508,a response surface plot is presented to show the effects of x x and x on t
6509,the drug was released by diffusion of anomalous type
6510,a model was validated for accurate prediction of drug release profile
6511,acceptable batches were identified in the experimental design with constraints on percentage drug released in and h
6512,a non steroidal anti inflammatory agent diclofenac sodium dfna was incorporated into the ph sensitive monolithic systems prepared by crosslinking copolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate hema with acrylate based acidic and basic comonomers i e
6513,acrylic acid aa and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate dmaema
6514,drug loading was done before polymerization and crosslinking
6515,hence dfna containing polymeric discs approximately mm in diameter and mm in thickness were obtained
6516,in vitro release studies were carried out in simulated gastric fluid for h followed by simulated intestinal fluid at degrees c the release rate of dfna was controlled by changing the composition of polymeric matrix disc thickness and the drug loading between and mg disc
6517,results indicate that in the low ph of the stomach swelling degree of the aa containing gels is low and less than of the drug releases during first h but in the intestine the high ph causes the higher swelling degree of the aa containing discs allowing all the drug approximately is released
6518,in the presence of dmaema in polymeric structure opposite behavior was observed
6519,to study the effects of commonly used non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium on the kidneys of young albino rats after therapeutic dose
6520,early clinical and pharmacological studied of oral and parental forms of diclofenac sodium began shortly after the drug was discovered
6521,however there is scanty information about the toxicities of normal dose of diclofenac in young albino rats
6522,the present study is therefore designed to observe the gross and microscopic changes in kidney following administration of this drug in young albino rats
6523,for this experimental study albino rats were used they were divided into two groups each comprising of animals
6524,group received normal saline ml kg body weight while group received diclofenac sodium mg kg body weight for two weeks
6525,micrometry was done on kidney tissue for proximal and distal tubular count their diameter and the no of cells in these tubules
6526,highly significant changes were observed both in proximal and distal tubules of kidney
6527,even in therapeutic doses diclofenac sodium causes damage to kidney tubules in young albino rats
6528,aqueous solubility of diclofenac diethylamine ddea a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug currently formulated as a topical emulgel was studied in the presence of pharmaceutical additives and compared with diclofenac sodium ds
6529,electrolytes at low concentrations exhibited a salting in effect on ddea with peak solubility that was attributed to the association of ddea into micelles followed by a salting out effect at higher concentrations by which structure formation by ddea molecules increased and precipitation occurred
6530,for ds which is not capable of forming micelles the salting out effect was dominant due to the common ion effect
6531,cosolvents displayed significant enhancement in solubility of both salts except glycerol which showed a slight increase in solubility of ddea and a decrease in solubility of ds due to transformation into the less soluble hydrate form
6532,ethanol and polyethylene glycol peg cosolvent systems at all concentrations showed positive deviations from the log linear solubility equation
6533,in the case of propylene glycol pg cosolvent systems negative deviations were observed at low volume fractions of cosolvent while positive deviations were observed at high volume fractions of cosolvent for ds and ddea
6534,the parent drug being less ionizable and highly nonpolar showed negative deviations up to pg content
6535,thus the positive deviations for ds and ddea could be attributed to the more ionizable carboxylic group and its higher ability for hydrogen bonding at higher fractions of cosolvent
6536,polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and peg or peg enhanced the solubility of ds and ddea with pvp exerting higher solubilizing efficiency and ds showing better solubility than ddea
6537,solubilities of ds in tween t and pluronic f pf aqueous solutions were almost similar while the solubility of ddea in the presence of t was higher than the solubility in the presence of pf
6538,ds appeared to be located more in the polyoxyethylene mantle of the micelles while ddea was located more in the core of the micelles
6539,the buccal delivery of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug diclofenac sodium voltaren from a prototype hydrogel was studied in man in a randomized crossover design of buccal delivery and i v
6541,after a min delay plasma levels of diclofenac increased to near steady state levels of ng ml by hr
6542,with each subject serving as his own control the i v
6543,infusion data facilitated the calculation of a mean steady state flux of diclofenac sodium of mg cm hr across human buccal mucosa and a time lag of hr
6544,the large flux of this ionized species indicates that the traditional lipoidal model of buccal permeation based on the partition coefficient is inadequate

6549,the microspheres showed drug loading of and w w with an average size range of m depending upon the drug polymer ratio
6550,they were spherical in nature and free from surface drug as evidenced by the sem photographs
6551,ft ir dsc and xrd revealed the absence of drug polymer interaction and amorphous nature of entrapped drug
6552,gas chromatography confirms the absences of residual glutaraldehyde
6553,the formulated microspheres could prolong the drug release up to days in vitro
6554,about and of administered drug in the microspheres were recovered from the target joint after and days of postintra articular injection respectively revealing good targeting efficiency
6555,in experimental animal models nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs may influence gastrointestinal motility but as evidence is lacking in man

6557,on the motor response of the upper gastrointestinal tract to food has been studied by manometry in healthy volunteers
6558,diclofenac had no effect on the motor activity of the stomach duodenum or jejunum after a kcal meal
6559,we describe a case of severe pulmonary hypertension and transient right sided hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a neonate caused by premature closure of ductus arteriosus after short term maternal use of diclofenac sodium voltaren
6560,in view of this associated complication diclofenac sodium should be avoided during pregnancy
6561,in addition maternal diclofenac sodium ingestion should be suspected if a newborn develops severe pulmonary hypertension and or right sided hypertrophic cardiomyoptathy with closed ductus arteriosus
6562,the aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality to control the drug release of a new architecture of microparticles organized at the nanoscopic scale by assembling polymeric nanocapsules at the surface of drug loaded xerogels

6585,in a randomized single blind study carried out simultaneously in five departments for pain therapy and palliative care the analgesic efficacy and side effects of oral ketorolac ketorolac tromethamine tora dol cas and diclofenac sodium were compared in a population of advanced cancer patients suffering from somatic and or visceral pain
6586,the treatment was carried out in agreement with the first step of the who pharmacological strategy in cancer pain
6587,the administered dosage was mg every h for ketorolac and mg every h for diclofenac sodium
6588,the study showed the efficacy of both drugs in cancer pain
6589,a greater number of keterolac patients could pass to the second who step later than diclofenac patients
6590,as to the tolerability both drugs turned out to be similar except for sleepiness which was four times more frequent p in the diclofenac group
6591,actinic keratoses are increasingly common skin lesions that are evaluated and treated by dermatologists on a daily basis

6601,with the increased prevalence of actinic keratoses it is important to consider and evaluate emerging therapeutic options
6602,the sequential treatment with cryosurgery followed by diclofenac sodium gel for days is well tolerated and can provide a therapeutic modality that may provide patients with actinic keratoses a more successful outcome than monotherapy with cryosurgery by effectively treating clinical and subclinical lesions
6603,a method for determination of the drug diclofenac sodium introduced into individual human erythrocytes by electroporation using capillary zone electrophoresis with electrochemical detection at a carbon fiber array microelectrode was developed
6604,in this method the whole cell was injected into the separation capillary by electromigration

6610,the objective of this study was to develop uncoated hpmc matrix tablets evaluating the relationship and influence of different content levels of microcrystalline cellulose mcc starch and lactose in order to achieve a zero order release of diclofenac sodium
6611,hpmc matrix tablets of diclofenac sodium using microcrystalline cellulose mcc starch and lactose were prepared by wet granulation process
6612,the usp paddle method was selected to perform the dissolution profiles carried out in ml n hcl and phosphate buffer
6613,there was no significant difference in drug release between the hydrophilic matrices when the hpmc concentration was modified in low percentage
6614,release kinetics of diclofenac sodium from these swollen matrices was principally regulated by starch percent or lactose percent even on the presence of mcc
6615,when starch percent and lactose percent were mixed at lower concentration in a ratio mcc percent or percent appeared to control the drug release
6616,the release profile remained unchanged after three months storage of tablets
6617,the best fit release kinetics was achieved with the zero order plot followed by the higuchi and first order equations
6618,the data obtained proved that the formulations are useful for a sustained release of diclofenac due to the percentage released after hours is nearly to percent
6619,the release of diclofenac sodium was influenced by the presence of mcc and by the different concentrations of starch and lactose
6620,drug release kinetics from these formulations corresponded best to the zero order kinetics
6621,compared to conventional tablets release of the model drug from these hpmc matrix tablets was prolonged as a result an oral release dosage form to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects was achieved
6622,one hundred and twenty adult patients with high temperatures greater than or equal to degrees c brought about by influenza viruses or other conditions were randomly treated with two different antipyretics a a mg sodium diclofenac tablet novapirina every hours for consecutive days b a mg tablet of acetylsalicylic acid aspirin every hours for consecutive days
6623,antipyretic action assessed at hours following the first administration was found to be equally rapid and consistent in both cases but significantly longer lasting in the novapirina treated group than the aspirin treated group p less than
6624,mean temperature changes over the hours of observation and the over all judgement on the antipyretic effect expressed at the end of each day of treatment were similar for both groups and good in all cases
6625,the antiphlogistic painkilling properties of both drugs were found to be effective in improving the symptomatology accompanying the high temperature during the course of the bout of influenza
6626,the effectiveness tolerability ratio was found to be satisfactory for both groups only one case of gastric intolerance to novapirina was recorded and five cases of gastric intolerance to aspirin
6627,the results of patients treated with diclofenac for to months in comparative and non comparative trials are presented
6628,maximal improvement tended to occur in the first to months of treatment and was generally maintained
6629,diclofenac was at least as effective as equivalent doses of indomethacin and naproxen and when treatment lasts more than months may be more effective
6630,the majority of patients reporting unwanted effects or discontinuing treatment did so in the first months
6631,unwanted effects similar to those in short term trials were mainly gastrointestinal
6632,central nervous system cardiovascular and dermatological side effects were reported in or less of patients
6633,the long term laboratory tolerability of diclofenac was good with no changes in the nature frequency or severity of abnormal tests with increasing duration of treatment
6634,during the development of diclofenac sodium voltarol various types of long term investigation were conducted table i

6639,to evaluate the effect of diclofenac sodium on reducing intraocular pressure iop by latanoprost in glaucoma patients
6640,twenty two patients with bilateral primary open angle glaucoma were enrolled in this study
6641,all patients had been given only latanoprost for at least weeks
6642,topical diclofenac sodium was additionally applied to one eye dicloptin group whereas hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose was administered into the other eye control group both times a day for weeks
6643,iop measurement was performed before and weeks after the administrations and also weeks after discontinuing additional ophthalmic solutions
6644,no significant difference was observed in the iops before additional administration of ophthalmic solution between the dicloptin group and the control group p
6645,additional administration of diclofenac sodium increased mean iop from to mm hg p
6646,this increase was reversed weeks after discontinuing additional solutions p however no significant difference in mean iop was observed in the control group after administration and after discontinuing the additional medication p and respectively
6647,topical diclofenac sodium may interfere with the iop lowering effect of latanoprost in glaucoma patients therefore this interference should be noted in coadministration of these drugs
6648,diclofenac a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid is widely used for the management of various musculoskeletal conditions
6649,an injectable test formulation of diclofenac sodium mg ml was prepared to facilitate reduction in injection volume as compared to already marketed formulations of diclofenac sodium mg ml
6650,the objective of this study was to compare the bioavailability of test formulation with the reference formulation given intramuscularly in healthy volunteers
6651,this two way randomized crossover study was performed in healthy adult indian male human subjects to compare bioavailability
6652,the formulations were administered intramuscularly intragluteal to the volunteers in a two way randomized fashion with a wash out period of days
6653,blood samples were collected till h following drug administration
6654,the samples were analyzed using pre validated hplc method
6655,the mean cmax and tmax for the test and reference formulations were g ml g ml and h h respectively
6656,the mean auc t for test and reference formulations were g h ml and g h ml respectively
6657,the mean auc for test and reference formulation were g h ml and g h ml respectively
6658,the mean ci c max auc t and auc ratio test reference were and respectively
6659,the test formulation shows a comparable auc t and auc but a higher c max in comparison to the reference when given intra gluteally
6660,the lower volume of the test formulation offers advantage of injection at other sites like deltoid region
6661,absence of propylene glycol in the test formulation could be advantageous in terms of improved tolerability
6662,hence such formulations of previously well established molecules provide a new direction towards developing better and convenient dosing alternatives
6663,the purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential utility of chitosan i in inhibiting diclofenac sodium ii release in the gastric environment from a directly compressible tablet formulation
6664,i subjected to depolymerization to improve its microcrystallinity and subsequent compressibility was then used to prepare tablets of ii
6665,a full factorial design was employed to evaluate the effects of degree of n deacetylation of i and the ph and ionic strengths mu of the dissolution media on drug release
6666,directly compressible tablets were prepared from admixtures of mg of ii mg of i of various degrees of n deacetylation and and mg of magnesium stearate
6667,the in vitro dissolution studies were performed using aqueous buffers phs and and mu of approximately and
6668,the slopes of logarithmically transformed cumulative percent released time curves from t to t hr were compared
6669,analyses of variance performed using sas indicated that the degree of n deacetylation of chitosan significantly affected drug release at phs and p
6670,an increase in the ph of the dissolution medium resulted in an increase in drug release p
6671,the ionic strength of the dissolution medium did not significantly affect drug release at any of the phs studied p
6672,besides the poor aqueous solubility of ii the two factors possibly affecting the drug release in the acidic environment were a the formation of a rate limiting chitosan gel barrier and b the ionic interaction of ii with ionized amino groups of i
6673,a controlled trial of diclofenac sodium was carried out in patients undergoing intracapsular cataract extraction
6674,all patients were treated with dexamethasone eyedrops twice daily plus either diclofenac sodium mg tid or matching placebo tid started hours before surgery and continued for four weeks
6675,in comparison with those in the placebo group patients in the diclofenac group showed significant decreases in most signs of ocular inflammation
6676,diclofenac therapy was well tolerated except in one patient and may safely be used to reduce intraocular inflammation
6677,the bioavailability of a generic diclofenac sodium sustained release tablet preparation zolterol sr was compared with the innovator product voltaren sr twelve healthy adult male volunteers participated in the study which was conducted according to a randomized two way crossover design with a wash out period of one week
6678,the bioavailability of diclofenac was compared using the parameters area under the plasma concentration time curve auc infinity peak plasma concentration cmax and time to reach peak plasma concentration tmax
6679,no statistically significant difference was observed for both logarithmically transformed auc infinity cmax values and tmax value of the two preparations
6680,the contents of diclofenac sodium and codeine phosphate in shuerfen tablets may be determined simultaneously by cpa matrix method without separation of its components
6681,the program was edited by basic
6682,the average recoveries and rsd were for diclofenac sodium and codeine phosphate respectively
6683,this method is simple and rapid and the result is accurate
6684,seventy five mg diclofenac sodium were given intramuscularly to subjects alone and in combination with mg triamcinolone acetate
6685,plasma levels of diclofenac were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
6686,the results indicate no statistically significant differences for most of the parameters
6687,the maximum plasma concentrations cpmax was increased by about in combination with the glucocorticoid whereas terminal elimination rate did not change significantly
6688,one of the important points in extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is to maintain mydriasis during the intervention
6689,in this study we compared the efficacy of two topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac sodium naclof and indomethacin used before cataract surgery to inhibit surgically induced miosis
6690,sixty four patients were operated ecce with iol by three experienced surgeons
6691,all patients received dilatating drops and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs every minutes in five doses beginning hours before surgery
6692,patients received diclofenac sodium and patients indomethacin
6693,pupil diameters were measured three times first just before the initial limbal incision second at the end of cortical aspiration and the last after implantation of an intraocular lens
6694,in both groups the surgical manipulations induced a decrease in pupil diameter but more in the group treated with indomethacin
6695,diclofenac sodium appeared to be more potent than indomethacin in maintaining intraoperative mydriasis during cataract surgery
6696,an intermediate mesophase of lyotropic liquid crystalline structure from the ternary mixtures of glycerol monooleate water and ethanol was recently characterized in our lab
6697,this mesophase termed q l consists of discrete discontinuous micelles arranged in a cubic array
6698,the q l phase can solubilize very significant loads of water insoluble anti inflamatory drug sodium diclofenac na dfc
6699,close examination of the internal structures of the lyotropic liquid structure upon increasing the solubilization loads reveals the existence of three structural transitions controlled by the na dfc levels
6700,up to wt na dfc the q l structure remains intact with some influence on the hydration of the headgroups and on the intermicellar forces
6701,however at to wt na dfc the discontinuous micellar cubic phase is transformed into a more condensed mesophase of a bicontinuous cubic phase
6702,at or wt na dfc the cubic phase is converted into a lamellar phase l alpha
6703,within to wt na dfc the mesophase is progressively transformed into a less ordered lamellar structure
6704,at wt na dfc crystals tend to precipitate out
6705,at low na dfc concentrations the drug behaves like a lyotropic or kosmotropic salt and can salt out the surfactant from its water layer but at higher levels it behaves like a hydrotropic chaotropic salt and can salt in the surfactant
6706,the na dfc location and position within the interface as well as its polarization and partial ionization are strongly affected by its solubilization contents and the structure that it is inducing
6707,in the cubic phase the drug is located less close to the hydration layer while once transition occurs it is exposed more to the water layer and the surfactant headgroups
6708,intercalation compounds of ternary layered inorganic materials synthetic mica na tsm with diclofenac sodium dfs and its drug release characteristics were investigated
6709,hygroscopic dfs was selected as a model drug to verify the anti humidity and anti oxidation of the intercalation compounds
6710,na tsm powder was first mixed with the reduced type phosphatidylcholine h pc solution of chloroform or ethanol
6711,dfs was then mixed with these solutions and heated at degrees c to prepare the ternary na tsm h pc dfs compound
6712,a remarkable phenomenon was observed in the drug release study
6713,the net amount of dfs from the dfs powder decreased apparently after min arising from the decomposition of dfs in acidic medium
6714,on the other hand the net amount of the released dfs from the intercalation compound was invariant
6715,thermal analyses study indicated that dfs powder was hygroscopic and a significant endothermic peak was observed accompanied by a large weight loss due to the dehydration of adsorbed water from to degrees c on the other hand no significant dehydration reaction was observed in the intercalation compounds even in the sample stored under humid conditions
6716,the present results indicated that the ternary intercalation compound was resistant to acid in addition to anti humidity
6717,application of nanofiber based nanomats in medicine is attractive and thanks to the d nanostructure and the high surface to volume ratio they are excellent for local controlled drug delivery
6718,the use of bioactive bioerodible polymers for developing drug delivery nanomats may allow for drug release and targeting control
6719,objective of the current study was to evaluate the suitability of bioerodible polymeric material based on n butyl hemiester of poly maleic anhydride alt methoxyethyl vinyl ether pam for the preparation of nanomats for controlled administration of anti inflammatory diclofenac sodium ds drug
6720,samples were prepared using different polymer concentrations in either ethanol or acetic acid as solvent
6721,morphology was investigated by using scanning electron microscopy sem
6722,thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry dsc was performed to detect effect on polymer arrangement
6723,ds localization in electrospun nanomats was evaluated by using electron back scattering microanalysis based on the detection of chlorine and drug release kinetics was assessed using uv vis
6724,average fiber diameter resulted in the range of nm to microm and a homogeneous distribution of the loaded drug into the fibers was observed
6725,the ds release was immediate and despite the preliminary nature of the performed electrospinning experiments the achieved results appear promising for the future development of a novel system for the controlled and targeted administration of drug and active agent
6726,the aim of this study was to prepare ph sensitive sodium alginate calcined hydrotalcite sa cht hybrid bead with improved the burst release effect of the drug
6727,materials and methods a series of ph sensitive sa cht hybrid beads were prepared by using ca cross linking in the presence of diclofenac sodium ds and sa
6728,the structure and drug loading of the beads were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray diffraction
6729,the swelling and the drug release of the fabricated beads were investigated by the ph of test medium and cht content
6730,the formed positively charged hydrotalcite layers were adsorbed on the negatively charged sa polymer chains through electrostatic interaction and act as inorganic cross linkers in the three dimensional network
6731,compared to pure sa beads the incorporation of cht enhanced the drug encapsulation efficiency improved the swelling behaviors and slowed the drug release from the hybrid beads
6732,the electrostatic interaction between hydrotalcite and sa has restricted the movability of the sa polymer chains and then slowed down swelling and dissolution rates in aqueous solutions
6733,the results provided a simple method to moderate drug release and matrix degradation of the sa beads
6734,intestinal injury resulting from ischemia reperfusion i r is of fundamental importance in clinical pediatric surgery
6735,i r injury results from inadequate oxygen delivery as well as a secondary inflammatory response involving neutrophils and oxidants
6736,this study was designed to evaluate a novel use for diclofenac sodium ds a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent and to compare it with traditional antioxidants in this setting
6737,rats were subjected to intestinal ischemia followed by reperfusion
6738,when killed samples were obtained for measurement of intestinal myeloperoxidase mpo a measure of neutrophil sequestration as well as for adenosine triphosphate atp content a marker of tissue injury
6739,animals exposed to i r injury had significant neutrophil sequestration in the intestine by minutes of ischemia and this persisted after minutes of reperfusion
6740,ds pretreatment did not prevent neutrophil sequestration in the intestine
6741,analysis of intestinal atp content demonstrated a decrease in intestinal atp after minutes of ischemia and this did not change with minutes of reperfusion
6742,pretreatment with ds significantly attenuated this intestinal atp depletion
6743,furthermore with minutes of ischemia and minutes of reperfusion atp preservation with ds pretreatment exceeded that obtained using the following conventional antioxidants a xanthine oxidase inhibitor lodoxamide deferoxamine dimethysulfoxide and superoxide dismutase plus catalase
6744,ds has a significant cytoprotective effect for intestine subjected to i r injury exceeding that of conventional antioxidants
6745,ds does not attenuate injury by preventing neutrophil influx into injured intestine
6746,abstract truncated at words
6747,the present study aimed to investigate the possible postnatal effects on the liver kidney and testicular tissues of the offspring of rats given diclofenac sodium ds during pregnancy
6748,at the beginning of the experiment rats males and females were raised together for mating purposes
6749,at the end pregnant rats were obtained and used as the experimental subjects
6750,all pregnant rats were divided into groups each with rats
6751,the rats of the control group received physiological serum cm kg live weight per day and the rats of the treatment group were injected with ds mg kg live weight per day from the th to the th day of pregnancy
6752,four weeks after birth tissue samples were obtained under anesthesia by perfusion fixation from a total of offspring males females from the control group and males females from the ds group
6753,paraffin sections were dyed with hematoxylin eosin and examined under light microscopy
6754,the gestation period was significantly prolonged with ds treated rats p
6755,a moderate significant enlargement in the periportal area p sinusoidal dilatation p bile duct proliferation p pyknosis in the nucleus of hepatocytes and vacuolar degeneration in parenchymal cells p were observed in ds treated rats
6756,morphological changes in the liver were found to be similar both in female and male rats
6757,under light microscopy a similar morphological structure was observed in the kidney and testicular tissues of both the ds treated and control rats
6758,significant morphological changes were observed in the livers of the offspring whose parents had been treated with ds
6759,no significant differences were observed in liver morphology between the female and male offspring
6760,there were no significant effects of ds on the morphology of the kidney and testis in all offspring
6761,due to inflammatory reactions complicating bioabsorbable devices the aim of this study was to develop and characterize bioabsorbable implants with anti inflammatory drug releasing properties
6762,polylactide co glycolide plga was compounded with diclofenac sodium ds to produce rods
6763,thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry dsc
6764,inherent viscosity eta inh was measured to evaluate the drug effect on the extrude polymer
6765,drug release measurements were performed using uv spectrophotometer
6766,five parallel samples from each type of rods were examined first at hour intervals then on daily basis and later twice a week
6767,ds was released in days from thinner rods and in days from thicker rods
6768,drug release comprised a starting peak slow release phase then a high release phase and a burst release phase
6769,dsc analysis showed that ds containing rods had crystallinity in their structure
6770,in conclusions it is feasible to combine plga and ds by using melt extrusion
6771,released ds concentrations reached local therapeutic levels but the release profile was complex and therapeutic levels were not reached all the time
6772,complex pseudo ternary phase diagrams based on sucrose monolaurate se propylene glycol pg and phosphatidylcholine pc as the surfactant phase triacetin ta and decaglycerol ester gcc as the oil phase and water as the aqueous phase were constructed into which we solubilized the water insoluble drug sodium diclofenac na dfc
6773,in our previous study we demonstrated that the solubilization of na dfc in the oil surfactant phases prior to diluting it with water was fold greater than its dissolution in water and that the system was ph dependent
6774,the greatest na dfc solubilization capacity was obtained at ph in this study we examined the effect of the solubilization of na dfc in a phosphatidylcholine system using dls viscosity electrical conductivity saxs sd nmr and cryo tem measurements
6775,it was found that the system remains micellar after aqueous dilution but with greater polydispersity and greater variety of shapes
6776,we concluded that the structures in the absence of water but in the presence of pg were of direct spherical micelles nm mixed with elongated cylindrical micelles nm the aqueous dilution causes fragmentation of the cylinders into smaller spherical micelles solubilization of na dfc behaving like a kosmotropic agent or structure maker yields mostly spherical swollen micelles and more ordered systems than in its absence and na dfc is solubilized at the interface of the micelles without swelling the droplets
6777,platelets incubated with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors i e
6778,aspirin asa and diclofenac sodium voltaren show a decreased capability to aggregate
6779,while asa induces the complete loss of platelet pseudopodia voltaren causes the appearance of long needle shaped pseudopodia a finding which may suggest a rather increased tendency to aggregate
6780,platelets labeled with ferritin hydrazide and examined with a transmission electron microscope and by x ray analysis show a greater deposition of ferritin hydrazide after incubation with voltaren in comparison to those incubated with asa and to the controls
6781,this finding suggests an increased negative charge of the stretched platelet membrane after incubation with voltaren with a subsequent increase in the repulsive forces between platelets
6782,the efficacy and tolerance of mg day oxaprozin and mg day diclofenac sodium were compared in patients with ankylosing spondylitis in a week open study
6783,overall improvement was seen in the patients in both treatment groups
6784,oxaprozin treated patients showed significant improvement in spontaneous pain of the vertebral spine and in morning stiffness after weeks treatment
6785,there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups
6786,therapy was discontinued in patients five treated with oxaprozin three because of intolerance and two because of worsening of symptoms and five taking diclofenac sodium four because of intolerance and one because of worsening of symptoms
6787,five oxaprozin treated patients and six diclofenac sodium treated patients had side effects with gastro intestinal disturbances and dizziness reported most frequently
6788,there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the frequency of side effects
6789,these results indicate that oxaprozin is a promising therapeutic agent for ankylosing spondylitis
6790,nonionic surfactants which are a safe class of enhancers may offer means of enhancing drug permeation through the skin
6791,in order to determine this effect the influence of four nonionic surfactants on the percutaneous absorption of diclofenac sodium from carbopol gels containing propylene glycol was investigated
6792,in vitro diffusion experiments were carried out using excised full thickness abdominal rat skin as well as cellulose nitrate membranes
6793,the data of this study clearly revealed that tween decreased diclofenac penetration rate
6794,this was due to a decrease in thermodynamic activity as a result of micellar complexation
6795,in contrast the more hydrophobic sorbitans enhanced diclofenac skin penetration probably due to changes in the barrier properties of the skin and in the vehicle stratum corneum partition coefficient
6796,the most enhancing effect was induced by span a surfactant with a c saturated hydrophobic group
6797,however diffusional lag times for all the tested surfactants were longer than for the control gel

6809,the relative rectal bioavailability was
6810,the three ply walled based system for controlled delivery of diclofenac was developed
6811,the preparation of three ply walled microcapsules is essentially based on the technique of multiple emulsion formation polymer at the interface followed by rigidization of the wall on evaporation of solvent
6812,the protective colloids with surface active properties were selected for the present study viz
6813,acacia gelatin polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate
6814,ethyl cellulose was taken as hydrophobic polymer
6815,the acacia ethylcellulose acacia based three ply walled microcapsule system was selected for further studies
6816,the three ply walled microcapsule were subsequently coated with poloxamer the non ionic hydrophilic surfactant coating retards uptake into the reticuloendothelial system
6817,the coated and uncoated microcapsules were characterized for in vitro and in vivo performance
6818,the microcapsules were noted to provide sustained release of the contained diclofenac
6819,the plasma level observed indicated that poloxamer coating results in prolonged release of the drug
6820,organ distribution demonstrated a different distribution pattern when compared with uncoated microcapsules
6821,to report a case of anesthetic abuse keratopathy and to suggest the use of topical diclofenac sodium in the management of this disorder
6822,narcotics and topical diclofenac were used to control pain in a patient who developed a corneal ulcer after abusing topical anesthetics
6823,after the institution of topical diclofenac the patient reported substantial improvement in comfort and less reliance on narcotic agents for analgesia
6824,we found topical diclofenac to be useful in controlling pain in this patient with anesthetic abuse keratopathy
6825,we investigated the anti inflammatory effects of diclofenac sodium on anterior inflammation after cataract surgery
6826,fibrin precipitation after surgery in patients without systemic or ocular disease was markedly less when diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution was used in combination with topical corticosteroids
6827,there was also a reduction in fibrin precipitation in other patients especially in those with diabetes mellitus primary angle closure glaucoma and exfoliation syndrome
6828,in conclusion diclofenac sodium was shown to be clinically useful as a topical preparation to suppress inflammation after cataract surgery
6829,we have studied the morphine sparing effect of a single mg diclofenac sodium suppository following elective caesarean section performed under spinal anaesthesia
6830,fifty patients randomly allocated into a placebo or an active group were compared
6831,there was a statistically significant p reduction in total morphine consumption and in consumption calculated as mg kg h in the diclofenac group although pain scores were comparable in the two groups

6834,the effects of formulation and medium on pulsatile release of ds were investigated under release rate test
6835,pharmacokinetic and bioavailability study in eight human subjects were performed by hplc method
6836,the delayed release time and release rate of ds from ds prp were influenced obviously by the swelling material the concentration of sds in medium the coating level of the inner swelling layer and the outer controlled layer
6837,in vitro the delayed release time t was h and the pulsed release time t was h in vivo the delayed release time tlag was h and the bioavailability was
6838,the release of drug from ds prp was shown to be in pulsed way both in vitro and in vivo
6839,an automated method utilizing laboratory robotics has been developed for quantifying diclofenac sodium concentrations in human plasma
6840,the robotic system aliquots the biological sample adds the internal standard cgp extracts the compounds from the acidified biological matrix ph less than into an organic phase hexane isopropyl alcohol and concentrates the extracts for reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic hplc analysis
6841,the laboratory robot is directly interfaced to the hplc system and the data are automatically collected and results calculated
6842,separation is achieved on a microns ods mm x cm column with ultraviolet uv detection of the drug and internal standard at nm
6843,recovery and reproducibility assessments indicate good accuracy overall mean relative recovery of and precision coefficient of variation from to over the diclofenac sodium concentration range of ng ml with a quantification limit of ng ml
6844,the method has been successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in which normal volunteers received mg of a prototype controlled release formulation of diclofenac sodium
6845,the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium was given as suppository in the treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis in patients
6846,the statistically significant difference in response to diclofenac sodium and to placebo leads us to use diclofenac sodium in primary nocturnal enuresis
6847,the antipyretic effect of diclofenac sodium mg kg i v
6848,was studied prospectively in icu patients
6849,patients with renal failure and hypovolaemia were excluded from the study mean basal temperature measured by the pulmonary artery thermistor was degrees c sd
6850,in of the patients the temperature fell by more than degrees c within h of administration of the drug
6851,a minimum mean of degrees c sd was obtained by the hour the temperature then remained lower than basal throughout the entire observation period h
6852,changes in haemodynamics and oxygen consumption were consistent with the reduction in temperature
6853,changes in renal function were transient and did not require any therapeutic intervention
6854,we conclude that the proposed dosage in the selected patient population constitutes effective antipyretic treatment devoid of major side effects
6855,the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the in vitro and in vivo transdermal potential of w o microemulsion m and gel g bases for diclofenac sodium ds
6856,the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as a penetration enhancer was also examined when it was added to the m formulation
6857,to study the in vitro potential of these formulations permeation studies were performed with franz diffusion cells using excised dorsal rat skin
6858,to investigate their in vivo performance a carrageenan induced rat paw edema model was used
6859,the commercial formulation of ds c was used as a reference formulation
6860,the results of the in vitro permeation studies and the paw edema tests were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance
6861,the in vitro permeation studies found that m was superior to g and c and that adding dmso to m increased the permeation rate
6862,the permeability coefficients kp of ds from m and m dmso were higher kp x x cm h and x x cm h respectively than the kp of ds from c kp x x cm h and g kp x x cm h
6863,in the paw edema test m showed the best permeation and effectiveness and m dmso had nearly the same effect as m the in vitro and in vivo studies showed that m could be a new alternative dosage form for effective therapy
6864,to determine the effect of diclofenac sodium ds eyedrops made in china on preventing surgically induced miosis and inflammation
6865,seventy cases of cataract inpatients were randomly divided into two groups
6866,ds eyedrops and normal saline as placebo were applied respectively h h h before operation and once every morning for days after operation
6867,the pupil diameter was measured five times at different stages during the extracapsular cataract extraction
6868,the eyepain photophobia conjunctival injection kp aqueous flare and light reaction of pupil were observed once a day after operation for a week
6869,eyes in ds group and eyes in placebo group were included in the study
6870,of eyes in ds group maintained mydriasis in all stages of operation and eyes did not show any obvious sign of inflammation
6871,there was statistically significant difference between the two groups
6872,no serious side effects occurred in the ds group
6873,the ds eyedrops can prevent surgically induced miosis
6874,its antiinflammatory effect was significantly better than that of placebo drops
6875,our aim was to compare the analgesic affects of paracetamol and the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac sodium for the relief of postoperative pain in patients having bimaxillary osteotomy
6876,thirty patients were randomly allocated into two groups n in each using sealed envelopes
6877,the first group was given paracetamol g intravenously and the second diclofenac sodium mg intramuscularly
6878,the analgesics were given during the last min of the operation while the mucosa was being sutured
6879,the number of requests for further analgesia and the amount of analgesia given postoperatively as diclofenac sodium were recorded
6880,the intensity of postoperative pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale vas and postoperative requests for analgesia haemodynamic variables systolic blood pressure and heart rate and complications were compared
6881,the groups were comparable
6882,a single dose of diclofenac or paracetamol effectively decreases the intensity of postoperative pain after bimaxillary osteotomy
6883,thirty one patients with acute renal colic were treated with voltaren diclofenac sodium ciba
6884,the drug proved to be suitable for relieving and stopping pain
6885,adverse effects were observed but in few cases
6886,for this reason authors suggest a more extensive use of the drug
6887,the author reviews the worldwide picture of adverse reactions reported with diclofenac during the four year period ending in december at which point he estimates that some ten million patients had received treatment with the drug
6888,a total of unwanted effects were reported in patients the most frequently reported side effects being gastrointestinal in nature followed by dermatological and central nervous system effects
6889,thirteen cases of liver function abnormality were reported although there was reason to believe that of these were not ascribable to diclofenac
6890,twenty haematological effects were reported including two cases of agranulocytosis and two cases of fatal aplastic anaemia one patient in each of these groups was taking concomitant pyrazolone compounds
6891,evaluation of adverse reactions reported with diclofenac suggest a profile in which gastrointestinal side effects predominate however the risk of serious side effects of this nature is slight and the impression of good tolerability which emerges from this review is confirmed by the findings of comparative clinical trials
6892,a randomized double blind study of parturients after cesarean section was undertaken to assess the efficacy of the combination of single dose intramuscular diclofenac sodium and low dose epidural morphine em for postoperative analgesia
6893,parturients under epidural anesthesia were divided into treatment groups group a received mg em min after the last dose of lidocaine and ml normal saline i m
6894,at recovery room group b received the same em and mg diclofenac i m
6896,pain scores were compared at the nd th th th th and th h results showed that group b was superior to group a in analgesic quality from the th h and thereafter p less than and patients in group b were in the excellent to good analgesia categories at the th and th h record compared to and patients in group a respectively
6897,side effects were similar in both groups
6898,the combination of nsaids with low dose em could improve the analgesic quality after cesarean section
6899,antimicrobial property of ten antiinflammatory drugs was tested with eleven sensitive bacteria belonging to both gram positive and gram negative types
6900,since most of the bacteria were moderate to highly sensitive to diclofenac dc this compound was tested in vitro against bacteria most of which were inhibited by dc at micrograms ml level
6901,when tested in vivo dc at and micrograms g body weight of a swiss strain of white mice could significantly protect the animals challenged with mld of salmonella typhimurium nctc according to chi test the in vivo data were highly significant p
6902,cattle bile cb has long been used in japan as an ingredient of digestive medicines
6903,bile acids are major chemical constituents of cb and cb ingestion is assumed to affect small intestinal injury induced by nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
6904,mice were fed a diet supplemented with or without cb for days and treated with diclofenac sodium dif to induce small intestinal injury
6905,lesion formation was enhanced and pge content and cox expression levels were elevated in the small intestine of dif treated mice fed the cb diet compared with those fed the control diet
6906,the administration of a reconstituted mixture of bile acids found in cb enhanced lesion formation in dif treated mice
6907,cb administration elevated the contents of cb derived bile acids in the small intestine some of which exhibited a high cytotoxicity to cultured intestinal epithelial cells
6908,these results suggest that the elevated levels of cb derived cytotoxic bile acids in the small intestine contribute to the aggravation of dif induced small intestinal injury
6909,the use of cb may be limited during the therapy of inflammatory diseases with nsaids
6910,large liposomes microm containing sodium diclofenac were prepared and lyophilized using lactose or mannitol in respect to the lipid content as cryoprotectants
6911,the physical studies of liposomes were performed during days of storage in a dry or resuspended form
6912,lyophilization of large liposomes and storage in the dry form at degrees c increases their physical stability
6913,lactose is a cryoprotectant which does not influence changes of properties of liposomes regarding their size encapsulation efficacy and release rate
6914,large liposomes lyophilized in the presence of mannitol tend to increase in size and encapsulation efficacy but the lipid bilayers are stabilized and less permeable to the drug
6915,to assess the efficacy of paracetamol in comparison with diclofenac sodium
6916,between february november a prospective double blinded parallel group study of patients suffering from first or second degree lateral ankle sprain within hours of admission in tepecik education and research hospital izmir turkey
6917,patients with bilateral injury ipsilateral knee injury third degree sprain previous sprain within months and ankle pain less than according to visual analogue score vas were excluded
6918,patients rated pain on a vas representing no pain maximal pain
6919,after enrollment patients were randomized with diclofenac sodium mg day or paracetamol mg day for days
6920,clinical assessments were carried out at baseline on second tenth days and sixth week end of study
6921,in each visit vas and adverse effects of medication were questioned
6922,the mean vas of the diclofenac group was and with paracetamol group at the first visit
6923,these scores decreased to in diclofenac group and in paracetamol group at the second tenth days and last examination
6924,similar reductions in pain were observed at the end of study p in both groups
6925,however cases treated by paracetamol group showed accelerated decrease in vas at day and in comparison with diclofenac group p
6926,of the ankle range of motion there was a similar improvement in both groups degrees degrees p
6927,the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects on diclofenac group was much more than the paracetamol group however there was no significant difference p
6928,it was concluded that diclofenac sodium and paracetamol are effective and well tolerated as a short term treatment alternatives for acute ankle injuries
6929,a comparative randomized double blind study of diclofenac sodium mg im versus baralgin a combination drug composed of dipyrone and two spasmolytics ml iv was performed on patients with renal colic
6930,both groups were comparable as to age sex pain evolution time before treatment and no treatment for renal colic in the six hours preceding trial drug administration
6931,no significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the evolution of pain after the first dose or in the frequency of administration of a second dose
6932,tolerability was good in both groups but sweating and pain throughout the vein were observed in one patient in the baralgin group
6933,we concluded that diclofenac sodium constitutes an excellent alternative to pyrazolone analgesics with the advantages of being monotherapy and having good tolerability when used as intramuscular injection in ambulatory patients
6934,in the present study two sustained release diclofenac preparations were administered every hours over days to ten human volunteers
6935,diurnal profiles were recorded on the st and th days from which pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated particular attention was given to cumulation
6936,one a newly developed sustained release formulation had a mrt of hours and showed surprisingly small variation coefficients auc ss hrs cmax ss hrs after administered doses accordingly the maximum concentrations were within a very narrow time window tmax ss hrs range hours after administration
6937,due to the selected release profiles with this formulation there was no danger of cumulation in spite of administration every hours auc hrs mean value ng ml x h auc ss hrs mean value ng ml x h

6946,diclofenac sodium induced nephrotoxicity causes the destruction of proximal and distal convoluted tubules showing the dilatation of tubule and flattening of its epithelium in albino rats
6947,the aim of this study was to formulate and evaluate microencapsulated controlled release preparations of diclofenac sodium dfs using different proportions of ethyl cellulose ec as the retardant material to extend the release
6948,the formulated microcapsules were then compressed into tablets to obtain controlled release oral formulations
6949,phase separation coacervation technique was employed to prepare microcapsules of dfs using different proportions of ec in cyclohexane
6950,physical characteristics of microcapsules and their tablets in vitro release pattern of the designed microcapsules and their tablets prepared from them were studied using usp dissolution apparatus usp type paddle method in triple distilled water
6951,the prepared microcapsules were white free flowing and spherical in shape with the particle size varying from microm
6952,the duration of dfs release from microcapsules was found to be directly proportional to the proportion of ec and thus coat thickness
6953,all tablets were of good quality with respect to appearance drug content uniformity hardness weight variation friability and thickness uniformity
6954,in vitro release study of the tabletted microcapsules in triple distilled water showed a zero order release kinetics and extended release beyond h a good correlation was obtained between drug release t and proportion of ec in the microcapsules
6955,in the case of tabletted microcapsules very good correlation could be established between t proportion of ec weight of the tablets and between release rate constant k and proportion of ec

6958,the drug was administered to patients once a day in three consecutive migraine attacks
6959,if pain still remained after h following administration the patient was given a mg diclofenac sodium suppository in open condition
6960,evaluation was by a complete medical examination performed by the physician and by the patient completing a specially designed self assessment card
6961,a total of eight patients dropped out of the trial all during placebo administration three due to poor compliance four for refusal to continue and one because no further migraine attacks developed
6962,results were analysed after having checked the absence of both period and carry over effects
6963,in all cases diclofenac sodium was more effective than placebo p less than
6964,this was also confirmed by data obtained from the patient self assessment cards p less than and by preferences expressed by patients at the end of the trial p less than
6965,tolerance to the drug was similar to that of placebo
6966,in a double blind comparison with placebo in patients suffering from post operative pain following the surgical removal of a third molar in the lower jaw statistical analyses showed that voltaren diclofenac sodium in a single dose of mg had a significantly greater analgesic effect than placebo
6967,the technique to be used for studies with analgesic drugs is briefly discussed
6968,to report the use of sodium diclofenac an antagonist of ppar gamma and cyclooxigenase cox inhibitor in the treatment of mild to moderate graves ophthalmopathy

6970,extra ocular muscle restriction and cas improved significantly p and respectively
6971,ocular pain and diplopia disappeared except for one patient who reported improvement of these symptoms
6972,no recurrence was found after interruption of treatment
6973,treatment of moderate graves ophthalmopathy with oral sodium diclofenac is a good safe and less expensive therapeutic option
6974,like others new treatment trials findings must be confirmed in a greater number of patients in a controlled study
6975,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are often used for to days after fracture because of their effects on bone metabolism
6976,this study evaluated the effect of diclofenac sodium administered at clinical dosage and duration on bone union

7016,in patients receiving diclofenac median scores at h were range as compared with range in control patients p confidence limits mann whitney u test
7017,nausea scores return to diet and time to discharge did not differ significantly between the groups
7018,intramuscular diclofenac significantly reduces early postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and is worthy of consideration if the procedure were ever undertaken as day case surgery
7019,fluidized bed manufactured enteric coated diclofenac sodium pellets were compressed into tablets
7020,the blend of two aqueous acrylic resins dispersion in different ratios eudragit ned and eudragit ld were used to prepare enteric coated diclofenac sodium pellets of different particle sizes and coating level
7021,the cushioning pellets with different properties and these enteric coated pellets were compressed into tablets in different proportions
7022,the drug release of the tablets containing these pellets would be lower than in h in simulated gastric fluid but reach in h in simulated enteric fluid
7023,the mixture of eudragit ned and eudragit ld could be used to prepare enteric pellets which are suitable for compression
7024,the cushioning pellets which were composed of stearic acid microcrystalline cellulose w w could avoid rupture of the coating of pellets during the compression
7025,the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of diclofenac sodium when administered similar to its use in clinical practice weeks following different periods of complete reversible unilateral ureteric obstruction in the rat using accurate indicators of renal function
7026,male wistar rats underwent reversible left ureteric obstruction for days d untreated n and d ds n groups and days d untreated n and d ds n groups
7027,d ds and d ds received intramuscular diclofenac sodium mg kg per day during the time of obstruction whereas d untreated and d untreated groups did not receive any treatment
7028,the renal functions of both kidneys were studied weeks following the reversal
7029,the basal heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were similar in d untreated and d ds and in d untreated and d ds groups

7036,similarly there was no difference in the tubular functions
7037,treatment with diclofenac sodium during a relatively long period of reversible unilateral ureteric obstruction similar to its use in the management of ureteric colic appears to ameliorate the alterations in the hemodynamic glomerular functions at least weeks following the reversal of obstruction
7038,the inclusion complex of diclofenac sodium dcfna and beta cyclodextrin betacd was prepared and analyzed by using raman and sers spectroscopy
7039,the interaction between dcfna and betacd molecules was evidenced by monitoring the change in the peak positions and the widths of some guest molecule bands relative to those observed in the spectra of the free compound and dcfna betacd physical mixture
7040,raman data have shown that the interaction between the guest and host molecules in the dcfna betacd complex is maintained both through the dichlorophenyl ring and the phenylacetate group
7041,ser spectra revealed that depending on the ph value of the solution different isomeric forms of the guest host complex are preferentially adsorbed on the silver surface via the nonbonding electrons of the oxygen atom
7042,the orientation of the adsorbed species with respect to the metal surface was also elucidated
7043,patients with symptoms of acute renal colic were treated with diclofenac natrium
7044,according to preliminary results this drug is more effective for relieving pain of acute renal colic than the traditional combination of spasmolytics and analgetics
7045,this might be due to the blocking effect of diclofenac natrium on the renal pg synthesis and release thus decreasing the diuresis
7046,side effects were minimal as nausea vomiting etc
7047,authors highly recommend this drug as the first choice of treatment in acute renal colic

7055,there are more small myelinated fibers microm in the acupuncture group than in the medicine and control groups p
7056,the results revealed and confirmed that acupuncture promotes nerve regeneration diclofenac sodium did not show such an effect
7057,the present study demonstrates the positive effect of acupuncture on regeneration of a crushed sciatic nerve in the rabbits
7058,and acupuncture is a better treatment for regeneration of crushed nerve than diclofenac sodium
7059,we made a tpd ophthalmic solution by combining tropicamide solution mydrin p t phenylephrine hydrochloride neosynesin kowa p and diclofenac sodium diclod d and evaluated its efficiency in mydriasis during cataract surgery compared to t p and d

7072,somministrations with topical infiltration of a fans diclofenac sodium based on a new therapeutic scheme were carried on by the authors
7073,reduction of postoperative compliances and no side or general effects were noted
7074,we evaluated the effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren drops on patients with hypoxia induced corneal edema
7075,thirty age and sex matched subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups
7076,members of each group received masked solutions of either voltaren voltaren vehicle or a non preserved lubricant cellufresh every hours for hours and then hourly for hours immediately prior to inducing corneal edema in the experimental eye
7077,bilateral ultrasonic pachymetry was performed prior to applying a thick contact lens and light patch on the experimental eye of all subjects for hours
7078,the fellow eye served as the control
7079,following lens removal bilateral corneal thickness was measured every minutes
7080,the percentage change in corneal swelling for each subject and group was calculated
7081,the findings were also normalized to the control eye to minimize diurnal and individual variability
7082,the results were plotted both as percentage change from hour and percentage change normalized to the control eye
7083,corneal swelling ranged from in all groups with recovery at hours
7084,no significant difference was found among the three groups p anova
7085,there was a slight trend toward reduced thickness in the cellufresh group but this was not statistically significant
7086,voltaren does not appear to have an effect on the hypoxia induced corneal edema associated with the production of arachidonic acid pathway metabolites
7087,a new oral dosage form of diclofenac sodium enabling the single administration of the daily dose of mg has been tested for treatment of patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the spine
7088,a control group of patients with the same diagnosis instead received enteric coated tablets day each containing mg of the drug
7089,treatments lasted in both groups one month
7090,clinical efficacy was monitored by evaluating the changes in the disease s symptoms and signs pain cramps alterations of function capacity morning stiffness and in some laboratory parameters esr c reactive protein rheuma test
7091,treatment tolerability was evaluated through the routine laboratory blood and urine tests and by registering any complaint at the gastrointestinal level as well as any adverse event
7092,the two posology schemes were equally effective in favourably reducing the disease s clinical and laboratory manifestations
7093,also systemic and local tolerability were superimposable and on the whole good only a few episodes of mild epigastralgia were reported cases in each group as expected during a treatment course with nsaids
7094,diclofenac sodium voltaren prevents surgically induced miosis during extracapsular cataract extraction in a more long lasting way than indomethacin indocid
7095,just before the iol implantation in eyes treated with diclofenac sodium eye drops the apparent mean pupil size was constricted by approximately mm less than in the control group p
7096,at the same critical moment of the pupils treated with diclofenac sodium and only of the pupils in the control and indomethacin groups were larger than mm
7097,in this study an investigation of a model drug sorption onto cationic surfactant modified natural zeolites as a drug formulation excipient was performed
7098,natural zeolite was modified with cetylpyridinium chloride in amounts equivalent to and of its external cation exchange capacity
7099,the starting material and obtained organozeolites were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy zeta potential measurements and thermal analysis
7100,in vitro sorption of diclofenac sodium as a model drug was studied for all surfactant zeolite composites by means of sorption isotherm measurements in aqueous solutions ph
7101,the modified zeolites with three levels of surfactant coverage within the short activation time were prepared
7102,zeta potential measurements and thermal analysis showed that when the surfactant loading level was equal to external cation exchange value almost monolayer of organic phase were present at the zeolitic surface while higher amounts of surfactant produced less extended bilayers ordered bilayers or admicelles at the zeolitic surface
7103,modified zeolites obtained in this manner were effective in diclofenac sodium sorption and the organic phase derived from adsorbed cetylpyridinium chloride was the primary sorption phase for the model drug
7104,the langmuir isotherm was found to describe the equilibrium sorption data well over the entire concentration range
7105,the separate contributions of the adsorption and partition to the total sorption of ds were analyzed mathematically
7106,results revealed that that adsorption and partitioning of the model drug take place simultaneously
7107,to study the effect of a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory drug as an alternative to topical steroids for postoperative control of inflammation in cataract surgery
7108,the effect of diclofenac sodium following cataract surgery was studied and compared to routine corticosteroid dexamethasone phosphate in a prospective double blind randomized study
7109,both groups were similar in baseline parameters
7110,postoperative inflammatory response intraocular pressure and best corrected visual acuity following standard extracapsular cataract extraction were assessed in both groups in the initial days and the severity of these parameters was graded
7111,the severity of postoperative inflammatory response to the two drugs was graded at and days
7112,intraocular pressure and visual acuity at baseline and endpoint were compared and statistically analyzed
7113,the two groups did not differ statistically in treatment effect for any of the variables including aqueous cells flare ciliary congestion descemet s folds visual acuity and intraocular pressure p
7114,however there seemed to be a trend towards quicker improvement with corticosteroid when cells in the anterior chamber were considered
7115,there were no side effects from topical diclofenac and it was well tolerated
7116,diclofenac sodium is as effective as topical corticosteroid and can be used as an alternative in routine postoperative treatment following uncomplicated cataract surgery
7117,upper gastrointestinal tract complications due to non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are well recognised
7118,however adverse effects on large intestinal mucosa are less common and less well recognised even though they carry a significant morbidity and mortality
7119,here we report a case of colonic perforation in a healthy woman without any underlying colonic pathology associated with ingestion of slow release diclofenac sodium
7120,the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of terminalia arjuna ta on diclofenac sodium induced gastric ulcer in experimental rats
7121,animals were induced for gastric ulcer with diclofenac sodium dic mg kg bodyweight in water orally and treated orally with ta in various doses ranging from mg kg bodyweight to mg kg bodyweight
7122,the effective dose was mg kg bodyweight since this dose elicited a maximum reduction in lesion index
7123,the gastroprotective effect of ta was assessed from volume of gastric juice ph free and total acidity pepsin concentration acid output in gastric juice the levels of non protein sulfhydryls np sh lipid peroxide lpo reduced glutathione gsh and activities of enzymic antioxidants super oxide dismutase sod catalase cat glutathione peroxidase gpx glutathione s transferase gst and myeloperoxidase mpo in gastric mucosa
7124,the levels of dna protein bound carbohydrate complexes hexose hexoseamine sialic acid fucose in gastric mucosa and gastric juice and the levels of rna in gastric mucosa were assessed
7125,the stomach tissues were used for adherent mucus content and also for the histological examination
7126,a significant reduction in lesion index was observed in ulcer induced animals treated with ta dic ta compared to ulcerated rats dic
7127,a significant increase was observed in ph np sh gsh enzymic antioxidants protein bound carbohydrate complexes adherent mucus content nucleic acids with a significant decrease in volume of gastric juice free and total acidity pepsin concentration acid output lpo levels and mpo activities in dic ta rats compared to dic rats
7128,histological studies confirmed the gastroprotective activity of ta
7129,from the data presented in this study it could be concluded that t arjuna acts as an gastroprotective agent probably due to its free radical scavenging activity and cytoprotective nature
7130,fourty adult patients with coxarthrosis were treated for days with oral diclofenac sodium at the daily dose of mg of these were administered one mg prolonged release capsule per day the other received one mg enteric coated tablet every hours
7131,the presence and severity of several symptoms and signs various pain types cramps morning stiffness impaired function capacity the intensity of pain through the visual analogical scale and some laboratory tests erythrocyte sedimentation rate c reactive protein rheuma test were controlled to monitor drug efficacy
7132,the routine laboratory tests of blood liver and kidney function the gastrointestinal tolerance of the two administered formulations and the appearance of any adverse event were controlled to monitor drug tolerability
7133,both administration schemes yielded very positive results as to treatment efficacy although the prolonged release capsule often induced a somewhat quicker response
7134,at the end of the one month treatment more than half of patients in both groups registered disappearance of several symptoms and a noticeable reduction of the remainder ones
7135,systemic tolerability was also good with superimposable results in the two groups gastrointestinal tolerance on the contrary was better in the recipients of the prolonged release capsules cases of dyspepsia with respect to those treated with the enteric coated tablets cases of gastric pyrosis and cases of gastralgia
7136,no adverse events were registered
7137,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs have dose related adverse effects
7138,topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs may offer local efficacy with low systemic drug levels
7139,this study assessed the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac sodium gel dsg in mild to moderate symptomatic knee osteoarthritis
7140,in a randomized double blind vehicle controlled trial adults aged or years with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis of or months duration were randomized to dsg g n or vehicle n times daily for weeks
7141,primary efficacy outcomes at week were the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index womac pain subscale womac physical function subscale and global rating of disease
7142,secondary outcomes included these outcomes assessed after and weeks and pain on movement assessed using a mm visual analog scale
7143,all adverse events were recorded
7144,at week the dsg group had significant decreases versus the vehicle group in mean womac pain p mean womac physical function p and mean global rating of disease p
7145,efficacy outcomes significantly favored dsg versus vehicle beginning at week application site reactions occurred in and of patients in the dsg and vehicle groups respectively
7146,the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders was with dsg and with vehicle
7147,over a month treatment period topical treatment with dsg achieved statistically and clinically significant improvements of pain and measures of physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis
7148,the effects of diclofenac sodium dfna combined with dionine in cases with fibrin exudation membrane on intraocular lens iol were studied
7149,thirty two eyes derived from sixteen adult pure bred new zealand rabbits were divided at random into two groups after extracapsular lens extraction with posterior chamber iol implantation rabbits received dfna eyedrops combined with dionine eyedrops rabbits received pred forte eyedrops
7150,the sum of fibrinous exudation membrane on iol was observed on d postoperation
7151,the fibrin exudations in the dfna combined with dionine group is less than the pred forte group p
7152,dfna combined with dionine is effective in treating fibrin exudation membrane after extracapsular lens extraction and iol implantation and it is more effective than the pred forte
7153,recently coated pellets have gained attention of the pharmaceutical industry as they represent a relatively easy way leading to controlled drug release
7154,pellets of appropriate properties containing approx
7155,of diclofenac sodium were prepared by roto agglomeration
7156,for the coating two different aqueous dispersions surelease and eudragit rs d were selected
7157,generally the drug release rate slowed down as the coating load increased from to
7158,however big differences between diclofenac sodium release from pellets coated with surelease and eudragit rs d at equivalent coating loads were observed
7159,although eudragit rs d provided membranes successfully controlling drug release over an extended period of hours the coating process with surelease led to a film of a very poor quality
7160,faster release from ethyl cellulose coated pellets could be explained in terms of a higher solubility of diclofenac sodium in alkaline aqueous dispersion of ethyl cellulose and its migration into the coat during the coating process and or the unsatisfactory curing of the ethyl cellulose film
7161,therefore possible interactions between the coating and the drug should be always considered as suggested in this study
7162,both the potential analgesic effects and side effects of topical diclofenac sodium are points of interest after excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy
7163,excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy was performed in eyes of patients
7164,in eyes patients the effects of topical diclofenac given three times a day for to days were compared to a control group of eyes patients
7165,all patients received paracetamol for systemic analgesia and were patched after surgery until reepithelialization
7166,twenty eight patients of the diclofenac group needed additional systemic analgesics compared to patients in the control group
7167,seventy two hours after surgery we found no significant differences in corneal epithelial wound healing and no severe complications
7168,topical diclofenac sodium reduces postoperative pain in patients after phototherapeutic keratectomy
7169,we compared the postoperative anti inflammatory effect of diclofenac sodium and dexamethasone phosphate in a prospective randomized double masked pilot study
7170,anterior chamber inflammation was evaluated by measuring aqueous flare and cells with a laser flare cell meter at one three and days after cataract surgery
7171,flare values in the two groups did not significantly differ at any time nor did aqueous cell counts at one three and days after surgery
7172,at days however cell count was significantly lower in the diclofenac group
7173,diclofenac sodium seems to be as potent as dexamethasone phosphate as good as anti inflammatory agent and may replace corticosteroid therapy after cataract surgery
7174,microspheres of chitosan crosslinked with three different crosslinking agents viz glutaraldehyde sulphuric acid and heat treatment have been prepared to encapsulate diclofenac sodium ds
7175,chitosan microspheres are produced in a w o emulsion followed by crosslinking in the water phase by one of the crosslinking methods
7176,encapsulation of ds has been carried out by soaking the already swollen crosslinked microspheres in a saturated solution of ds
7177,microspheres are further characterized by ftir x rd and sem
7178,the in vitro release studies are performed in ph buffer solution
7179,microspheres produced are spherical and have smooth surfaces with sizes ranging between microm as evidenced by sem
7180,the crosslinking of chitosan takes place at the free amino group in all the cases as evidenced by ftir
7181,this leads to the formation of imine groups or ionic bonds
7182,polymer crystallinity increases after crosslinking as determined by x rd
7183,the method adopted for drug loading into the microspheres is satisfactory and up to w w loading is observed for the sulphuric acid crosslinked microspheres whereas and of loadings are obtained for the glutaraldehyde ga and heat crosslinked microspheres respectively
7184,among all the systems studied the ga crosslinked microspheres have shown the sloxvest release i e
7185,at min and a fastest release of at min is shown by heat crosslinking for h drug release from the matrices deviates slightly from the fickian process
7186,this study was performed to develop a topical ointment of diclofenac na which has a potent anti inflammatory activity by oral administration
7187,at first research was carried out on the ointment base which influences the external anti inflammatory effect of the drug
7188,ointments of diclofenac na were prepared with three kinds of bases lipophilic emulsion cream and gel bases and their anti inflammatory effects were compared
7189,the cream was found to have the most potent effect
7190,therefore in the next experiment an optimum concentration of diclofenac na in cream was determined comparing the anti inflammatory effect among the cream preparations containing and of the drug
7191,obvious effects were observed with the cream containing and of the drug concentration and there was no significant difference in the anti inflammatory activities of these two concentrations
7192,based on these results the cream preparation containing of diclofenac na df cream was adopted as the external ointment of the drug
7193,the anti inflammatory effect of this cream was compared with that of existing anti inflammatory ointments i e indomethacin gel im gel bufexamac cream bm cream and mobilat ointment ml ointment
7194,df cream produced obvious inhibition on increased vascular permeability and on acute edema and remarkable suppression of ultraviolet erythema
7195,these activities of df cream were similar to those of im gel and more potent than those of bm cream and ml ointment
7196,the inhibitory effect of df cream on the proliferation of granulation tissue was almost equal to that of ml ointment and more distinguishable than that of im gel and bm cream
7197,in adjuvant arthritis df cream reduced the swelling remarkably in the treated paw and slightly in the untreated paw
7198,the anti adjuvant activity of df cream was equal to that of im gel and more potent than that of bm cream and ml ointment
7199,in pain to pressure stimulation an analgesic effect was observed in the early stage of df cream application and its activity was slightly stronger than that of the other ointments
7200,these results show that df cream has an obvious anti inflammatory effect as an external preparation and the activity is comparable or superior to that of similar existing anti inflammatory ointments
7201,this cream may be considered as useful in the clinical field as a topical anti inflammatory preparation
7202,a comparative bioavailability study and in vitro characterization were conducted on two commercial products of diclofenac sodium voltaren a and inflaban b in the form of enteric coated tablets and mg
7203,the two products were found similar in weight variation and content uniformity and both met the british pharmacopeia requirements of disintegration for enteric coated tablets
7204,the dissolution in vitro revealed that product b was characterized by a faster rate compared to product a the bioavailability of single doses x and x mg of each product was carried out respectively on and normal male volunteers according to a randomized complete block design
7205,blood samples were obtained over a hour interval and serum concentrations of the drug were determined using an hplc assay
7206,the two products were found bioequivalent as assessed by auc
7207,however the tmax value was found to be significantly smaller for product b compared to product a indicating that product b is apparently absorbed at a faster rate
7208,further product b was characterized by higher cmax values although these were not statistically different from the corresponding values of product a these findings are consistent with the in vitro dissolution pattern of the two products and the differences in the rate of absorption may have therapeutic implications
7209,in a random cross over study eight healthy volunteers received single mg doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium tablets as either voltaren ciba geigy or anfenax istituto biochimico italiano after an overnight fast
7210,the bioavailability of these two preparations of diclofenac sodium did not differ significantly as judged by absorption lag time peak plasma concentration time to peak plasma concentrations or area under the plasma concentration time curve
7211,diclofenac was found to have a plasma clearance of s d
7212,and ml min kg a plasma terminal half life of elimination of and h and an apparent volume of distribution of and l kg the values obtained with the ciba geigy preparation being shown before the istituto biochimico italiano preparation in each case
7213,reye syndrome rs is an acute encephalopathy in childhood and is very rare in adulthood
7214,here we report a year old woman with rs
7215,because of her dysmenorrhea she took tablets of diclofenac sodium mg per day in divided doses for two days
7216,two days after the last intake of the medicine she developed high fever nausea vomiting and disturbance of consciousness with delirium i e acute encephalopathy
7217,she did not have seizure hemiplegia or other focal neurological manifestations
7218,the serum got level was normal at onset but in hours dramatically increased up to iu l
7219,the serum bilirubin level was normal
7220,the cerebrospinal fluid revealed normal cell count and protein
7221,although the liver biopsy was not performed because of thrombocytopenia we diagnosed her as an adult case of rs according to the clinical criteria of the center for disease control
7222,in addition to treatment for the brain edema plasma exchange was performed once treat the encephalopathy at the onset
7223,the next day her consciousness level and serum got level markedly improved
7224,she completely recovered from acute encephalopathy in a week after her admission
7225,in conclusion diclofenac sodium as well as aspirin should be considered as a possible causal agent for rs and early plasma exchange may be beneficial
7226,we refer the results of an open non comparative study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of diclofenac sodium in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile chronic arthritis
7227,we decided to use this drug to investigate if it exerts also in younger patients the anti inflammatory and analgesic effects known in adults
7228,we treated patients girls and boys aged years the disease duration ranged between months and years
7229,treatment was started only if previous anti inflammatory drugs had been considered ineffective after a prolonged use months
7230,none was on basic therapy
7231,no wash out period was used for ethical reasons
7232,during the trial period other additional symptomatic or anti inflammatory drugs were not used
7233,diclofenac sodium was given by tablets and or suppositories at the mean daily dosage of mg kg min
7235,according to disease activity for a period of months
7236,diclofenac sodium was particularly effective on joint pain and morning stiffness but also on joint swelling and functional capacity
7237,we noticed a tendency of jra to improve during the trial period
7238,the drug was well tolerated one patient stopped because of headache another continued the treatment only per os because of intolerance of rectal administration
7239,unacceptable side effects involved in topical steroid usage for uveitis have prompted the search for alternative antiinflammatory drugs for the treatment of ocular inflammation
7240,cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been widely used for systemic inflammatory conditions over the last two decades and are therefore natural candidates to be studied for uveitis therapy
7241,previous studies of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in uveitis models yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradicting results
7242,the authors compared the clinical effect of topical dexamethasone diclofenac and placebo in an immunogenic uveitis model produced in ovalbumin immunized nzw rabbits challenged with ovalbumin in the vitreous
7243,nine clinical parameters of inflammation were compared employing a double blind placebo controlled protocol
7244,three groups of eyes each were assigned for each preparation and were followed for nine days with biomicroscopic examinations
7245,diclofenac was superior or equal to dexamethasone for iris hyperemia p and conjunctival injection p equal for corneal haziness and ac fibrin yet inferior for corneal endothelial debris iris fibrin and ac cells and flare p
7246,placebo was inferior p to the other groups for the above mentioned parameters excluding fibrin precipitation on the iris that was greater in diclofenac treated eyes
7247,while some clinical criteria of inflammation responded better to steroids than to diclofenac the results of this study show that others responded better or equal to diclofenac
7248,the authors hypothesize that although diclofenac reduces prostaglandin levels it may induce high levels of leukotrienes that maintain cellular exudation
7249,the aim of this randomized double blind clinical trial was to investigate the effect of preemptive analgesia with a combination of tramadol dexamethasone or tramadol diclofenac sodium
7250,the study included patients age range years who were randomly assigned to groups by the split mouth method

7252,swelling was measured at p o h
7253,maximal interincisor distance was measured at p o h
7254,and postoperative days p o d
7255,significant differences in postoperative pain intensity were detected between the drug combinations at and p o h suggesting the importance of preemptive analgesia
7256,patients treated with tramadol dexamethasone showed lower pain scores compared to the tramadol diclofenac sodium combination larger postoperative mouth opening and less swelling
7257,the tramadol dexamethasone combination also was more effective than tramadol diclofenac sodium at reducing inflammation
7258,cataract is the leading cause of blindness throughout the world
7259,this prospective study was conducted in the department of ophthalmology mymensingh medical college hospital
7260,patients of both sexes of to years of age range admitted for cataract surgery were selected for this study
7261,patients were randomly selected during the period june to december with age related cataract
7262,total patients were included in the study dividing into two groups
7263,in group a patients were treated with diclofenac sodium eye drop drop times daily for days after cataract surgery
7264,in group b patients were treated with prednisolone acetate eye drop drop hourly week drop hourly for weeks than drop hourly for days after cataract surgery
7265,male were and female were in both groups a b post operative inflammation were evaluated by slit lamp examination of cells flares keratic precipitate kp
7266,patients were evaluated on st th and th postoperative day
7267,anterior chamber cells were found in grade i in grade ii in grade iii of group a and in grade i in grade ii in grade iii patients of group b in st visit
7268,anterior chamber cells reduce in nd visit in final visit anterior chamber cells were absent in patients in group a patients in group b
7269,anterior chamber flares were found in in grade i in grade ii patients in grade iii of group a in grade i in grade ii in grade iii of group b in st visit
7270,anterior chamber flares reduce in both groups in nd visit
7271,in final visit anterior chamber flares absent patients in group a patients in group b
7272,kp were found patients in grade i of group a patients in grade i of group b
7273,in nd visit kp reduced in both groups in final visit kp were absent in patients of group a patients of group b
7274,analysis shows no significant difference in cells flares and kp in both groups
7275,visual acuity with pin hole at final visit in group a had had had had and in group b had had had and had
7276,visual outcome were good in both the groups
7277,no statistical significant difference was found between two groups
7278,at each visit there was no statistically significant difference of post operative inflammation between two groups of patients
7279,a sensitive and fast flow injection spectrophotometric method for the determination of diclofenac sodium based on the formation of coloured compound with ce iv methyl benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride mbth in hso x m medium is proposed
7280,using the peak height as a quantitative parameter diclofenac was determined at nm over the range micrograms ml
7281,the proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of diclofenac in pharmaceuticals and urine samples
7282,this study was performed to compare the efficacy safety and tolerability of diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution with that of prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension for treatment of inflammation following phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implantation
7283,one hundred and sixteen patients diclofenac prednisolone with visually disabling cataract were enrolled in this prospective randomised double masked parallel group study in two centres
7284,post operative patient assessments at day and included visual acuity slit lamp examination applanation tonometry and subjective evaluation of local tolerance
7285,there was no statistically significant difference between the diclofenac and predisolone groups in the sum of the grades of anterior chamber flare and cells or the degree of conjunctival hyperaemia at any study visit
7286,the overall assessment of local tolerance was similar for both the study medications
7287,there were two possibly drug related adverse events in the prednisolone group but neither was severe
7288,diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution was as effective safe and well tolerated overall as prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension
7289,to assess the clinical efficacy of chondroitin sulfate cs in comparison with the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid diclofenac sodium ds in a medium longterm clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis oa
7290,this was a randomized multicenter double blind double dummy study
7291,patients with knee oa were recruited into groups
7292,during the first month patients in the nsaid group were treated with x mg ds tablets day and x mg placebo for cs sachets from month to month patients were given placebo sachets alone
7293,in the cs group patients were treated with x mg placebo for diclofenac tablets day and x mg cs sachets day during the first month from month to month these patients received only cs sachets
7294,both groups were treated with x mg placebo sachets from month to month clinical efficacy was evaluated by assessing the lequesne index spontaneous pain using the huskisson visual analog scale pain on load using a point ordinal scale and paracetamol consumption
7295,patients treated with the nsaid showed prompt and plain reduction of clinical symptoms which however reappeared after the end of treatment in the cs group the therapeutic response appeared later in time but lasted for up to months after the end of treatment
7296,cs seems to have slow but gradually increasing clinical activity in oa these benefits last for a long period after the end of treatment
7297,nsaids nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are a class of drugs with analgesic anti inflammatory and antipyretic effects
7298,diclofenac sodium is one of the world s most widely prescribed nsaids
7299,meloxicam is another nsaid that was approved in the last several years
7300,treatment with nsaids may result in renal damage
7301,relatively little is known about comparative nephrotoxicity of nsaids
7302,therefore the present study was designed to compare the adverse effects of diclofenac sodium and meloxicam on renal tissue in rats
7303,forty eight wistar male rats were randomly assigned into groups of animals each
7304,group c served as normal control and received normal saline
7305,group d and m received diclofenac sodium mg kg day and meloxicam mg kg day respectively
7306,after days all rats were scarified
7307,their kidneys were then harvested and processed for histological examination
7308,in addition to cellular details renal tubular count and diameter were assessed with the light microscope
7309,the data were analyzed using spss software
7310,we found that the mean number of renal tubules was significantly lower in group d than in group c moreover the mean renal tubular diameter was significantly higher in group d than in group c the present study showed that a considerable degree of nephrotoxicity resulted from diclofenac sodium compared to meloxicam
7311,we suggest that diclofenac sodium can be replaced with meloxicam
7312,a randomized prospective double blind study of the analgesic effect of mg intramuscular diclofenac sodium voltaren a potent prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor versus placebo saline solution was carried out in consecutive patients with acute ureteral colic
7313,diclofenac provided complete relief of pain minutes after the injection in of the cases while placebo provided relief in p less than
7314,forty patients in the placebo group and seventeen patients in the diclofenac group needed an open injection of mg diclofenac intramuscularly after minutes due to persistent pain
7315,fifty four of the fifty seven patients treated with an open injection of diclofenac achieved complete relief of pain after minutes
7316,there were no side effects of the treatment
7317,even though conventional pharmacotherapy has been demonstrated to display very efficient activity against a wide variety of diseases several active agents e g anti tumor drugs and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are generally needed to be administered at high doses to elicit the required therapeutic action simultaneously leading to severe side effects
7318,this fact is usually due to unfavourable pharmacokinetic profiles poor biological half life and to the possibility of induction of resistance
7319,in order to increase the therapeutic activity of ftorafur and diclofenac sodium along with an overcome of their important drawbacks we investigated their formulation into a colloidal carrier based on the biodegradable polymer poly epsilon caprolactone
7320,two drug loading methods were studied i surface adsorption in already formed nanoparticles after incubation in a drug solution ii drug addition before interfacial polymer disposition leading to drug entrapment into the polymeric network
7321,we hypothesized that such nanocarrier possessed very significant characteristics e g unusually high drug loading and low burst release suggesting their potential application for efficient drug delivery to targeted sites
7322,to examine the effects of prolonged systemic administration of diclofenac sodium voltaren a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug on objective indices of exercise induced muscle damage in humans
7323,fifty four volunteers mean age yr range participated in this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial
7324,to achieve steady state tissue levels either placebo or diclofenac was orally administered two times a day for consecutive days
7325,a strenuous min stepping exercise program about which the subjects were unfamiliar was conducted on day creatine kinase ck activities were measured immediately before the exercise session and on days and vastus lateralis muscle samples were obtained immediately before exercise and on day for subsequent histological characterization of muscle inflammation
7326,the preexercise muscle samples revealed no difference in muscle damage between the two groups
7327,however the postexercise muscle samples showed that the diclofenac treated group demonstrated less muscle tissue damage than placebo treated subjects p
7328,the administration of diclofenac also resulted in a significant lowering of post pre exercise ck ratios on days p and p compared with the placebo group an indirect finding that supports the possibility of diclofenac reducing exercise induced muscle damage
7329,these findings demonstrate preadministration of diclofenac in accordance with tissue half life pharmacokinetics significantly reduces quantitative indices of exercise induced skeletal muscle damage in human muscle
7330,two hundred and fifty children undergoing herniotomy or orchidopexy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive pre operatively either diclofenac sodium mg kg given intramuscularly or a caudal injection of bupivacaine ml kg with or without adrenaline or no analgesia
7331,plasma diclofenac and beta endorphin concentrations were determined in eight and patients respectively
7332,postoperative pain was assessed by ward nurses who were blinded to the group allocation
7333,comparison with the control group showed diclofenac to be an effective analgesic
7334,caudal bupivacaine provided more pain free children during the early postoperative hours but later the need for pethidine as rescue analgesic was lower among the children who had received intramuscular diclofenac
7335,caudal analgesia abolished the stress induced increase in plasma beta endorphin level which was found in the children given diclofenac and in those who served as controls
7336,total plasma clearance of intramuscular diclofenac sodium appears to be higher in children than in adults
7337,a single intramuscular dose of diclofenac significantly reduces the need for an opioid analgesic in children after inguinal herniotomy or orchidopexy and owing to its long duration of action it offers an alternative or complementary method of pain relief to caudal analgesia
7338,this double blind clinical trial compares droxicam a new non steroidal anti inflammatory agent and the reference compound diclofenac sodium
7339,after a day placebo run in period patients with gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis were randomized to receive mg day of droxicam and mg day of diclofenac for weeks
7340,evaluations were carried out at weeks placebo run in and both drugs showed statistically significant improvements in all clinical measurements index of severity pain intensity morning stiffness maximal forced flexion and extension of the knee after weeks of treatment
7341,investigator s and patient s opinions were consistent with these results
7342,the consumption of paracetamol was significantly lower amongst patients treated with droxicam
7343,withdrawals due to lack of therapeutic efficacy did not occur
7344,a lower incidence of side effects mostly upper gastrointestinal symptoms was noticed amongst droxicam treated patients
7345,however two patients in the droxicam group were withdrawn at week and two days after week because of epigastric pain and nausea and cutaneous rash respectively
7346,both study drugs are of benefit in reducing pain and improving joint motion and function in patients with coxarthrosis and gonarthrosis
7347,sustained release matrix pellets loaded with w w diclofenac sodium ds were prepared using extrusion spheronization technique
7348,different polyethylene glycols pegs of different molecular weight namely peg peg and peg were mixed with avicel ph in different weight ratios to manufacture the pellet formulations and water was used as a binder
7349,mix torque rheomter was used to characterize the pellets wet mass
7350,also the prepared pellets were characterized for their particle sizes ds content shape and morphology as well as the in vitro drug release
7351,the results showed that increasing peg weight ratio resulted in a reduction of wet mass torque as well as binder ratio especially at peg high weight ratios and and the extent of lowering wet mass peak torque was inversely proportional to peg molecular weight
7352,the manufactured pellets exhibited size range of to m with small span values
7353,the drug release from pellets was governed by the molecular weight of peg used since increasing peg molecular weight resulted in slowing the drug release rate from pellets but increasing its level resulted in enhancing release rate
7354,this was attributed to increasing pellet wet mass peak torque by increasing peg molecular weight and lowering it by increasing peg level
7355,the prepared pellets showed non fickian or anomalous drug release or the coupled diffusion polymer relaxation
7356,we investigated the interaction of diclofenac sodium dic na with bovine serum albumin bsa in the absence and presence of urea using different spectroscopic techniques
7357,a fluorescence quenching study revealed that the stern volmer quenching constant decreases in the presence of urea decreasing further at higher urea concentrations
7358,the binding constant and number of binding sites were also evaluated for the bsa dic na interaction system in the absence and presence of urea using a modified stern volmer equation
7359,the binding constant is greater at high urea concentrations as shown by the fluorescence results
7360,in addition for the bsa dic na interaction system a static quenching mechanism was observed which was further confirmed using time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
7361,uv vis spectroscopy provided information about the formation of a complex between bsa and dic na
7362,circular dichroism was carried out to explain the conformational changes in bsa induced by dic na in the absence and presence of urea
7363,the presence of urea reduced the helical content of bsa as the dic na concentration varied
7364,the distance r between the donor bsa and acceptor dic na was also obtained in the absence and presence of urea using fluorescence resonance energy transfer

7366,matrix tablets comprising of a blend of cellulose acetate butyrate cab or cellulose acetate propionate cap and alpha lactose monohydrate were prepared by direct compression to control the release of diclofenac sodium
7367,tablet formulations containing cap or cab exhibited highest extents but lowest onsets of plastic deformation and lowest release rates in buffer medium while tablets containing cap or cab exhibited lowest extents but highest rates of plastic deformation and highest release rates in buffer medium
7368,the da values obtained from heckel plots and the di values obtained from kawakita plots showed similar trends
7369,a plot of compression pressure or crushing strengths against t showed curvilinear relationship for all tablets
7370,tablets containing cab formulation fd was considered the best formulation in terms of t compressibility and compactability
7371,nir spectroscopy together with multivariate data analysis were used to analyze the hydrates of diclofenac sodium prepared from the non aqueous solvents tetrahydrofuran and methanol under standard laboratory conditions at c and relative humidity less than
7372,it was confirmed that the developed pls regression model can monitor the process of formation of hydrates
7373,it was also found that the hydrated form of diclofenac sodium arises during the preparation of the dosage form the using technology of impregnating the solid carrier by non aqueous solvents which resulted in reducing of the drug release rate from prepared tablets up to twice
7374,nir spectroscopy was confirmed as one of the effective pat process analytical technology methods
7375,a novel spherical magnetic nanocarrier of nm dimensions made of pectin interacted with chitosan mpch ds resulted in encapsulation efficiency of diclofenac sodium ds as a model drug
7376,similarly magnetic nanocarrier made of only pectin crosslinked with ca mpds resulted in only encapsulation efficiency of ds
7377,the increase in drug encapsulation efficiency in mpch ds batch was due to synergistic drug encapsulation properties of pectin and chitosan
7378,the structural and morphological features of these magnetic nanocarriers were studied by x ray diffractometry xrd fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir thermogravimetry electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering dls measurements
7379,the magnetic properties were measured by vibrating sample magnetometer vsm and superconducting quantum unit interference device measurements squid
7380,the in vitro drug release was ph sensitive and exhibited sustained release sequentially in simulated gastric fluid negligible release in h simulated intestinal fluid release in h simulated colonic fluid h and also in phosphate buffer at ph h
7381,the drug release profile in phosphate buffer solution at ph was in good agreement with swelling controlled mechanism on the basis of korsemeyer peppas model
7382,a factorial design was employed to produce controlled release solid dispersions of diclofenac sodium in eudragit rs and rl by coevaporation of their ethanol solution in a flash evaporator
7383,the effect of critical formulation variables namely total polymer pay loads and levels of eudragit rl on percent drug incorporation di drug release at the end of hours rel and drug release at the end of hours rel were analyzed using response surface methodology
7384,the parameters were evaluated using the f test and mathematical models containing only the significant terms were generated for each parameter using multiple linear regression analysis and analysis of variance
7385,both the formulation variables studied exerted a significant influence p on the drug release whereas the total polymer levels emerged as a lone factor significantly influencing the percent drug incorporation
7386,numerical optimization technique employing desirability approach was used to develop a new formulation by setting constraints on the dependent and independent variables
7387,the experimental values of di rel and rel for the optimized batch were found to be and respectively which were in close agreement with those predicted by the mathematical models
7388,the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry and powder x ray diffractometry confirmed that the drug was reduced to molecular or microcrystalline form in the hydrophobic polymeric matrices which could be responsible for the controlled drug release from the solid dispersions
7389,the drug release from the solid dispersions followed first order rate kinetics and was characterized by higuchian diffusion model
7390,the main objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model for the characterization of diclofenac sodium diffusion from polyethylene oxide peo matrices
7391,a model was developed on the basis of the diffusion theory accounting for the characteristics of the polymer swelling with subsequent dissolution in water
7392,the concentration dependent diffusion of drug and water was taken into account
7393,experimental data were analysed using a computer software program as an aid for solving partial differential equations
7394,six formulations of matrix tablets with different drug excipient ratios were prepared using low molecular weight peo as a matrix forming material
7395,for obtaining drug release data dissolution studies were performed and water uptake by pure peo matrices was studied as well
7396,a good agreement of the developed model with experimental results was demonstrated
7397,some anomalies in drug diffusion were observed and their origin was questioned
7398,changes in the parameters characterizing the process of diffusion are attributed to glassy rubbery polymer transitions
7399,additional interpretation of this phenomenon on the basis of percolation theory is also provided
7400,the obtained model has the ability to predict the required characteristics of matrices for desired drug release
7401,the composition of batches with undesirable release properties can be predetermined and avoided in manufacturing
7402,the technique of solution calorimetry has been employed to study the interaction between diclofenac sodium and beta cyclodextrin by determining the enthalpies of solution of the drug in water and in aqueous beta cyclodextrin solution
7403,thermodynamic parameters characterizing the binding process such as enthalpy deltah equilibrium constant k free energy deltag and entropy deltas have been calculated to be kj mol dm mol kj mol and j k mol respectively
7404,enthalpies of solution of diclofenac sodium have also been determined in water ethanol mixtures
7405,diclofenac sodium bearing magnetic erythrocytes were prepared using a preswell technique
7406,the optimum loading of drug and magnetite achieved were and per cent respectively
7407,drug loaded erythrocytes and drug loaded magnetic erythrocytes were characterized for in vitro drug and haemoglobin release magnetic responsiveness osmotic fragility turbulence shock morphology and percentage cell recovery
7408,the drug loaded magnetic erythrocytes were found less resistant to osmotic and turbulence shock when compared with the normal and drug loaded erythrocytes
7409,however in optimum concentration erythrocytes tolerated drug and coated magnetite appreciably
7410,the drug loaded magnetic erythrocytes responded effectively for an external magnetic field of koe
7411,the study suggested the potentiality of diclofenac sodium loaded magnetic erythrocytes for active delivery of drug to painful inflamed joints
7412,diclofenac sodium a phenylacetic acid derivative is a non steroidal anti inflammatory analgesic agent advocated for use in rheumatoid arthritis degenerative joint disease ankylosing spondylitis and allied conditions and in the treatment of pain resulting from minor surgery trauma and dysmenorrhoea
7413,published data indicate that diclofenac to mg daily to mg times daily is comparable in efficacy with ordinary aspirin to g daily and indomethacin to mg daily in rheumatoid arthritis and with indomethacin in osteoarthritis
7414,available data suggest that in patients with osteoarthritis diclofenac sodium is comparable in efficacy and tolerability with naproxen ibuprofen sulindac and diflunisal
7415,as oral diclofenac is generally given in divided daily doses it may be at a disadvantage relative to less frequent administration with naproxen diflunisal and sulindac in rheumatoid arthritis although there is some evidence of diclofenac s efficacy when administered twice daily or once daily as a slow release tablet
7416,the drug is also available as suppositories and ampoules for intramuscular injection
7417,no one of the non steroidal anti inflammatory agents is the most suitable drug for all patients requiring such therapy and diclofenac should be considered along with other drugs of its type in the arthritic patient
7418,a method that combines five way fluorescence kinetics with fourth order calibration for interference free quantification of diclofenac sodium in river water was proposed and tested
7419,traditional fluorescence methods may not be suitable for such measurements since the fluorescence properties of the analyte are highly dependent on both ph and irradiation time in situ
7420,in the method considered here a five way emission excitation time ph data array was obtained from the samples by introducing the ph level and irradiation time as two extra modes
7421,then the data array was resolved by three fourth order calibration algorithms alternating fitting weighted residue quinquelinear decomposition afwrqqld five way parallel factor analysis five parafac and alternating quinquelinear decomposition aqqld
7422,the average recoveries and detection limits calculated for diclofenac sodium in a set of analyte spiked river water samples using afwrqqld five parafac and aqqld were and ng ml
7423,zinc zn ion induced diclofenac sodium ds loaded alginate okra hibiscus esculentus gum og blend beads was successfully formulated through zn ion induced ionic gelation cross linking method in a complete aqueous environment

7429,these beads exhibited sustained in vitro drug release over a prolonged period of h and followed controlled release zero order pattern with super case ii transport mechanism
7430,the swelling and degradation of the optimized beads was influenced by the ph of test mediums which might be suitable for intestinal drug delivery
7431,this study evaluated the use of ultrasound in combination with the commercial anti inflammatory drugs ketoprofen and sodium diclofenac according to the parameters used in physiotherapy
7432,ketoprofen and sodium diclofenac were used in the franz diffusion cell model adapted to an ultrasound transducer in three conditions no ultrasound one application of ultrasound and two applications of ultrasound
7433,high performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify the total amount of drug permeating skin per unit area as well as flux and latency
7434,the results showed that for ketoprofen the amount of drug permeating skin and flux increased with two ultrasound applications
7435,permeation of sodium diclofenac decreased in the presence of ultrasound
7436,ultrasound parameters and drug properties must be considered in the use of phonophoresis
7437,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are associated with a dose related risk of cardiovascular renal and gastrointestinal adverse events aes
7438,topical nsaids produce lower systemic nsaid exposure compared with oral nsaids offering potential benefits
7439,to evaluate the safety of topical diclofenac sodium gel dsg for knee and hand osteoarthritis oa in older and younger patients and in patients with versus without comorbid hypertension type diabetes or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease
7440,post hoc analysis of pooled data from randomized double blind placebo controlled trials involving patients aged years with mild to moderate oa of the knee and patients aged years with mild to moderate oa of the hand
7441,patients applied g of dsg or vehicle to affected knees qid for weeks or g of dsg or vehicle to affected hands qid for weeks
7442,in patients with knee oa the percentage with adverse event was similar in patients aged years versus years and was similar in patients with versus without comorbid hypertension vs respectively type diabetes mellitus vs or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease vs
7443,in patients with hand oa the percentage with ae was similar in patients aged years versus years and was similar in patients with versus without hypertension vs respectively lower in patients with versus without type diabetes mellitus vs and higher in patients with versus without cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease vs
7444,gastrointestinal cardiovascular and renal aes were rare and did not differ according to age or comorbidity
7445,application site reactions were the primary cause for the greater frequency of aes with dsg versus vehicle
7446,the similar and low rates of aes in dsg treated patients aged years and years and in those with and without comorbid hypertension type diabetes or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease suggest that dsg treatment is generally well tolerated
7447,a procedure for the quantitative determination of diclofenac sodium ds in commercial capsules and tablets based on partial least squares pls treatment of diffuse reflectance ftir spectroscopic drifts data is described
7448,two drifts accessories a collector ii spectra tech and a seagull harrick scientific were used to collect the spectra
7449,the spectrometer beam area on the surface of the sample was approximately sevenfold smaller for the collector ii accessory compared to the seagull accessory
7450,spectra collection using the smaller beam spot resulted in significantly higher quantification errors for the single measurements
7451,to reduce the errors associated with the collector ii accessory spectra were collected seven times while randomly changing the sample position
7452,the mean spectra were used in the analysis
7453,to compare the predictive ability of the constructed models the relative standard errors of prediction rsep were calculated
7454,the rseps were and using the collector ii accessory and and using the seagull accessory for calibration and validation data sets for the different pls models
7455,three commercial preparations containing and ds were successfully quantified using the developed models
7456,the proposed procedure can be used as a fast precise and economic method for ds quantification in tablets and capsules
7457,the ft raman quantification of diclofenac sodium in tablets and capsules was performed with the help of the partial least squares pls principal component regression pcr and counter propagation artificial neural networks cp ann methods
7458,for the analysed tablets calibration models were built using unnormalised spectra and spectra normalised by the intensity of a selected band of an internal standard
7459,different pre processing methods were applied for the capsules
7460,to compare the predictive ability of the models the relative standard errors of prediction rsep were calculated
7461,the x cp ann and pls methods gave models of comparable quality which were usually more efficient than the pcr ones
7462,the rsep error values for the tablets were in the range of for the calibration and for the validation data sets and for the three procedures applied
7463,for capsules the rsep errors were in the range of and for the calibration and validation samples respectively
7464,five commercial products containing or mg of diclofenac sodium per tablet capsule were quantified
7465,concentrations found from the raman data analysis agree with the results of the reference analysis and correlate strongly with the declared values with the recovery of and for the pls pcr and cp ann methods respectively
7466,the proposed procedure can be a fast and convenient alternative to the standard pharmacopoeial methods of diclofenac sodium quantification in solid dosage forms
7467,the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of prolonged treatment with preservative free diclofenac sodium eye drops in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis vkc
7468,a prospective open study was performed in patients with vkc treated with preservative free diclofenac sodium eye drops
7469,patients used the eye drops four times daily in both eyes for days
7470,signs papillae hyperaemia and corneal lesions and symptoms itching redness and photophobia of the ocular surface were graded and statistically evaluated before and after treatment by a non parametric test mann whitney u test
7471,forty per cent of the patients showed an improvement in their symptoms at the end of the treatment
7472,total signs and symptoms scores were significantly decreased at the end of treatment compared with the baseline values from to and from to respectively p
7473,significant decreases in conjunctival redness p itching p and photophobia p were observed at the end of treatment
7474,conjunctival hyperaemia was significantly reduced p at the end of treatment while no significant differences were observed for corneal lesions and for papillary size
7475,no patient showed exacerbation of the disease during the treatment
7476,vkc is a chronic disease that requires prolonged treatment to control the inflammatory process
7477,our preliminary study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of preservative free diclofenac sodium eye drops in controlling the signs and symptoms of vkc in prolonged treatment
7478,the budgetary impact of prescribing a combined formulation of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol to patients previously using nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaids cytoprotective agents or a combination of agents from both therapeutic categories is assessed as is the clinical rationale for prescribing the combined formulation
7479,analysis of data for canada on claims paid by third parties showed that the use of the combined formulation in canada had resulted in significant initial overall savings and that the greatest cost savings were made for those who had previously used both an nsaid and a cytoprotective concomitantly
7480,the inclusion of shadow costs secondary costs indicates that the use of the combined formulation over a month period involves very low shadow costs medical expenses related to ulcer treatment compared with other nsaids the shadow cost multiplication factor was for the combined formulation compared with to for other nsaids
7481,pharmaceutical costs alone are insufficient for evaluating total budgetary impacts
7482,a biodegradable diclofenac sodium ds microsphere system using chitosan has been characterized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo
7483,the particle size distribution and drug content was determined
7484,the release rate data were investigated by using zero order first order hixson crowel and higuchi kinetics
7485,the optimum ds chitosan microsphere formulation empty chitosan microspheres sustained release commercial product and plain drug were evaluated for pharmacological activity
7486,the ulcerogenic index in rabbits was also determined
7487,the effect of diclofenac microm on rat uterus contraction and its modification by ouabain mm amiloride and mm ouabain mm plus amiloride mm and the replacement of sodium by choline have been assayed
7488,diclofenac produces dose dependent relaxation of vanadate mm induced contraction ec microm
7489,this effect is significantly reduced in choline medium ec microm and by ouabain in sodium medium ec microm
7490,amiloride displaces in a dose dependent way the diclofenac induced relaxant effect
7491,however ouabain plus amiloride did not produce a sinergic effect
7492,our results suggest that diclofenac produces relaxation of vanadate induced contraction by activation of na ca exchange
7493,previous studies have shown that aspirin interacts with orally administered diclofenac sodium causing reduced peak concentrations lower levels and decreased areas under curves
7494,in this study diclofenac sodium was administered orally and intravenously with and without aspirin to healthy female volunteers
7495,after intravenous dosing both plasma levels and areas under curves were significantly reduced although none of the rate constants was affected
7496,the volume of distribution of diclofenac was increased as was the plasma clearance
7497,oral administration with aspirin also resulted in lower plasma levels particularly peak levels and areas under curves
7498,comparison of auc s for both modes of administration with and without aspirin suggested that lower levels after oral administration were not due to impaired absorption
7499,these observations are best explained by decreased protein binding and increased biliary excretion of diclofenac in the presence of salicylate
7500,the bioavailability of an in vitro sustained release formulation of diclofenac sodium was compared with a conventional product in six healthy male volunteers
7501,the administration of a single dose mg of either formulation in a crossover design revealed significant differences in the extent of absorption as assessed by auc
7502,the relative bioavailability of the sustained release formulation was found to be compared with the conventional product
7503,the cmax for the sustained release formulation micrograms ml was significantly much lower than the corresponding value for the conventional formulation
7504,however the tmax for the sustained release formulation h was not significantly different from the corresponding value for the conventional formulation h
7505,although the sustained release formulation showed serum concentration time profiles characteristic of sustained products in vivo it failed to attain therapeutic drug levels
7506,the in vivo results were found inconsistent with the in vitro availability of the drug
7507,sustained release matrix pellets loaded with w w diclofenac sodium ds were prepared using extrusion spheronization technique
7508,different polyethylene glycols pegs of different molecular weight namely peg peg and peg were mixed with avicel ph in different weight ratios to manufacture the pellet formulations and water was used as a binder
7509,mix torque rheometer was used to characterize the pellets wet mass
7510,also the prepared pellets were characterized for their particle sizes ds content shape and morphology as well as the in vitro drug release
7511,the results showed increasing peg weight ratio resulted in a reduction of wet mass torque as well as binder ratio especially at peg high weight ratios and and the extent of lowering wet mass peak torque was inversely proportional to peg molecular weight
7512,the manufactured pellets exhibited size range of m to m with small span values
7513,the drug release from pellets was governed by the molecular weight of peg used since increasing peg molecular weight resulted in slowing the drug release rate from pellets but increasing its level resulted in enhancing release rate
7514,this was attributed to increasing pellet wet mass peak torque by increasing peg molecular weight and lowering it by increasing peg level
7515,the prepared pellets showed non fickian or anomalous drug release or the coupled diffusion polymer relaxation
7516,solution thermodynamics and solubilization behavior of diclofenac sodium ds in binary mixture of transcutol hp and water is not reported in the literature so far
7517,therefore the aim of the present study was to investigate the solution thermodynamics and solubilization behavior of ds in mono solvents and various transcutol water mixtures at k the mole fraction solubility of ds was determined by shake flask method and thermodynamic parameters enthalpies and entropies were calculated with the help of the modified apelblat model
7518,the experimental solubility data of ds in all sample matrices was found to be correlated well with the modified apelblat model with correlation coefficients of absolute relative deviation was found to be less than in most of the transcutol water mixtures at each temperature studied
7519,the mole fraction solubility of ds was observed to be highest in pure transcutol at k as compared to pure water and other transcutol water mixtures
7520,the enthalpies and entropies for ds dissolution were observed as positive values for all cosolvent mixtures which indicated that the dissolution of ds is endothermic and an entropy driven process
7521,based on solubility data ds was considered as sparingly soluble in pure water and freely soluble in transcutol
7522,these results indicated that transcutol could be used as an alternate of ethanol propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol to enhance aqueous solubility of ds
7523,these preliminary studies could be useful in formulation development of ds especially in terms of liquid dosage forms and injectable formulations
7524,glycerol monooleate gmo based mesophases offer extensive prospects for incorporation of various bioactive molecules
7525,this work deals with the solubilization of selected cell penetrating peptides cpps together with sodium diclofenac na dfc within the h ii mesophase for transdermal applications
7526,the effect of cpps such as rala an amphipatic cpp penetratin pen and oligoarginine nona on na dfc skin permeation kinetics to provide controlled release and tune the drug transdermal diffusion was studied
7527,the location of the drug and the cpps within the mesophase was probed by dsc and ftir
7528,na dfc was found to be located at the interfacial region between the surfactant chains leading to denser h ii mesophase
7529,the hydrophilic nona was intercalated into the aqueous cylinders and caused their swelling
7530,it induced a significant decrease in the hydrogen binding between the gmo carbonyls and their surrounding
7531,the amphiphilic pen was entrapped within two different regions depending on its concentration
7532,pen and nona improved na dfc permeation by whereas rala enhanced permeation by
7533,when estimating na dfc migration rate out of the mesophase toward surrounding aqueous media it appeared to be slower with the cpps
7534,the peptides were not involved at this diffusion controlled step
7535,it seems that their effect on skin permeation is based on their specific interaction with the skin
7536,the objective of the work was to assess the possible interactions between the model drug diclofenac sodium ds and the water insoluble ammonio methacrylate copolymer amc
7537,films with different drug polymer ratios were therefore prepared by the solvent casting method and investigated as a preformulation study towards sustained release microparticles
7538,differential scanning calorimetry dsc and thermogravimetric analysis tga were used to investigate the dispersed dissolved state of the ds in the preparation the thermal stability and the properties of ds containing amc films and raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the possible interactions between ds and amc
7539,thermoanalytical studies confirmed that the ds could behave as a plasticizer which was indicated by decreasing glass transition temperature tg of the amc depending on its dispersity level in the amc matrix
7540,partially solid solutions were formed at ds amc ratios of and the ds was mainly crystalline at ds amc ratio of while it remained crystalline at a ratio of the raman spectra confirmed that none of the major structural changes revealed any significant difference which can indicate a strong ionic interaction between the ds and the amc
7541,the investigations provided good facilities for the selection of a ds amc ratio in the preformulation study of the microsphere preparation process in conformity with the therapeutic aim
7542,the pain assocaited with ureteral obstruction is caused by a rise in intraluminal pressure above the obstruction which produces an increase in tension of the ureteral smooth muscle
7543,a reduction in pressure will result in decreased tension and relief of pain
7544,in this study we used papaverine and a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium to decrease ureteral tension and compaired their effects on isolated human ureteric smooth muscle
7545,experiment have been carried out with isolated ring preparation of human ureter
7546,the tissue displayed spontaneous activity and contracted when exposed to kcl mm
7547,papaverine m and diclofenac sodium m were applied on the precontracted segments and isometric variation was recorded with nihon kohden tb isometric transducer
7548,their relaxant responses were comparatively examined
7549,mean relaxation obtained by diclofenac sodium and papaverine were respectively and
7550,our study showed that diclofenac sodium may be more potent than papaverine in the treatment of renal colic
7551,chitosan ch was dissolved in aqueous solutions containing aspartic glutamic hydrochloric lactic and citric acids to obtain different chitosan salts
7552,chitosan salts were collected from the solutions by spray drying and the powders obtained were mixed with sodium diclofenac sd taken as a model anti inflammatory drug
7553,this study evaluated in vitro the influence of acid type on the release behaviour of sd from the physical mixture during gastrointestinal transit
7554,the physical mixture of the chitosan salts with sd provided slower drug release than the pure drug both in acidic and alkaline phs
7555,in addition the interaction with beta glucosidase at ph enhanced the release rate
7556,among the ch salts used glutamic and aspartic salts provided the best control of release
7557,tenoxicam and diclofenac sodium were compared with each other for analgesic efficacy following removal of third molars under general anesthesia
7558,thirty five healthy patients between the ages of and yr were randomly allocated to two groups to participate in this study
7559,patients in group a n received a single intravenous injection of tenoxicam mg at induction of anesthesia followed by a mg tablet given in the evening of the day of the operation and thereafter one mg tablet daily from days to group b n received a single intramuscular injection of diclofenac sodium mg at induction of anesthesia followed by a mg tablet to hr after the operation and again between hr and hr the same day
7560,thereafter a mg tablet was taken times daily for the next days
7561,pain was measured hourly for the first hr postoperatively then at hr and thereafter in the morning and the evenings on days to the highest pain scores were obtained hr postoperatively for both trial groups
7562,at and hr postoperatively no statistical significant differences in pain scores could be shown for both groups
7563,however at and hr postoperatively patients in the tenoxicam group experienced significantly p or less pain than those in the diclofenac sodium group
7564,on the evening of the third postoperative day the tenoxicam group of patients experienced significantly less pain p or than those in the diclofenac sodium group
7565,this was again the case on the morning of the fourth postoperative day
7566,on the fifth sixth and seventh postoperative days the average pain scores for patients in the tenoxicam group were statistically significantly lower both mornings and evenings than those in the diclofenac sodium group of patients p
7567,we investigated the effects of diclofenac sodium and indomethacin on the proliferation of and collagen synthesis by lens epithelial cells lecs of human cataracts in culture
7568,the anterior capsule with attached lecs obtained by anterior capsulotomy during cataract surgery was cultured directly without cell dispersion
7569,when the culture became almost confluent diclofenac sodium or indomethacin at various concentrations was added to the incubation medium
7570,the incorporation of h thymidine and h proline into the lecs was measured after the cells were labeled with these radioactive materials
7571,both drugs greatly suppressed the incorporation of h thymidine and of h proline indicating that they inhibit cell division and collagen synthesis by lecs
7572,both drugs may help prevent posterior capsule opacification
7573,the x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf on solid samples is applied to the organic bromine impurities assay on pharmaceutical formulations of sodium diclofenac dcf
7574,a wide range of br contents ppm in the tablets is obtained depending on manufacturer source and batch preparation
7575,as the impurities concern only the sodium diclofenac employed and the presence of br might be a toxicity index arising from the synthetic procedure the assay of each dcf batch is suggested
7576,in order to investigate the effects of the non steroidal antiinflammatory drug diclofenac sodium on thyroid function male and female volunteers were given single dose of mg diclofenac sodium
7577,ninety minutes after the administration of the drug the concentrations of total t total t and free t were decreased significantly but the concentrations of free t and the levels of t uptake free t and free t were increased
7578,when diclofenac sodium was added to serum in vitro the levels of free t free t and t uptake were increased
7579,these results showed that diclofenac sodium inhibited the binding of t and t competitively to the binding protein
7580,the apparent decline in the concentrations of total t and total t after diclofenac sodium administration suggested that the drug altered distribution and metabolism of t and t mainly by increasing their free forms
7581,ninety two nonglaucomatous patients undergoing extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens by residents at a veterans hospital were randomized in double masked fashion to receive either a topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent diclofenac sodium or a placebo consisting of vehicle only
7582,one drop of placebo or diclofenac sodium was administered on an inpatient basis by trained staff every hours for three doses starting the afternoon prior to surgery
7583,a further drop was given at and minutes before the operation
7584,starting hours after surgery all patients received diclofenac sodium
7585,all patients remained hospitalized for hours postoperatively
7586,mean baseline intraocular pressure iop was and mm hg in the diclofenac and placebo groups respectively
7587,iop rose mm hg in both groups at hours after surgery
7588,at hours the mean iop elevation from baseline was mm hg in the diclofenac group and mm hg in the placebo group p
7589,within the first hours iop spiked more than mm hg in of the diclofenac patients and in of the placebo patients
7590,these results suggest that diclofenac sodium drops affect neither the incidence nor the height of iop elevation following cataract surgery
7591,pain is an inevitable outcome of any periodontal surgery
7592,controlling postoperative pain is of utmost importance so as to increase patient compliance
7593,the present study aims to compare the degree of postoperative analgesia with the use of oral diclofenac sodium and transdermal diclofenac patch following periodontal flap surgery in patients with chronic periodontitis
7594,a total of patients requiring full mouth flap surgery were selected for this study
7595,flap surgery was performed quadrant wise and transdermal diclofenac patch was applied on the right arm following surgery of one of the quadrants and mg oral diclofenac sodium twice daily was prescribed following surgery of the subsequent quadrant
7596,the postoperative pain was recorded on visual analog scale and pain intensity scale h after the surgery
7597,both the statistical and clinical observation showed that diclofenac sodium administered transdermally has equal efficacy as compared to drug administered orally
7598,the study concludes that the diclofenac administered transdermally has equal potency in relieving postoperative pain as compared to orally administered diclofenac sodium following modified flap surgery
7599,transdermal patch has an added advantage of better patient compliance as it does not cause gastric disturbance
7600,treatment with indomethacin and diclofenac sodium was found to increase granulocyte counts in the blood of sublethally gamma irradiated mice
7601,treatment with sodium salicylate was ineffective in this respect administration of sodium salicylate together with indomethacin even decreased the indomethacin induced effects
7602,the results suggest that the hemopoiesis stimulating effects of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs cannot be correlated with the anti inflammatory activity but rather with the side effects of these compounds including the action on gastro intestinal prostanoid production
7603,this conclusion doubts on the possibility of the usefulness of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs in conditions of the radiation syndrome
7604,diclofenac sodium ds a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug has a bitter taste and is a local stomach irritant
7605,the aim of this study was to formulate taste masked ds orally dispersible tablets odts with targeted drug release in the intestine
7606,pellets of ds were designed using sugar sphere cores layered with ds followed by an enteric coat of eudragit l and a second coat of eudragit e for taste masking
7607,the produced pellets had a high loading efficiency of with diameters ranging from to m
7608,the prepared pellets were spherical with smooth surfaces on scanning electron microscopy examination
7609,pellets with the enteric coat eudragit l followed by eudragit e resulted in ds release in simulated gastric fluid sgf and complete dissolution in simulated intestinal fluid sif
7610,the pellets were then used to formulate odts
7611,diclofenac sodium ds was the third generation non steroidal drugs with analgesic and antipyretic properties
7612,owing to taking action faster long lasting potency good efficacy and low side effects ds was widely used in the pharmaceutical industry
7613,to further ensure animal food safety and consumer health the rational usages regulations of ds and ds withdrawal time should be provided
7614,in the present study a new high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms method was first established for extracting and validating diclofenac sodium levels in edible porcine tissues
7615,meanwhile the pharmacokinetics characteristics and residue elimination of intramuscular ds administration in pigs were also studied
7616,we found ds eliminated quickly and the distribution was poor in vivo
7617,after a single dose of mg kg body weight per day for continuous days the withdrawal time in the tissues of liver kidney sebum muscle and administration site were days days days days and days respectively
7618,according to the double sided confidence interval ds withdrawal period should be days
7619,these experiment evidences lay a good foundation on the rational usages regulations of ds and ds withdrawal time which will be helpful for the animal food safety and consumer health
7620,in the present work we have attempted to deliver diclofenac sodium to a target site by intra arterial injection of gelatin magnetic microspheres and subsequent localization using an external magnet
7621,drug loaded magnetic microspheres were prepared by emulsification cross linking method characterized by drug loading magnetite content size distribution optical microscopy scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared ft ir analysis differential scanning calorimetry dsc x ray diffraction xrd absence of glutaraldehyde by gas chromatography and in vitro release studies
7622,the targeting efficiency and the therapeutic efficacy of microspheres were studied in vivo in rabbits
7623,the microspheres showed drug loading of w w magnetite content of w w with an average size range of mum depending upon the drug polymer ratio
7624,they were spherical in nature as evidenced by optical microscopy and sem
7625,ft ir dsc and xrd studies revealed the absence of drug polymer interaction
7626,gas chromatography confirmed the absence of residual glutaraldehyde
7627,the microspheres were able to prolong the drug release over days and the application of sonication during in vitro release study has slightly increased the release rate
7628,after intra arterial administration of microspheres of injected dose was recovered at the target site which revealed good targeting efficiency
7629,the microspheres effectively reduced joint swelling but lesser extent than the oral diclofenac sodium in high dose in antigen induced arthritic rabbits without producing gastric ulceration which was observed in rabbits treated with oral diclofenac sodium
7630,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory widely used drug both in the treatment of the rheumatic diseases and as analgesic
7631,the fact that is a potent analgesic spread its use to almost all fields in medicine increasing the reports of adverse effects associated with it
7632,the main complications reported are gastrointestinal dermatological and of the central nervous system
7633,the authors present seven cases that developed tissue necrosis as a result of the intramuscular injection of diclofenac sodium
7634,because of the low incidence or this adverse effect a review is carried out and the physiopathologic mechanisms likely to be involved are discussed
7635,our aim is to warn against the indiscriminate intramuscular use of this drug
7636,forty nine patients with ureteral colic were included in this prospective double blind study investigating the analgesic efficacy and side effects of a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren versus a spasmolytic drug tropenzilium bromide palerol
7637,the analgesic efficacy and side effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine nidilat applied sublingually in ureteral colic were also investigated
7638,it was concluded that diclofenac sodium was more efficient for relieving pain due to acute ureteral obstruction and had fewer side effects than spasmolytic drugs
7639,nifedipine proved to have an analgesic effect equivalent to that of tropenzilium bromide
7640,the preparation of lipophilic matrix tablets for the sustained release of water soluble drugs via direct compression is not always feasible due to poor flow and rapid drug release
7641,the aim was to evaluate the potential for developing sustained release diclofenac sodium tablets using compritol ato as a lipid matrix by a wet granulation technique
7642,the effects of wet granulation method planetary mixer and fluid bed and liquid binder type hpmc metolose or on weight uniformity tensile strength and release rates were investigated
7643,the influence of compression force and speed during tablet manufacture under simulated rotary press production conditions were also evaluated
7644,rapid release of diclofenac sodium from directly compressed matrices was observed
7645,a wet granulation technique using different hpmc binders produced free flowing granules and matrices which released diclofenac sodium in a sustained manner over several hours
7646,when the formulation comprising the lowest viscosity grade hpmc metolose was further evaluated using a laboratory scale fluid bed system consistently sized granules with good flowability and matrices with good weight uniformity and tensile strengths were produced
7647,release rates were consistent over a range of compression speeds and forces indicating the suitability of the formulation for production on a rotary tablet press
7648,contrast enhanced ultrasonography ceus is a novel approach used for measuring organ perfusion changes
7649,studies using ceus to assess the effects of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids on renal blood flow rbf have not yet been conducted
7650,we aimed to evaluate the effects of nsaids on the renal hemodynamics of healthy subjects with ceus
7651,we performed ceus using the bolus injection method in a total of healthy subjects
7652,measurements were completed over two study days in a randomized crossover manner
7653,on each study day ceus was performed twice before and after the administration of nsaids
7654,subjects received an injection of contrast medium and images were recorded
7655,a region of interest roi was selected within the renal cortex signal intensity in the roi of the kidney was measured and a time intensity curve tic was automatically generated with attached software
7656,the mean sd peak intensity decreased significantly after an administration of diclofenac sodium from au to au p but not significantly with etodolac from au to au p
7657,the mean sd percent reduction in intensity following diclofenac sodium administration was significantly reduced compared with etodolac administration vs p
7658,these finding suggests that diclofenac sodium p but not etodolac p affects renal hemodynamics even in healthy subjects
7659,oral administration has been the most usual and convenient employed route of drug delivery systems
7660,particularly oral sustained release systems for the delivery of drugs by a process of continuous swelling of the polymeric carrier have been investigated
7661,thus the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc and carboxypolymer carbopol on the release behavior of diclofenac sodium ds from a swellable matrix tablet system
7662,nine different ds controlled released tablets were compressed by using the wet granulation technology
7663,the influence of the polymer content the polymer ratio the polymeric swelling behavior and the ph changes on the release rate of ds was investigated
7664,there was no significant difference in drug release when total polymer concentration was
7665,when the tablets were formulated having or of hpmc carbomer it was observed that a more rapid release of ds occurred as the carboxypolymer ratio within the matrices increased
7666,in agreement with previous results the dissolution studies demonstrated that the combination of these two polymeric matrix formers resulted in near zero order release rate of ds
7667,the ds release from all these matrix tablets was ph dependent being markedly reduced at lower ph and could be attributed to the poor solubility of ds at this ph value
7668,in hcl n solution hpmc controlled drug release because the carbomer has a low solubility at this ph
7669,as the ph increased the carbomer became ionized being able to interact with hpmc to control the drug release
7670,to find a reasonable method for treating and preventing fibrinous membrane after intraocular lens iol implantation by using diclofenac sodium or dionine topically
7671,forty eight eyes of twenty four adult pure bred new zealand rabbits were divided into three groups randomly
7672,group a rabits received diclofenac sodium eyedrops group b rabbits received dionine eyedrops group c controlled
7673,all the eyes received lens extraction combined with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
7674,the fibrinous membrane was observed after and days postoperatively
7675,the fibrinous membran in group a was less than that of group b and group c p the difference between group b and group c on fibrinous membrance was also statistically significant p
7676,the study suggests that both diclofenac sodium and the dionine eyedrops can treat fibrinous membrane after iol implantation
7677,the effect of diclofenac sodium is better than that of dionine
7678,hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose hpmc cps an aqueous soluble polymer was employed for coating diclofenac sodium dfs tablets mg for protecting the integrity of the drug yet rendering the drug to release at a faster rate on contact with the gastric environment
7679,proper optimization for the aqueous based film coating formulation was undertaken primarily employing plasticizers like polyethylene glycol peg and propylene glycol pg
7680,the defect free selected formulations were further subjected for studying the effects of surfactants like sodium lauryl sulphate sls and tween along with the plasticizers
7681,the quality of the aqueous film coats or the plasticizer efficiency in case of peg is in the order and for pg which can be stated on the basis of less incidence of major coat defects like chipping cracking orange peel roughness blistering blooming picking
7682,the quality of aqueous film coat or the surfactant efficiency in case of sls peg is in the order and sls pg is in the order
7683,in case of tween peg the order is and tween pg is in the order
7684,elegant film formation can be stated from fewer incidences of coat defects
7685,the obtained coated tablets eventually satisfied all the normal physical parameters like thickness weights and weight gain drug content crushing strength percent friability disintegration time dissolution profile and possible drug polymer interactions
7686,anova was undertaken followed by dunnet multiple comparison for the dissolution profile considering uncoated as the standard
7687,the difference was considered significant at p
7688,the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate mucoadhesive microsphere of diclofenac sodium with natural gums for sustained delivery
7689,guar gum and tragacanth were used along with sodium alginate as mucoadhesive polymers
7690,microspheres were formulated using orifice ionic gelation method
7691,particle size surface morphology swelling study and drug entrapment efficiency of the prepared microspheres were determined
7692,in vitro evaluation was carried out comprising of mucoadhesion and drug release study
7693,the prepared microspheres were discrete and free flowing
7694,sodium alginate and natural gum at a ratio of showed good mucoadhesive property and they had high drug entrapment efficiencies
7695,they also exhibited the best rate retarding effect among all the formulations
7696,drug entrapment efficiency of all the microspheres ranged from to
7697,an inverse relationship was found between extent of crosslinking and drug release rate
7698,release rate was slow and extended in case of the formulations of ratio f and f releasing and drug respectively after hours
7699,tragacanth containing microspheres of f showed superiority over other formulations with best mucoadhesive and rate retarding profile
7700,the correlation value r indicated that the drug release of all the formulations followed higuchi s model
7701,overall the results indicated that mucoadhesive microspheres containing natural gum can be promising in terms of prolonged delivery with good mucoadhesive action targeting the absorption site to thrive oral drug delivery
7702,the aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of diclofenac sodium to paracetamol using a visual analog scale in the patients presenting to the emergency room with primary dysmenorrhea
7703,group i n patients were diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea and treated with paracetamol gr intravenous and group ii n patients were diagnosed with primary dysmenorrhea and treated with diclofenac sodium mg intramuscular
7704,in both groups patients were years old
7705,in all groups the intensity of the pain was ranked from no pain to intolerable using vas
7706,the vas scores were compared between treatment groups
7707,between two groups there was no statistically significant difference in age mean arterial pressure and pulse values
7708,the initial vas values of the first group were higher than that of nd group
7709,following treatment in the th and th minutes the vas values were lower in group i than group ii p
7710,the vas values of each group were significantly different from each other on the th and th minutes
7711,vas values at the th and th minutes were lower compared to the initial values and the values in the th minute were lower relative to the th minute p in both treatment groups
7712,we can suggest that paracetamol is more efficient than diclofenac sodium in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea
7713,the aim of this study was to compare the anti edema effects of a stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost with parenteral and local forms of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium on traumatic soft tissue edema
7714,thirty two adult male rats were randomly divided into equal groups
7715,traumatic edema in one paw of each rat was produced by established protocol
7716,different drugs were then administered to each group intraperitoneal i p
7717,saline group control group topical diclofenac gel group i p
7718,diclofenac sodium group and i p
7719,iloprost group
7720,the volume of the paws was measured at baseline before trauma and at hour hours hours hours hours hours and hours after trauma
7721,the anti edema effects of these drugs diclofenac gel diclofenac sodium i p iloprost i p
7722,were compared to each other and to the control group
7723,the greatest increase in paw edema in the first second and fourth hours was seen in the control and iloprost groups
7724,at the hour measurement edema levels were all equal except control group
7725,following and hour measurements edema began to decrease in all groups
7726,after and hours the fastest decrease in edema was in iloprost group with complete resolution of edema by hours
7727,the next fastest decrease in paw volume was seen with i p
7728,diclofenac sodium followed by diclofenac gel
7729,iloprost has experimentally higher anti edema effect than diclofenac sodium for the conservative treatment of the traumatic soft tissue edema
7730,this study develops a novel transdermal delivery vehicle for the enhanced delivery of sodium diclofenac na dfc
7731,the system utilizes the advantages of reversed hexagonal lyotropic liquid crystals h ii lc combined with a peptide cell penetration enhancer cpe creating together an adaptable system that provides versatile options in the field of transdermal delivery
7732,this enhancer peptide is based on a family of amphipatic peptides that exhibit improved membrane permeability
7733,franz permeation cell experiments revealed that the peptide enhancer rala improved na dfc skin penetration of the liquid crystal fold
7734,we studied the structural effects of rala solubilization on the h ii mesophase
7735,rala acts as a chaotropic agent interfering in the structure of the water and causes a measurable swelling of the aqueous cylinders by a
7736,small angle x ray scattering saxs and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir measurements reveal enhanced hydration of the glycerol monooleate gmo headgroups and a increase in the fraction of non freezable water resulting from rala incorporation
7737,rala caused a gradual increase in the gmo effective headgroup area due to the hydration leading eventually to a transform of the hexagonal structure towards a lamellar one
7738,circular dichroism and atr ftir measurements showed a conservation of the peptide structure when incorporated into the h ii mesophase
7739,the combined h ii lc cpe systems can serve as high potential vehicles for a variety of drugs as they can easily be modified by varying the composition and temperature according to the required dose and delivery features
7740,diclofenac sodium ds may affect the number of purkinje cells in the developing cerebellum since ds can easily be transported from the maternal to the fetal physiological system during the pregnancy
7741,in the present study the effects of prenatal exposure to ds on the number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of week old w old and week old w old female rats were investigated
7742,there were two main groups the drug treated group dtg and the control group cg
7743,beginning from the th day after mating for a period of days a daily dose of mg kg of ds voltaren mg ml ampul novartis mefar ila sanayi a s kartal istanbul turkey was intraperitoneally injected in the dtg of pregnant rats
7744,in contrast a daily dose of ml kg of isotonic saline was intraperitoneally administered to the cg of pregnant rats during the same period
7745,after spontaneous delivery female offspring were obtained and the main groups offspring were divided into two subgroups as a w old group and a w old group
7746,therefore there were four groups at the end of the experiment the w old dtg and the cg and the w old dtg and the cg
7747,at the end of w and w offspring were perfused their brains were dissected and the number of cells estimated via the optical fractionator technique
7748,our results showed that while the total number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of offspring of dt w old female rats was significantly higher than that of the cg there was no significant difference between the w old dtg and the control groups
7749,therefore it could be suggested that ds administration during the prenatal period increases the number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of a developing female rat throughout postnatal w
7750,the need for controlled release formulations for diclofenac sodium ciprofloxacin and theophylline is well recognized
7751,in our study controlled release tablets of the three drugs were formulated by the matrix embedding technique using ethyl cellulose as retardant
7752,tablets of all the drugs were of good physical quality with respect to appearance drug content uniformity hardness weight variation and friability
7753,in vitro release rate studies showed that ethyl cellulose extended the release of the three drugs to hr or more
7754,release patterns from formulations of the three drugs followed higuchi s square root kinetics
7755,at ph the release rate was higher in all three drugs probably due to increased solubility of the drugs and or increased swelling of ethyl cellulose at the higher ph
7756,the formulations were highly stable and possessed reproducible release kinetics across batches
7757,the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of highly selective vagotomy hsv or misoprostol a prostaglandin e pge analog for protecting the gastroduodenal mucosa gdm from the effects of diclofenac sodium ds
7758,fifty mongrel dogs were randomly allocated to five groups
7759,hsv alone was performed in group i dogs controls to standardize the operation
7760,ds was given intramuscularly for consecutive days to the group ii dogs whereas in the group iii dogs hsv was performed followed a month later by ds administration as in group ii
7761,ds was given in combination with misoprostol for days to the group iv dogs
7762,hsv was performed on the group v dogs and a month later ds and misoprostol were given as in group iv
7763,after sacrificing the animals the gdm was examined for macroscopic and histologic lesions
7764,statistical analysis was made by fisher s exact test
7765,hsv alone did not protect the gastric or duodenal mucosa from the effects of ds p and p respectively
7766,misoprostol alone also did not offer significant protection to the gastric or the duodenal mucosa p and p respectively
7767,the combination of hsv plus misoprostol protected the gastric mucosa group v p but not the duodenal mucosa group v p
7768,hence hsv or misoprostol alone offers no protection to the gdm from the effects of ds
7769,the combination of hsv and misoprostol offers significant protection only to gastric mucosa
7770,enhancement of the mucosal defense mechanisms combined with strong reduction of gastric acidity may offer adequate protection to gastric mucosa from the effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
7771,diclofenac sodium voltaren was tested over a period of six months in a double blind experiment for its antiphlogistic and analgesic effect
7772,a retained or impacted lower third molar was removed from each of the patients studied
7773,the postoperative course was evaluated in terms of the criteria of pain trismus swelling and side effects and the results were recorded
7774,the swelling was objectified by photographic documentation and planimetric measurements
7775,our studies indicated that diclofenac sodium can also be recommended for the medicamentous prophylaxis of swelling and pain resulting from dental procedures
7776,a report is given on a long term controlled trial in which diclofenac sodium voltaren was compared with indomethacin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis both drugs being administered in a dosage of mg daily
7777,in this trial planned as a double blind study each patient was to participate for six months after which the patients treated with diclofenac sodium were to be followed up for a further six months
7778,by the end of the first six months diclofenac sodium had proved to be clearly superior to indomethacin in terms of therapeutic efficacy
7779,moreover unwanted effects referable to either the central nervous system or the gastro intestinal tract were less common and less severe in the patient treated with diclofenac sodium than in those receiving indomethacin
7780,these results demonstrate that when given as long term treatment to patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis voltaren is both effective and well tolerated
7781,the semi interpenetrating networks semi ipns of acrylamide grafted sodium alginate aam g naalg microspheres mps were prepared by emulsion crosslinking method using glutaraldehyde ga as a crosslinking agent
7782,the grafting of acrylamide onto sodium alginate was prepared by free radical graft polymerization using ceric ammonium nitrate can as initiator at three acrylamide concentrations with monomer to polymer ratio of and respectively
7783,the grafting efficiency was found to be
7784,the produced mps are almost spherical in nature with smooth surfaces
7785,diclofenac sodium ds an anti inflammatory drug was successfully encapsulated into the mps
7786,the encapsulation efficiency was found to vary between and
7787,the mps were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry dsc scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy
7788,the diffusion coefficient d was dependent upon the amount of crosslinking agent ga and amount of grafting ratio in the matrix
7789,the rate of release was found to be dependent on the amount of ga aam naalg grafting ratio and drug loading in the mps
7790,the release data have been fitted to an empirical equation to investigate the diffusional exponent n which indicated that the release mechanism from mps follows the super case ii transport
7791,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are widely used for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis but have the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular toxicity
7792,glucocorticoid was as effective as oral nsaids in the initial treatment of gout arthritis of patients intolerant of nsaids
7793,however whether glucocorticoid has the same or preferable effect as oral nsaids on patients with acute gouty arthritis irrespective of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks factor remains unknown
7794,this study was to compare the efficacy safety and tolerance of compound betamethasone diprospan mg intramuscular injection i m
7795,once for all during the study with diclofenac sodium mg twice a day in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis
7796,sixty patients with acute gouty arthritis were randomised to receive compound betamethasone mg i m
7797,once for all during the study or diclofenac sodium mg twice a day for days in this open label study
7798,pain intensity tenderness swelling and global assessment of response to therapy were collected as end points for the treatment
7799,the mean change in pain intensity from baseline to day and day in both treatment groups demonstrated that compound betamethasone had preferable efficacy over diclofenac sodium on day and comparable efficacy on day the compound betamethasone group had fewer adverse effects aes than diclofenac sodium group
7800,no statistically significant differences were observed about serum uric acid levels at different pain intensity at baseline
7801,a single dose of compound betamethasone may be better than diclofenac sodium for the treatment of acute gouty arthritis
7802,diclofenac sodium ds is commonly used as a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug
7803,although several adverse effects are clearly established it is still unknown whether prenatal exposure to ds has an effect on the development of the cerebellum
7804,in this study we investigated the total number of purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a control group and in a ds treated group of male rats using a stereological method
7805,the ds in a dose of mg kg daily was intraperitoneally injected to the drug treated group of pregnant rats beginning from the th day after mating for a period of days during pregnancy
7806,physiological serum at ml dose was intraperitoneally injected to the control group of pregnant rats at the same period
7807,after delivery male offspring were obtained and each main group was divided into two subgroups that were week old w old and week old w old
7808,our results showed that the total number of purkinje cells in offspring of drug treated rats was significantly lower than in the offspring of control animals
7809,these results suggest that the purkinje cells of a developing cerebellum may be affected by administration of ds during the prenatal period
7810,previous studies indicate that plasma levels of serotonin ht and intramuscular prostaglandin e pge participate in determining the mechanical pain threshold and tolerance level to pressure applied on the skin over healthy muscles
7811,other studies reported gender differences regarding responses to noxious stimuli
7812,the present study aimed to determine whether the mechanical pain threshold of healthy muscles is influenced by oral administration of ht or pge inhibitors and if there are any gender differences in this respect
7813,ten healthy female subjects and age matched healthy male subjects participated in the study which was randomized and double blind with crossover design
7814,granisetron ht antagonist diclofenac sodium pge antagonist and placebo were administered for days
7815,the pressure pain threshold ppt was recorded bilaterally with an algometer over certain orofacial trunk and limb muscles before and after administration of the antagonists
7816,the ppt over all muscles combined increased after administration of granisetron
7817,there was no change after administration of placebo
7818,the difference between granisetron and placebo was significant for the trapezius and tibialis anterior muscles
7819,diclofenac sodium did not influence the ppt and there was no difference compared to placebo
7820,although the basal ppt values were lower in females the ppt response to granisetron differed significantly between genders only in the tibialis anterior muscle
7821,in conclusion the results of this study showed that oral administration of the ht antagonist granisetron increased the ppt over healthy trunk and limb muscles but not over orofacial muscles and that the response in the limb muscles was greater in males
7822,a known impurity is formed in the production of a parenteral dosage form of diclofenac sodium if terminally sterilized by autoclave
7823,this impurity has been detected as dichlorophenyl indolin qone which is also an intermediate from which diclofenac sodium is generally synthesized
7824,it is only the condition of the autoclave method i e degrees c that enforces the intramolecular cyclic reaction of diclofenac sodium forming the indolinone derivative and sodium hydroxide
7825,the formation of this impurity has been found to depend on the initial ph of the formulation
7826,the reaction follows first order kinetics and the energy of activation is kcal mol
7827,the other excipients in the formulation do not have a role in this reaction
7828,the concentration of the impurity in the resultant product in the ampule goes beyond the limit of the raw materials in the pharmacopoeias
7829,it is thus preferable to use an alternative sterilization method that is an aseptic filtration method in which the formation of this impurity can be avoided
7830,the antipyretic activity of diclofenac sodium mg suppository was studied retrospectively in applications in seven intensive care patients
7831,diclofenac sodium proved to be a very potent antipyretic agent with serious side effects
7832,acute oliguria and protracted circulatory shock occurred after administration necessitating the administration of increasing amounts of dopamine and i v
7834,possible mechanisms involved are discussed
7835,diclofenac sodium is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug that has been studied in the united states for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients of whom were enrolled in five multicenter double blind parallel controlled investigations
7836,results of these trials indicate that mg daily of diclofenac is more effective than placebo and as effective as g daily of ibuprofen or g daily of aspirin
7837,moreover the safety profile of diclofenac proved to be better than that of aspirin and similar to that of ibuprofen
7838,to study the possible effects of diclofenac sodium on intestinal anastomoses rabbits were submitted to surgery consisting of two single layer ileal anastomoses performed with separate propylene sutures
7839,the animals were divided at random into two groups test and control
7840,the animals in the test group were given intramuscular injections of diclofenac sodium at the dose of mg kg body weight at hour intervals and the control animals were given injections of an identical amount of percent saline
7841,the animals were sacrificed on the rd th and th postoperative days for macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and of the anastomoses tensile strength measurement hydroxyproline determination and histopathologic examination
7842,the following results were observed anastomotic dehiscence followed by peritonitis and death in five test animals percent and no control animals decreased anastomotic tensile strength on the th day in test animals p less than delayed acute inflammatory response and onset of fibroblast proliferation in the test group and similar hydroxyproline levels in both groups
7843,on the basis of the results obtained we conclude that diclofenac sodium had a negative effect on intestinal anastomotic healing
7844,in this study acrylamide aam was grafted onto poly vinyl alcohol pva with uv radiation at ambient temperature
7845,the graft copolymer pva g paam was characterized by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir elemental analysis and differential scanning calorimetry dsc
7846,polymeric blend beads of pva g paam and pva with sodium alginate naalg were prepared by cross linking with glutaraldehyde ga and used to deliver a model anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium ds
7847,preparation condition of the beads was optimized by considering the percentage entrapment efficiency particle size swelling capacity of beads and their release data
7848,effects of variables such as pva naalg ratio acrylamide content exposure time to ga and drug polymer ratio on the release of ds were discussed at three different ph values
7849,it was observed that ds release from the beads decreased with increasing pva naalg m m ratio drug polymer ratio d p and extent of cross linking
7850,however ds release increased with increasing acrylamide content of the pva g paam polymer
7851,the highest ds release was obtained to be for pva g paam naalg ratio beads
7852,it was also observed from release results that ds release from the beads through the external medium is much higher at high ph and than that at low ph
7853,the drug release from the beads mostly followed case ii transport
7854,layered double hydroxides ldhs are promising materials for the preparation of novel drug delivery matrices
7855,to reveal the interaction between ldhs and polymers a series of ph sensitive sodium alginate layered double hydroxides sa ldhs hybrid beads were prepared using the simple surface crosslinking method
7856,the sa ldhs hybrid beads were characterized by ftir xrd and sem to study their structure and the role that ldhs play
7857,swelling behaviors in various aqueous solutions and drug loading as well as controlled release behavior of the sa ldhs hybrid beads were also investigated by using diclofenac sodium ds as the model drug to reveal the effects of introduced ldhs
7858,the results indicate that the positively charged ldhs layers are adsorbed on the negatively charged sa polymer chains through electrostatic interaction and act as inorganic crosslinkers in the three dimensional network
7859,in addition a small part of ds molecules intercalate into layers of ldhs through an anion exchange process
7860,the electrostatic interaction between ldhs and sa has restricted movability of the sa polymer chains and then slows down swelling and dissolution rates of the sa ldhs hybrid beads in aqueous solutions
7861,the electrostatic interaction and the intercalation of ds into layers of ldhs have also improved the entrapment efficiency ee and controlled release behavior of sa ldhs hybrid beads for ds
7862,synthetic mobil crystalline material mcm as a mesoporous material and functionalized mcm using aminopropyl groups were studied in order to investigate their ability to encapsulate and to control the release of diclofenac sodium and piroxicam
7863,mcm was synthesized through sol gel procedure and functionalized with aminopropyl groups
7864,the physicochemical properties of mcm were studied through particle size analysis infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy and carbon hydrogen nitrogen analysis
7865,diclofenac sodium and piroxicam were loaded into the mcm matrix using the filtration and solvent evaporation methods
7866,the drug loading capacity was determined by ultraviolet fourier transform infrared x ray diffraction and brunauer emmett teller analysis
7867,according to the results for pure drug release was released in the
7868,our findings indicate that after functionalization of mcm it could offer a good means of delivering controlled diclofenac sodium and piroxicam
7869,fluoroquinolones are broad spectrum antibiotics work against gram positive and gram negative bacteria and are a clinically proven option for many resistant infections
7870,among fluoroquinolones levofloxacin works best against acute sinusitis inflammation of the lower airways acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis community acquired pneumonia complicated urinary tract infection including pyelonephritis chronic bacterial prostatitis and skin and soft tissue infection
7871,levofloxacin is a frequently prescribed antibacterial agent with diclofenac sodium for pain management in infectious conditions
7872,the objective of the present work is to evaluate the level of interaction between levofloxacin and diclofenac sodium
7873,in this work market available brands of both drugs were also evaluated for quality the physiochemical parameters like weight variation thickness variation and mechanical strength were determined
7874,similarly the percentage drug release and content uniformity test were also analyzed the tested quality attributes were found within the recommended pharmacopeia ranges except brand l that had high drug content while brand l and l were not found similar in ph when subjected to model dependent analysis levofloxacin showed compliance with first order higuchi hixson crowell and weibull at ph and
7875,however diclofenac sodium showed adherence with first order hixson crowell and weibull at ph and but following higuchi at ph and only
7876,the interaction studies were also performed spectrophotometrically and simultaneous equation was used to estimate the percentage availability of both the drugs at ph fassgf and fassif
7877,the studies showed that the percent availability of levofloxacin was increased significantly in fassif i e
7878,at minutes in the presence of diclofenac sodium
7879,gabapentin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids attenuate postoperative pain and neuropathic pain in humans
7880,the combination of gabapentin and nsaids is effective for postoperative pain and enhances functional recovery after surgery
7881,intrathecal administration of gabapentin or nsaids inhibits hyperalgesia in a rat postoperative pain model
7882,however there is no information on the effects of intrathecal administration of a combination of gabapentin and nsaids
7883,we therefore investigated the effects of intrathecal administration of gabapentin and nsaids in a rat model of postoperative pain
7884,rats were prepared for intrathecal catheters under halothane anesthesia
7885,two days after catheterization gabapentin or g per l of saline diclofenac sodium a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor or g per l of glucose l saline l glucose and a combination of gabapentin and diclofenac g gabapentin g diclofenac and g gabapentin g diclofenac per l glucose were injected intrathecally
7886,we performed a hindpaw incision minutes after injection
7887,each group consisted of rats
7888,the mechanical threshold was measured to evaluate secondary hyperalgesia using von frey filaments before intrathecal catheterization and at hours and and days after paw incision
7889,gabapentin g attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia for days compared with the control group
7890,diclofenac g inhibited hyperalgesia for days compared with the control group
7891,the g gabapentin g diclofenac group had a significantly reduced secondary hyperalgesic response in hours and day compared with g gabapentin and g diclofenac respectively
7892,the g gabapentin g diclofenac group had a significantly reduced secondary hyperalgesic response in hours and day compared with g diclofenac
7893,the withdrawal threshold on the contralateral paw did not change compared with the preincision threshold
7894,intrathecal administration of gabapentin and diclofenac in combination reduced secondary hyperalgesia at doses having no antihyperalgesic effects when given individually
7895,our results suggest that gabapentin and diclofenac have an important role in postoperative pain reduction at the spinal level and that gabapentin augments the antihyperalgesic effects of diclofenac through action in the spinal cord
7896,dissolution characteristics of four extended release er generic formulations of diclofenac sodium were examined
7897,the aim of this study was to compare the drug dissolution behavior of diclofenac er generics to clarify whether the products are characterized by comparable dissolution characteristics under the applied test conditions
7898,the investigations were performed in the usp apparatus and in the new biorelevant dissolution stress test device
7899,the experiments yielded striking differences between the generic formulations
7900,applying usp apparatus it was noticed that the dissolution profiles of the products were distinctly affected by the stirring rate
7901,using the biorelevant dissolution stress test device susceptibility of the products to biorelevant stresses was observed
7902,change of ph within the experiments reduced the dissolution rates of all formulations and distinctly influenced their dissolution characteristics
7903,the study demonstrates clearly the divergences in the dissolution behavior among the generic er formulations of diclofenac sodium
7904,the observed susceptibility of the tested dosage forms toward biorelevant stress bears in our interpretation the risk to cause unwanted fluctuations in drug plasma concentration profiles
7905,nanoparticles were designed for the oral administration and transmucosal colon delivery of drugs
7906,preparation parameters were studied in order to develop solid ph dependent drug release nanoparticles constituted by hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin and or eudragit l loaded with diclofenac sodium
7907,nanoemulsions were prepared by the emulsion evaporation method using various homogenizers
7908,different preparative conditions were tested
7909,the emulsions obtained were analysed in terms of size and then dried to obtain solid nanoparticles which were characterized in vitro particle size morphology dissolution solid state characterization
7910,the effect of nanoparticles on drug permeation through synthetic membranes colonic pig mucosa and caco cell line were performed
7911,toxicity studies were carried out to assess the safety of the raw materials used and the nanosystems produced
7912,appropriate parameters to obtain nanoemulsions stable enough to be desiccated were determined panda nsl was the most suitable homogenizer for the preparation particle size ranged between and nm depending on the production method
7913,solid nanoparticles were obtained by an exsiccation process which does not modify the mean size
7914,ph dependent drug release nanoparticles were obtained
7915,the nanoencapsulation process decreased the crystallinity of the drug
7916,materials and nanoparticles were highly biocompatible
7917,transmucosal delivery of drug is dependent on the polymer and the test employed cyclodextrin improved drug permeation across colonic pig mucosa
7918,formulations containing hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin represent new colon targeted nanoparticles for transmucosal delivery of drugs
7919,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug widely used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis
7920,in this context a rapid onset of action is required
7921,thus the aim of this study was to formulate diclofenac sodium pvp k fast release tablets from solid dispersions
7922,the physical state and drug carrier interactions were analyzed by x ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy and stability upon storage was also studied
7923,dissolution rate of diclofenac sodium from solid dispersions was markedly enhanced by increasing the polymer concentration
7924,antimicrobial agents in combination with anti inflammatory drugs have been usually prescribed in both medicine and dentistry
7925,however few scientific reports support this clinical practice
7926,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of betamethasone and diclofenac sodium on serum and tissue concentration of amoxicillin in rats
7927,four polyurethane sponges were implanted in the back skin of rats
7928,after seven days the animals were divided into groups n
7929,group amoxicillin mg kg g diclofenac sodium mg kg g betamethasone mg kg g diclofenac sodium and amoxicillin g betamethasone and amoxicillin and g sodium chloride solution ml control group
7930,all drugs were administered in a single dose
7931,after minutes the granulomatous tissues of each animal were surgically removed and weighed
7932,blood was collected from cervical plexus centrifuged and microl of serum was placed on paper discs
7933,in order to estimate amoxicillin concentration serum and granulomatous tissues were separately submitted to microbiological assay which used cfu ml of staphylococcus aureus atcc penicillin susceptible strain
7934,after incubation hours degrees c the inhibition zones were measured and compared to a regression curve
7935,no inhibition zones were observed for groups and tissue and serum concentrations of both g microg g and microg ml respectively and g microg g and microg ml respectively showed statistically significant differences kruskal wallis p in comparison to g microg g and microg ml respectively
7936,g and g did not differ significantly p
7937,considering single doses betamethasone did not interfere with amoxicillin levels but diclofenac sodium reduced both tissue and serum levels of amoxicillin in rats
7938,coated pellets controlling drug release are a very popular dosage form which is widely used in medical practice
7939,at present the coatings of water insoluble polymers formed from aqueous dispersions are preferred
7940,however film formation from an aqueous polymeric dispersion is different from that from their organic solutions
7941,a stable film on the pellets surface is produced by coalesces of discrete latex particles at an optimum temperature
7942,the present experimental paper studied the changes of diclofenac sodium dissolution profiles from coated pellets when their coatings from an aqueous polymeric dispersion of ethyl cellulose were cured for different time periods hours and a temperature of degrees c drug release rate was decreasing with the increasing time of the layer curing up to hours
7943,at this time the dissolution curve was similar to a strait line
7944,when the curing time further increased the drug release was again faster
7945,all prepared samples with or without seal coat cured for a period of hour or uncured were filled into hard gelatine capsules and stored in blisters in three different stability boxes degrees c rh degrees c rh degrees c rh for or months
7946,the best drug dissolution profile and stability were observed for the pellets with the seal coat and ethyl cellulose coating cured for hours
7947,new types of diclofenac sodium suppositories known to control a drug release function for hospital preparations were developed based on a concept of the drug delivery system
7948,hard fat witepsol used as a base of the suppository consists of a mixture of triglycerides diglycerides and monoglycerides and each witepsol is characterized by its physicochemical properties
7949,authors disclosed that the amount of drug release measured in the commercially available diclofenac sodium suppositories decreased at a low temperature degrees c
7950,mixed types of diclofenac sodium suppositories consisting of witepsol w and witepsol e as a base were also prepared and their drug release functions investigated in vitro and in vivo
7951,the in vitro drug release properties changed with the mixing ratios of the two bases and with the temperature of the fluid tested
7952,the amount of released diclofenac sodium increased with increases of both the ratio of witepsol w in the suppository and the temperature of the test fluid
7953,moreover several processes causing these phenomena were evidenced by the image analysis
7954,the in vivo absorption of diclofenac sodium was found to be also influenced by these factors
7955,consequently it is predicted that such factors as the ratio of witepsol w in the suppository and the temperature will influence the drug absorption and the pharmacological effect of diclofenac sodium suppositories
7956,a double blind cross over trial compared the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects as well as tolerability of diclofenac sodium voltaren and ibuprofen
7957,twenty four outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis were included
7958,a single blind placebo period was inserted between the two active treatments
7959,the daily dose of diclofenac sodium was mg bid and that of ibuprofen mg tid
7960,the duration of each treatment period was days
7961,the efficacy was measured by the following criteria articular index lansbury morning stiffness fatigue pain measured on a visual analogue scale consumption of rescue analgesics status of the arthritic condition and patient preference
7962,no significant differences were found between diclofenac sodium and ibuprofen but regarding consumption of analgesic global evaluation rheumatic activity and activity index a slight trend towards a better effect of diclofenac sodium was found
7963,the study had an adequate sensitivity as it could distinguish placebo from the active treatments for all parameters evaluated
7964,no patient was withdrawn for unwanted effects
7965,none of the laboratory data showed abnormalities of clinical relevance
7966,to evaluate the cerebral and hemodynamic effects of low dose intramuscular diclofenac sodium dcfs administered for fever control in patients with acute brain injury in the intensive care unit
7967,inclusion criteria for this prospective clinical study were age years the ability to monitor intra arterial blood pressure core body temperature and intracranial pressure the placement of an indwelling jugular venous catheter for intermittent jugular venous oxygen saturation measurements and a core body temperature c
7968,exclusion criteria were hypovolemia administration of drugs with hemodynamic effects during the study period administration of antipyretics within hours before the start of the study acute heart failure cerebral vasospasm pregnancy renal and gastric diseases and allergy to dcfs
7969,the study enrolled patients with acute brain injury
7970,two we observed statistically significant decreases in core body temperature p systolic blood pressure p diastolic blood pressure p mean arterial pressure p heart rate p and cerebral perfusion pressure p hours after dcfs administration with respect to baseline t
7971,the dosage of noradrenaline norepinephrine in subjects receiving treatment at the start of the study increased significantly from g kg minute to g kg minute p
7972,low dose intramuscular dcfs administration for fever control in patients with acute brain injury is effective but also exposes patients to potentially deleterious hypotensive episodes that must be diagnosed and treated expeditiously to prevent further damage to the injured brain
7973,in our previous studies we have reported on the development of diclofenac sodium ds releasing rods
7974,however their drug release profiles were unsatisfactory
7975,to enhance the drug release properties of the implant we have developed a system whereby various elements can be combined into one implant
7976,melt extruded self reinforced sr and sterilized s ds containing sr plga billets were combined to produce multicomponent implants with various compositions
7977,these components were basically heat pressed together to form multicomponent rods
7978,drug release from single component and multicomponent rods was defined using a uv vis spectrophotometer
7979,ds was released from individual components within days and from multicomponent rods within days
7980,thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry dsc
7981,the melting temperature t m of multicomponent implants was about degrees c change in heat fusion deltah was j g and the glass transition temperature t g was degrees c mechanical strength was measured for weeks and it decreased from to mpa
7982,in conclusion by compression molding three components with different release rates it is possible to control the temporal release from multicomponent rods
7983,released ds concentrations were within range for days depending on the fractions of individual components used
7984,the use of polymeric carriers in formulations of therapeutic drug delivery systems has gained widespread application due to their advantage of being biodegradable and biocompatible
7985,among the microparticulate systems microspheres have a special importance since it is possible to target drugs and provide controlled release
7986,diclofenac sodium ds is a potent drug in the nsaid group having non steroidal anti inflammatory properties and is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis
7987,in this present study it was aimed to prepare microsphere formulations of ds using a natural biodegradable polymer as a carrier for intraarticular administration to extend the duration period of the dosage form in the knee joint
7988,microsphere formulations of ds which were prepared were evaluated in vitro for particle size yield value encapsulation efficiency surface morphology and in vitro drug release
7989,two appropriate formulations were selected for in vivo trials
7990,for the in vivo studies technetium m labelled polyclonal human immunogammaglobulin mtc hig was used as the radiopharmaceutical to demonstrate arthritic lesions by gamma scintigraphy
7991,after the induction of arthritis in knee joints of rabbits the radio labelled microspheres loaded with ds were injected directly into the articular cavity and at specific time points gamma scintigrams were obtained to find the residence time of the microspheres in knee joints in order to determine the most suitable formulation
7992,the ability of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids to induce ca mediated cyclosporin a sensitive mitochondrial membrane permeability transition mmpt was evaluated by monitoring swelling of isolated rat renal cortex mitochondria in the presence of microm cacl
7993,dipyrone and paracetamol did not induce mmpt while piroxicam and acetylsalicylic acid and its metabolite salicylate were poor inducers
7994,in contrast diclofenac sodium and mefenamic acid were potent triggering agents inducing mmpt at microm a concentration below those previously shown to uncouple and or inhibit oxidative phosphorylation
7995,when compared to salicylate a classical uncoupler and inducer of mmpt the potency of diclofenac sodium and mefenamic acid was about fold greater
7996,swelling was completely prevented by egta cyclosporin a or mgcl and only partially by adp or dithiothreitol
7997,under the same experimental conditions as for the swelling assays the drugs depressed the membrane potential of mitochondria an effect prevented by cyclosporin a and restored by egta
7998,also the drugs did not induce membrane lipid peroxidation or changes in gssg levels but led to a small decrease in protein thiol content as well as to a substantial decrease in the nadph levels of mitochondria
7999,hence membrane depolarization and pyridine nucleotide oxidation seem to be involved in mmpt induction by these nsaids
8000,the potency in eliciting the process like the uncoupling activity seems to be influenced by the lipophilic character of the molecules
8001,tenoxicam and diclofenac sodium were compared as analgesics following the surgical removal of third molars
8002,twenty five patients between the ages and years were randomly allocated into two groups
8003,patients in group a received a single intraoperative intravenous i v
8004,injection of mg of tenoxicam followed by a mg tablet given the evening after the operation thereafter one mg tablet was given once daily for the next days
8005,group b received a single intraoperative intramuscular injection of mg of diclofenac sodium followed by a mg tablet to hours postoperatively and during the evening thereafter a mg tablet was taken three times daily for the next days
8006,pain was postoperatively measured hourly for hours and later in the evening
8007,pain was also measured in the mornings and evenings for the next days
8008,the highest pain scores were obtained hour postoperatively for both groups
8009,during the first hours following administration patients in the tenoxicam group experienced significantly more pain than those in the diclofenac group
8010,preoperatively both treatments showed identical efficacy after hours
8011,it is therefore suggested that a mg dose of i v
8012,tenoxicam should be administered at induction of anesthesia to achieve a higher level of analgesia in the immediate postoperative phase
8013,inflammation is our body s normal defense mechanism but in some cases it may be responsible for causing different kinds of disorders
8014,several anti inflammatory drugs are present for the ailment of these disorders however the conventional anti inflammatory drugs give side effects when used in long term and therefore it is better to use them in a low dose for a shorter duration of time
8015,this study was designed to find out whether there is an augmentation of the therapeutic effectiveness of the anti inflammatory drugs like diclofenac sodium nsaid prednisolone steroid and atorvastatin statin when in combination with ascorbic acid antioxidant
8016,wistar rats n were selected and divided into groups of rats in each
8017,carrageenan and formalin were used to induce local inflammation and neuropsychiatric effects respectively
8018,the inhibitions of such responses were measured after administering a drug alone and in combination with ascorbic acid
8019,in case of carrageenan mediated inflammation the combination of mg kg diclofenac and mg kg ascorbic acid gave the highest inhibition of compared to other groups of drugs
8020,the combination of mg kg diclofenac and mg kg ascorbic acid gave inhibition for formalin mediated inflammation group
8021,in both cases combination therapy showed statistically significant anti inflammatory activities compared to mono therapy p values
8022,all the data clearly indicate new combinations of drug therapy comprising of diclofenac sodium prednisolone atorvastatin with ascorbic acid which may be more effective against both local edema and neuropsychiatric effect caused due to inflammation
8023,the aim of the present study was to investigate anti inflammatory activity of diclocor in the setting of collagen induced osteoarthritis in rats in comparison with its active monocomponents diclofenac sodium and quercetin
8024,the study was conducted on the model of collagen induced osteoarthritis and included measurement of sialic acids glycoproteins c reactive protein prostaglandin e keto prostaglandin f thromboxane b and leukotriene b
8025,lastly morphologic study with morphometry was also performed
8026,diclocor is superior to quercetin and diclofenac sodium by the degree of pharmacological effect on some of the studied parameters
8027,the differences between the values were statistically significant
8028,diclocor is a promising corrector of inflammatory and destructive joint diseases
8029,owing to the presence of both diclofenac sodium and quercetin in its composition diclocor exhibits a complex mechanism of anti inflammatory action affecting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase ways of arachidonic acid biotransformation
8030,the purpose of this study was to develop an electro responsive co polymeric erp implantable gel from polyethylene glycol peg sodium polystyrene sulphonate napss polyvinyl alcohol pva and diethyl acetomidomalonate daa for electro liberation of the model drug diclofenac sodium
8031,various physicochemical and physicomechanical characterization tests were undertaken on the synthesized drug free gel erp g and drug loaded gel erp g
8032,the ability of the gel to release diclofenac sodium following electrical stimulation was evaluated using a galvanostat while molecular mechanics mm simulations were performed to elucidate the experimental mechanisms
8033,a stable electro active gel exhibiting superior cycling stability was produced with desirable rheological properties rigidity bhn n n mm
8034,in this study we investigated the morphometric and histological alterations of the ovary and uterine horns in week old rats that were prenatally exposed to diclofenac sodium ds
8035,for this purpose pregnant rats were divided into two groups the control and drug treated groups
8036,beginning from the th day after mating through the th day of pregnancy ds mg kg daily was intraperitoneally injected in the treated group
8037,no injection was given to the rats in the control group
8038,after spontaneous delivery male offspring were obtained
8039,at the end of the th week ovary and uterine horn samples were removed
8040,following dissection and routine histological preparation histopathological and stereological investigations were carried out
8041,our results indicate that ds application leads to a decrease in the mean volume fraction of the uterine horn
8042,moreover there was an increased volume fraction in some structures of the ovary like the cortex medulla and zona granulosa
8043,there was no difference found between the two groups in terms of the mean volume of the antrum and the graafian follicle fraction
8044,finally in light of our findings we may suggest that ds may lead to adverse effects in rats that are prenatally subjected to this drug
8045,to compare the effectiveness of dexamethasone and diclofenac sodium eye drops in the resolution of inflammation following phacoemulsification surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens implants
8046,quasi experimental study
8047,ophthalmology department pns shifa hospital karachi from june to march
8048,one hundred subjects were operated and postoperatively divided into two groups designated as dexamethasone and diclofenac groups
8049,they were assessed for visual acuity and followed for weeks for the signs of inflammation which included cells and flare in the anterior chamber and striate keratopathy
8050,proportions were compared by fisher s exact test and the chi square test
8051,topically applied diclofenac sodium suppressed postoperative inflammation effectively but its anti inflammatory effects were of lesser magnitude as compared to that of topically applied dexamethasone drops p
8052,dexamethasone eye drops were found to have more potent anti inflammatory activity in moderate to severe cases than diclofenac sodium eye drops in postoperative cases
8053,the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids had been implicated as a risk factor for nonunion in spinal fusion
8054,even with a number of animal and human studies suggesting nsaids either delay or inhibit spinal fusion rates these drugs continue to be used because of demonstrated benefits
8055,diclofenac sodium is no exception
8056,it is very popular as a first line treatment for acute pain even perioperatively for spine fusion patients
8057,review of published literature reveals no studies done on the effect of diclofenac sodium on spine fusion rates
8058,to determine if diclofenac sodium is a risk factor for delayed union and nonunion in adult patients who underwent one to two level instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion plif using only local autogenous bone graft
8059,retrospective analytical
8060,two hundred and seventy three adult patients who underwent one to two level plif with minimum year follow up
8061,diclofenac sodium intake fusion status
8062,medical records and radiographs of adult patients who underwent one to two level plif in a single institution from to were reviewed
8063,all patients did not use any nsaid or steroid perioperatively except for diclofenac sodium postoperatively
8064,the amount of diclofenac sodium used was quantified for the first days post op
8065,these patients were followed up periodically for years
8066,demographic data levels fused and nsaid intake were correlated to union status
8067,nineteen out of the patients had no diclofenac sodium intake no dose group patients used less than or equal to mg moderate dose group and patients used more than mg of diclofenac sodium high dose group
8068,there were nonunions and delayed unions seen
8069,no significant difference was seen when fusion status was compared with age sex l s versus other levels and smoking history all comparisons p
8070,there was a significant difference between one and two level fusions in terms of union status p
8071,there were no nonunions and delayed unions seen in patients in the single level fusion group
8072,all nonunions and delayed unions were noted among the patients in the two level group
8073,there were no cases of delayed union and nonunion in the no dose group
8074,there were also no nonunions but delayed unions in the moderate dose group
8075,there were nonunions and delayed unions in the high dose group
8076,as diclofenac sodium intake increases the incidence of delayed union and nonunion were also seen to increase p
8077,time to union was correlated to the amount of diclofenac sodium intake using pearson s correlation coefficient r p
8078,when the patients were divided into one and two level fusion groups the amount of diclofenac sodium used still had a significant positive correlation to frequency of delayed union and nonunion and in time to union in each group all comparisons p
8079,diclofenac sodium showed a dose dependent inhibitory effect toward spine fusion especially when used during the immediate postoperative period
8080,no significant correlation was seen between age sex l s versus other levels fused and smoking history when compared with spine nonunion
8081,two level lumbar fusions also showed a significant negative correlation to spine fusion compared with single level fusions
8082,the purpose of the present study was to develop and characterize an oral controlled release drug delivery system for concomitant administration of diclofenac sodium ds and chondroitin sulfate cs
8083,a hydrophilic matrix based tablet using different concentrations of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc was developed using wet granulation technique to contain mg of ds and mg of cs
8084,formulations prepared were evaluated for the release of ds and cs over a period of hours in ph phosphate buffer using united states pharmacopeia usp type ii dissolution apparatus
8085,along with usual physical properties the dynamics of water uptake and erosion degree of tablet were also investigated
8086,the in vitro drug release study revealed that hpmc kcr at a concentration of of the dosage form weight was able to control the simultaneous release of both ds and cs for hours
8087,the release of ds matched with the marketed cr tablet of ds with similarity factor f above water uptake and erosion study of tablets indicated that swelling followed by erosion could be the mechanism of drug release
8088,the in vitro release data of cs and ds followed korsmeyer peppas and zero order kinetics respectively
8089,in conclusion the in vitro release profile and the mathematical models indicate that release of cs and ds can be effectively controlled from a single tablet using hpmc matrix system
8090,the aim of this work was to compare the dissolution behaviour of six diclofenac sodium prolonged release tablets of different brands obtained from the national market
8091,the formulations contain the same amount of drug substance but different types and or amount of excipients
8092,the influence of these differences in formulation on the release characteristics of the dosage forms was evaluated on the european pharmacopoeia apparatus paddle employing eight different dissolution media in the ph range friability and hardness were tested too according to the european pharmacopoeia
8093,dissolution profiles obtained from the studied formulations showed that the release characteristics vary considerably among different manufacturers and that even identical formulations show rather dissimilar release profiles in all the studied media
8094,use of both sif without pancreatin and sif without pancreatin containing w v tween resulted in strong discrimination among products
8095,a correlation between friability and hardness and in vitro dissolution was evidenced for two formulations having identical excipient composition
8096,the effects of diclofenac a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid on the fast tetrodotoxin sensitive ttx s and the slow tetrodotoxin resistant ttx r sodium currents in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were investigated using the whole cell patch clamp method
8097,diclofenac suppressed both sodium currents in a dose dependent manner
8098,the apparent dissociation constants for the diclofenac suppression of ttx s and ttx r sodium currents were estimated to be and microm respectively at a holding potential of mv
8099,diclofenac had no effect on the kinetic parameters of the activation process in either type of sodium current
8100,however diclofenac produced shifts of the steady state inactivation curves in the hyperpolarizing direction in both types of sodium currents in a dose dependent manner
8101,at sufficiently negative holding potentials the inhibitory effects of diclofenac on both types of sodium currents were minimal
8102,the results suggested that diclofenac might bind to sodium channels with a greater affinity when they are in the inactivated state than when they are in the resting state
8103,effects of other nsaids acetylsalicylic acid antipyrin indomethacin and flufenamic acid on sodium currents were tested
8104,among these only flufenamic acid suppressed the sodium currents to a considerable extent
8105,thus the chemical structure of each nsaid not the inhibition of cyclooxygenase seems to be an important determinant in the sodium current inhibition
8106,the suppression of sodium currents in sensory neurons by diclofenac and flufenamic acid would contribute to their analgesic activity in addition to their inhibition of cyclooxygenase
8107,a sensitive and selective microcalorimetric technique has been used to determine the enthalpy of solution of diclofenac sodium ds paracetamol pc and their binary mixtures over a wide range of composition in the ph range the systems showed endothermic behavior
8108,the molar enthalpies of solutions of ds vary between and kj mol at ph and for pc from to kj mol at ph the excess molar enthalpy of their mixtures has also been determined
8109,the values of excess molar enthalpy of solutions are negative and very low in magnitude indicating no specific interaction between ds and pc in solution
8110,the low affinity interaction between human serum albumin hsa and diclofenac sodium dcf was studied using nmr techniques
8111,both c nmr chemical shift and linewidth show that the dichlorophenyl ring in dcf molecule plays a primary role in its interaction with hsa
8112,langmuir adsorption isotherm was applied to evaluate the association constant k and the number of binding sites n of the drug hsa complex through h nmr spin lattice relaxation measurement
8113,the results indicate that langmuir isotherm can perfectly explain the capacity of low affinity binding of proteins for the ligands
8114,multiple w o w type emulsions were prepared and stabilized through interfacial complex films formation as a result of interaction of macromolecules like gelatin bovine serum albumin bsa polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyacrylic acid paa each present in internal aqueous phase separately with sorbitan monostearate span present in the middle oil phase
8115,the stability of prepared emulsions was assessed using microscopic analysis which showed no significant changes in the average size of globule and number of droplets counted per cubic mm on storage
8116,viscosity and zeta potential studies revealed appreciable stability of the multiple emulsions
8117,the multiple emulsion containing macromolecules in their internal phase demonstrated better entrapment efficiency
8118,intramuscular injection of drug in a w o w emulsion formulation provided a protracted drug plasma profile for diclofenac sodium
8119,we synthesized composite microspheres from cellulose nanocrystal cnc polyvinyl alcohol pva and sodium alginate sa which were modified with polyethyleneimine pei to introduce a high density of active amino sites onto the surface via the schiff base reaction
8120,we hypothesized that these sa cnc pva pei microspheres would have a high adsorption capacity for aqueous diclofenac sodium ds
8121,the pei modified composite microspheres were characterized and assessed and optimized for aqueous ds adsorption
8122,in addition the morphology and synthesis mechanism of the adsorbent were studied
8123,the adsorption process showed a good fit with the pseudo second order kinetic model i e the process is driven by a chemical adsorption mechanism and langmuir adsorption isotherm model i e adsorption follows a single layer process
8124,under the optimum experimental conditions ph adsorption time min temperature k the maximum adsorption capacity was mg g which was relatively high compared to other reported adsorbents
8125,importantly after five adsorption desorption cycles sa cnc pva pei showed only a slight loss in adsorption capacity
8126,compared with other reported adsorbents the core shell composite has a good ds adsorptive capacity and high recyclability
8127,a novel hplc uv method was developed for the simultaneous determination of timolol tm rosuvastatin rst and diclofenac sodium ds in pharmaceuticals human plasma and aqueous humor using naproxen sodium as internal standard is
8128,the target compounds were analyzed on hypersil bds c column mm mm m applying triethylamine tea and acetonitrile acn v v in isocratic mode as mobile phase ph adjusted with phosphoric acid at a flow rate of ml min
8129,the column oven temperature was kept at c and the peak response was monitored at nm after injecting a l sample into hplc system
8130,the direct liquid liquid extraction procedure was applied to human plasma and bovine aqueous humor samples using mobile phase as an extraction solvent after deproteination with methanol
8131,the different hplc experimental parameters were optimized and the method was validated according to standard guidelines
8132,the recoveries of the suggested method in human plasma were and for tm rst and ds while in aqueous humor were and for tm and ds respectively
8133,the lod values were found to be and ng ml for tm rst and ds respectively while their respective loq values were and ng ml
8134,the co efficient of variation cv were in the range of and for intra day and inter day studies respectively
8135,the method was found accurate in human plasma and bovine aqueous humor and will be applied for the quantification of these compounds in plasma and aqueous humor samples using animal models and in pharmaceuticals
8136,this article reports a significant reduction of gastric ulcerogenicity by complex formation of a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug with surfactants
8137,diclofenac sodium dfna was suspended in medium chain triglyceride mct by forming a complex with an edible lipophilic surfactant
8138,two types of suspensions prepared through a membrane emulsification with different pore sizes were evaluated according to the degree of gastric damage following multiple oral administration in rats
8139,it was shown that gastric ulcerogenicity of dfna was reduced by the surfactant drug complexes at doses up to mg kg whereas severe gastric damage was observed upon oral administration of the aqueous solution at doses of mg kg
8140,comparable blood levels of dfna were observed after administration of solution and suspension formulations
8141,the yield of pellets obtained in preparing diclofenac sodium dc na controlled release pellets was affected by the lactose starch ratio of the feed granules viscosity of the binding solution and residence time in the rolling pot
8142,the pellet shape was found to be correlated with surface tension of the binding solution
8143,the concentration and composition of the coating solution and pellet size distribution were responsible for the agglutination in coating
8144,the controlled release pellets crp and commercial tablets ct of dc na were administrated orally to healthy volunteers by multiple dose
8145,the steady state condition based on trough plasma concentration on day was achieved on day a great difference in plasma drug concentration fluctuation index fi between crp and ct was observed p during steady state
8146,the area under the plasma drug concentration time curve for a h interval auc on day of crp micrograms h ml and ct micrograms h ml was shown to be not significantly different p
8147,the relative bioavailability in the human was about
8148,the effect of a low dose of diclofenac sodium administered locally on heterotopic bone formation in rats was investigated
8149,heterotopic bone was induced by implantation of demineralised bone matrix into the gluteal muscles
8150,diclofenac was released continuously for weeks from micro osmotic pumps for each demineralised bone implant in the rats
8151,each had a control implant in the opposite gluteal muscle to which saline was released in the same way
8152,the yield of new woven bone was determined after weeks by measuring the ash weights of the implants
8153,those of the diclofenac samples were significantly decreased compared to the controls
8154,these results suggest that a low dose of diclofenac given locally decreases heterotopic bone formation in rats
8155,the residual pain of type i decompression sickness limb bends occurring despite recompression therapy is due to an acute inflammatory reaction in the soft tissue around the joint
8156,this case history reports an excellent response in resolving residual pain by the use of an intramuscular injection of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium
8157,the theoretical reasons for this are discussed
8158,to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic administration of the topical diclofenac on macular thickness in diabetic patients following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery
8159,in a randomized double masked clinical trial eyes of diabetic patients underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation surgery were enrolled
8160,fifty four eyes received the conventional postoperative care with steroid drop whereas the other group eyes was given a preoperative diclofenac drop four times daily in addition to steroid drop and continued weeks after surgery
8161,all patients were evaluated by optical coherence tomography oct preoperatively and days and the outcome measures including best corrected visual acuity and oct findings were compared in and between both groups
8162,mean cmt changed from and at baseline to and at months in the case and control groups respectively p
8163,mean total volume of macula changed from and at baseline to and at months in the case and control groups respectively p
8164,in comparison to the quadrants thicknesses and mean of them between groups did not reach the significant level
8165,this study showed that there is a beneficial effect of topical diclofenac for prevention of macular thickness increasing following phacoemulsification in diabetic patients
8166,a tubular bismuth film electrode bfe installed as part of a multisyringe flow injection system was used as an amperometric detector to determine the concentration of diclofenac sodium in pharmaceutical formulations
8167,a tubular voltammetric detection cell was employed in which the hydrodynamic flow conditions were not disturbed
8168,this automated method allows the continuous regeneration of the bfe preventing passivation of the detector and improving the sensitivity of detection
8169,the influence of several variables on this sensitivity such as the injection volume deposition time and flow rate were evaluated a two level factorial experimental design was employed for this
8170,in optimal conditions the linear range of the calibration curve varied from micromol l with a detection limit of micromol l
8171,a sampling rate of determinations h was achieved the relative standard deviation of analytical repeatability was
8172,after injections the bismuth film on the electrode surface was automatically renewed
8173,the method was validated by comparing the results obtained with those provided by rp hplc no significant difference were seen p
8174,the effects of two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs ibuprofen mg day kg and diclofenac sodium mg day kg on the severity of gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity were evaluated in rats
8175,administration of gentamicin mg day kg for days resulted in a significant increase in renal cortical total phospholipids accompanied by a significant decrease in cortical na k atpase activity
8176,these changes were associated with a significant decrease in body weight and increases in kidney weight serum creatinine and urea nitrogen
8177,in rats treated simultaneously with both gentamicin and either ibuprofen or diclofenac sodium for days all the measured parameters of renal dysfunction were similar in magnitude to those observed in rats treated with gentamicin alone
8178,in contrast rats treated with either ibuprofen or diclofenac sodium for days and injected concurrently with gentamicin during the last days of the treatment period had significantly higher kidney weight lower renal cortical na k atpase activity and higher cortical phospholipid content serum creatinine and urea nitrogen than did rats treated with gentamicin alone
8179,a day treatment with ibuprofen or diclofenac sodium alone resulted in no change in renal function
8180,these results demonstrate that gentamicin nephrotoxicity was potentiated after the long days but not after the short days period of treatment with ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium
8181,thus prolonged administration of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs should be considered as a risk factor that may increase the nephrotoxic potential of gentamicin
8182,a double blind comparative trial in patients using diclofenac voltarol and ibuprofen brufen showed a considerable improvement in morning stiffness amongst females in the diclofenac group
8183,however no significant differences was noted between these two drugs in relation to pain score articular index or proximal interphalangeal joint size
8184,analysis of withdrawals and side effects suggests that while ibuprofen may be slightly better tolerated it is also associated with significantly more withdrawals due to lack of effect
8185,no significant change in laboratory studies was noted except for a slight decrease in mean haemoglobin levels
8186,the trialist noted that all of the drop outs and side effects reported came from one hospital out of the four participating this was possibly due to differences in pre trial drug therapy and to the hospital being in an urban rather a rural situation
8187,research continues to develop novel therapeutic modalities that particularly focus on the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis
8188,this study aimed to assess the effects of diclofenac sodium and octreotide alone or in combination on pancreatic enzymes pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity histopathology and apoptosis of pancreas cells using a model of experimentally induced acute pancreatitis
8189,we aimed to demonstrate effects of diclofenac sodium octreotide and their combined use on pancreatic enzymes activity of pancreatic myeloperoxidase mpo activity histopathology and apoptosis of pancreas on treatment of caerulin induced experimental acute pancreatitis
8190,caerulin induced acute pancreatitis model was created using a total of male balb c mice of gr in seven groups
8191,serum amylase lipase levels and pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity were examined as well as apoptotic values in pancreatic acinar cells through tunnel method
8192,histopathology of pancreas was evaluated for presence of edema hemorrhage parenchymal necrosis fat necrosis leukocyte infiltration and fibrosis
8193,in the diclofenac sodium group apoptotic values in the pancreatic acinar cells were found to be statistically lower than in the acute pancreatitis group in terms of parenchymal necrosis and hemorrhage scores p p and p respectively
8194,no statistically significant differences were found in serum level of amylase lipase pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity and the other histopathological scores p
8195,diclofenac sodium a cost effective agent with a favorable side effect profile may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute pancreatitis
8196,findings of this study suggest a better efficacy for diclofenac sodium monotherapy as compared to octreotide alone or octreotide diclofenac combination
8197,novel carboxymethyl guar gum cmg chemically modified multiwalled carbon nanotube mcnt hybrid hydrogels were synthesized at different mcnt levels as potential device for sustained trans dermal release of diclofenac sodium
8198,spectroscopy together with morphology thermogravimetry and rheological studies proved relatively strong cmg mcnt interaction at and wt levels of mcnt whereas de wetting was increased with higher mcnt concentration
8199,drug encapsulation tendency increased with addition of mcnt maximum entrapment was noticed at wt mcnt level
8200,hydrogels containing and wt mcnt exhibited slower trans dermal release than neat cmg due to slightly higher gel viscosity and more drug entrapment
8201,slowest but steady release was obtained from wt mcnt loaded hydrogel due to highest viscous resistance among all other hybrid nanocomposites

8306,the cell cycle and apoptotic rate were observed by flow cytometer
8307,mtt assay showed that diclofenac sodium had obvious inhibitory effect on rcecs and the inhibition rate was increasing along with the increasing concentration of diclofenac sodium and the incubation time p
8308,flow cytometer showed that after incubation with diclofenac sodium the cells in g g phase were obviously increased and the apoptosis cusp and apoptotic rate were increased
8309,diclofenac sodium exerts significant inhibitory effect on rcecs in a dosage dependent manner and it may function by inducing cell apoptosis and ceasing cell cycles
8310,the effect of magnesium aluminium silicate mas on rheological release and permeation characteristics of diclofenac sodium ds aqueous gels was investigated
8311,ds aqueous gels were prepared using various gelling agents such as w w poloxamer pm w w hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc and w w high and low viscosity grades of sodium alginate hv sa and lv sa respectively
8312,different amounts of mas and w w were incorporated into the ds gels
8313,incorporation of mas into the ds gels prepared using sa or pm caused a statistical increase in viscosity p and a shift from newtonian flow to pseudoplastic flow with thixotropic property
8314,the ds release rates of these composite gels were significantly decreased p when compared with the control gels
8315,this was due to an interaction between mas and pm or sa and adsorption of ds onto mas particles
8316,moreover a longer lag time and no change in ds permeation flux were found when mas was added to the gels
8317,the findings suggest that the rheological characteristics of gels prepared using pm or sa could be improved by incorporating mas
8318,however the use of mas could retard the ds release and extend the lag time of ds permeation
8319,the influence of propylene glycol pg on the in vitro penetration of diclofenac sodium dfs through a synthetic membrane and abdominal rat skin from carbopol gels was investigated using franz type diffusion cells
8320,the combined effect of isopropyl myristate ipm and pg was also evaluated
8321,it was found that the penetration through the synthetic membrane was well described by the higuchi model
8322,the gel containing pg showed the highest release rate indicating that a releasing maximum exists for pg content which provides the fully solubilized drug in the vehicle
8323,when using rat skin as the barrier the penetration rate was controlled by the membrane
8324,dfs flux decreased with increasing pg content of the gels due to an increase of the drug affinity to the vehicle
8325,a cosolvent action of pg was evident
8326,however the combination of pg and ipm resulted in a synergistic enhancement of dfs flux
8327,maximum enhancing activity was obtained from gels containing pg which yielded an enhancement ratio of about increasing ipm content from to increased the flux and decreased the lag time taken to reach a steady state level

8334,cuff pressure was continuously monitored and maintained at mmhg
8335,the mean duration of anaesthesia was min in the diclofenac group and min in the saline group
8336,diclofenac inhibited prostaglandin synthesis as evident from serum thromboxane b and urinary keto prostaglandin f alpha data
8337,there was no difference in recovery as assessed from the orientation time min and min for diclofenac and saline patients respectively perceptual speed and ability to walk along a straight line and min after anaesthesia
8338,emetic symptoms were equally common in both groups an overall incidence of and for the diclofenac and saline patients respectively
8339,in the whole patient series women became nauseated and vomited more than men p less than
8340,diclofenac reduced the incidence of pain in the throat or oral region h after anaesthesia p less than and other symptoms h postoperatively p less than
8341,thus preoperative intravenous diclofenac appears useful in ambulatory patients undergoing restorative dentistry and oral surgery under isoflurane anaesthesia
8342,the ulcer inducing potential indicated by the oral dose that induced gastric ulcers in of rats was higher for tenoxicam mg kg than for diclofenac sodium mg kg equivalent to mg kg tenoxicam or piroxicam mg kg
8343,the mean lesion scores a measure of the intensity of ulceration using and mg kg tenoxicam given orally were and respectively compared with and respectively for similar oral doses of piroxicam the differences were statistically significant p less than and p less than respectively
8344,the mean lesion score for mg kg tenoxicam was also significantly p less than less than that for mg kg diclofenac sodium compared with ranitidine mg kg and mg kg sucralfate but not mg kg ranitidine strongly inhibited ulceration induced by mg kg tenoxicam

8377,the optimized formulations of paracetamol and diclofenac sodium were used for manufacturing of bi layer tablets
8378,the bi layer tablets showed immediate release of paracetamol and modified release of diclofenac
8379,in this study the effect of vehicle on in vitro diffusion of diclofenac sodium ds from new different formulations such as carbopol gel a sodium lauryl sulphate cream b and carbopol cream c was evaluated with franz diffusion cells using hydrophilic and hydrophobic synthetic membranes
8380,the commercial formulation voltaren emulgel was used as reference
8381,furthermore the in vivo efficacy of topical formulations was studied in the carrageenan induced edema and hyperalgesia whereas the antinociceptive effect was evaluated on thermal pain threshold in rat paw
8382,the flux of ds across hydrophilic membranes showed this rank order control approximately equal to c a approximately equal to b on the other hand the diffusion rate of ds across hydrophobic membranes resulted in the following order control b a approximately equal to c this suggested a lower interaction between the vehicles and these membranes
8383,the in vivo results indicated that the prepared formulations failed in the inflammatory tests to reduce the development of edema
8384,nevertheless treatment with b formulation inhibited the development of acute hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan and elicited a significant increase in paw withdrawal latencies whereas other formulations were ineffective
8385,the results obtained in this study suggest that sodium lauryl sulphate cream might be useful in local pain conditions and may be an effective alternative to the presently used systemic routes

8408,seven scheduled blood samples were collected from each patient for determining plasma concentrations of diclofenac anion
8409,both diclofenac sodium softgel and cataflam were significantly more effective than placebo p for all summary analgesic measures
8410,the average overall pain relief was substantially better from diclofenac sodium softgel than from cataflam but the difference was not statistically significant p
8411,in patients taking diclofenac sodium softgel of the patients experienced a time to onset of analgesic activity within minutes and the median analgesic duration was hours minutes
8412,fifty percent of the patients taking cataflam had a time to onset of action within minutes and the median duration of analgesia was hours minutes
8413,at the time of rescue drug administration or hours whichever was earlier of the patients given diclofenac sodium softgel rated the medication as a very good or excellent pain reliever whereas only of the patients taking cataflam gave these ratings

8433,the plasma concentration of kallikrein reaches control level again after two weeks
8434,its urine excretion was increased to control levels after the third week
8435,these changes in the kallikrein kinin system did not reach the level of significance
8436,it is concluded that diclofenac sodium has only a short term influence on the kallikrein kinin system
8437,following several years of development and validation we applied the womac osteoarthritis index as the principal outcome measure in a double blind randomized parallel trial of meclomen mg po tid and voltaren mg po tid
8438,statistically significant improvements in clinical status were noted in both treatment groups
8439,at the doses studied between drug differences favoring meclomen were observed in pain and stiffness no difference being noted in physical function
8440,no significant between drug difference was noted in tolerability at these same doses
8441,our study also demonstrated that the relative efficiency of womac was similar to that of the lequesne and doyle indices
8442,finally we defined the standard deviation necessary to calculate sample size for future studies using the womac index both for studies based on static scores and those based on change scores
8443,the objective of the present study was to develop a topical preparation with enhanced skin permeation high safety and self preserving ability
8444,microemulsion me and cationic polymer based micro emulgel cpbm were investigated for the transdermal delivery of diclofenac sodium ds
8445,medium chain triglyceride was selected as the oil phase of me due to its good solubilization of ds and high safety
8446,orthogonal test was applied to optimize the formula of me based on the cumulative skin permeation amount in vitro after preliminary formula test
8447,chitosan cs or polylysine was employed as the cationic polymer in the formula of cpbm
8448,the transdermal delivery of ds was evaluated through in vitro skin permeation test
8449,the results showed that the skin permeation rate of ds from the optimized cpbm g cm h were folds and folds higher than that of ds commercial emulgel and ds control hydrogel respectively
8450,mes and the cationic polymer were found to have skin penetration co enhancing effect when they were combined in the cpbm system
8451,furthermore the cpbm showed a good growth inhibition of e coli and s aureus
8452,the stability test revealed that the cpbm was stable at room temperature and c for a period of three months
8453,in this study xanthan gum facilitated ethyl cellulose microsponges were prepared by the double emulsification technique and subsequently dispersed in a carbopol gel base for controlled delivery of diclofenac sodium to the skin
8454,scanning electron microscopy revealed the porous spherical nature of the microsponges
8455,increase in the drug polymer ratio m m increased their yield drug entrapment efficiency and mean particle diameter m
8456,compared to the microsponges with high drug polymer ratio m m the flux of entrapped drug through excised rat skin decreased by and respectively for the microsponges prepared at low and intermediate drug polymer ratios
8457,when an equivalent amount of pure drug not entrapped into microsponges was dispersed into the gel base and the flux was compared the microsponges drug polymer ratio m m were found to reduce the flux by
8458,whether the drug was dispersed either in un entrapped or entrapped form into the gel base the drug permeation through rat skin followed higuchi s diffusion kinetic model
8459,the microsponges prepared at the lowest drug polymer ratio exhibited a comparatively slower drug permeation profile and were hence considered most suitable for controlled drug delivery application
8460,ftir spectroscopy and dsc analyses indicated the chemically stable amorphous nature of the drug in these microsponges
8461,the gel containing these optimized microsponges was comparable to that of a commercial gel formulation and did not show serious dermal reactions
8462,hence the microsponge system obtained at the lowest drug polymer ratio could be useful for controlled release of diclofenac sodium to the skin
8463,to evaluate the protective effect of woodfordia fruticosa kurz flowers against experimentally induced liver toxicity in rats
8464,two different doses of methanol extract of woodfordia fruticosa wfm were evaluated for the hepatoprotective activity against diclofenac sodium induced hepatotoxicity in rats
8465,various biochemical parameters like alanine aminotransferase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast alkaline phosphatase alp total protein tp albumin alb blood urea nitrogen bun from serum total protein tp glutathione gsh levels catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gpx activities from liver were studied histopathologic changes of liver were also evaluated
8466,wfm effectively reduced the elevated levels of serum alt ast alp and bun enhanced the reduced tp alb and hepatic gsh cat gpx activity
8467,the histopathological analysis suggested that wfm decreased the degree of liver fibrosis induced by diclofenac
8468,this study demonstrates the hepatoprotective activity of wfm and thus scientifically support the use of this plant in traditional medicine for the treatment of liver disorders
8469,to compare the efficacy and safety of nabumetone and diclofenac sodium in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra
8470,a hundred and twenty five patients with active ra were enrolled in a randomized open label controlled multicenter week study treating with nabumetone mg day or diclofenac sodium mg day
8471,clinical assessments were performed before beginning therapy and after and weeks of treatment
8472,endoscopy was performed respectively before and weeks after the medication in all patients
8473,the total efficacy rate of nabumetone was as high as that of diclofenac sodium vs chi p
8474,nabumetone treated patients showed significant improvement both in erythrocyte sedimentation rate mm h vs mm h f p in nabumetone group and mm h vs mm h f p in diclofenac sodium group respectively and c reactive protein mg dl vs mg dl f p in nabumetone group and mg dl vs mg dl f p in diclofenac sodium group respectively
8475,the variety and incidence of gastrointestinal gi symptoms attributed to nabumetone was comparable to that of diclofenac sodium
8476,the mean score of endoscopic lesions in the nabumetone group was significantly lower in the end of the treatment than those of their base line scoring p and there was no significant change with regard to the diclofenac sodium group
8477,the incidence of ulcer disease associated with nabumetone was and with diclofenac sodium
8478,nabumetone is as effective as diclofenac sodium in controlling the signs and symptoms of ra
8479,however gi lesions under the endoscope in the nabumetone group seemed to be less severe than that of the diclofenac sodium group
8480,to investigate the effect of diclofenac sodium and dexamethasone on cultured human tenon s capsule fibroblasts
8481,two experiments were conducted
8482,in the first experiment fibroblasts were treated with either diclofenac sodium or dexamethasone at different concentrations and the cell growth was quantified by using coulter counter and hexosaminidase methods at and days after adding the drugs
8483,in the second experiment the cells were treated with each drug for hours and then the cultures were switched to a drug free medium
8484,the cell growth was quantified at day after removing the drugs from the medium
8485,in the first experiment inhibition of fibroblast growth in a dose dependent manner was observed from days to in the cultures treated with each drug
8486,the inhibitory was more pronounced in the diclofenac treated cultures
8487,the typical spindle shaped fibroblasts treated with higher concentrations of the drugs became spherical cells
8488,in the second experiment inhibition was not observed when the cultures were switched to a drug free medium
8489,the spherical cells recovered to spindle shaped cells and proliferated as normal cells
8490,our results have shown that diclofenac sodium and dexamethasone can significantly inhibit human tenon s capsule fibroblast growth in a cell culture model
8491,the inhibitory effect was not observed when the cultures were switched after hours to a drug free culture medium
8492,to investigate the effect of diclofenac sodium salt and cyclosporin a csa on human lens epithelial cell hlec growth in culture
8493,cultures of hlec were obtained from anterior capsules from extracapsular cataract surgery
8494,third passage cells were seeded in well plates in ml culture medium
8495,cytotoxicity was estimated by the tetrazolium test in confluent monolayers after h exposure to a wide range of concentrations of diclofenac and csa
8496,the effect of subcytotoxic concentrations of diclofenac and csa on hlec proliferation in subconfluent cultures was evaluated after and h of exposure
8497,to investigate the relationship between pge synthesis and the inhibitory effect of these drugs after h of exposure to diclofenac and csa the production of pge was measured by radioimmunoassay
8498,we also tested the effect of exogenous pge addition to diclofenac h treated cultures
8499,diclofenac and csa at concentrations or microm and or microm respectively inhibited the proliferation of subconfluent cultures of hlec in a dose dependent fashion
8500,diclofenac inhibits pge synthesis while csa at high doses stimulates pge synthesis of cultured hlec
8501,exogenous pge addition reversed in part the inhibitory effect of diclofenac
8502,diclofenac and csa at appropriate doses are effective in inhibiting cultured hlec proliferation
8503,this could be of interest to prevent posterior capsule opacification
8504,further in vivo experimental studies seem worthwhile
8505,in this study carboxymethyl sulfate derivative clbs of locust bean gum lbg was synthesized by varying the strength of sulfating reagent
8506,clbs was characterized by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy elemental analysis and viscosity measurements
8507,furthermore the degree of sulfation and carboxymethylation in clbs was determined
8508,novel micro hydro gel particles of clbs were fabricated in basic aluminum chloride solution and different concentration of diclofenac sodium was incorporated into these particles
8509,differential scanning calorimetry and ftir analyses did not suggest any drug polymer interaction
8510,spherical morphological structures of the particles were evident under scanning electron microscope
8511,regardless of the formulation variables a maximum of drug entrapment efficiency was achieved
8512,for a higher degree of substitution clbs particles disintegrated rapidly min and released drug in acidic medium ph and ph in min
8513,however the particles liberated only drug in phosphate buffer medium ph during this period
8514,following disintegration of the particles the ph of gastric environment elevated
8515,in stomach histopathology the ulcers were scored and it was estimated that clbs afforded protection to the gastric mucosa from ulceration
8516,thus the micro hydro gel particles of clbs aluminium complex could be useful for immediate analgesic effect of the drug without any significant gastric distress
8517,the present study was designed to evaluate the nephroprotective effect of the leaves of
8518,thirty six healthy albino rabbits were randomly divided into six groups each with six animals
8519,group served as the untreated control group was treated only with diclofenac sodium group with the nephroprotective drug silymarin and groups and were treated with different doses of
8520,results of haematological studies showed that use of the powder of
8521,these results have shown that
8522,in this study the intensity and duration of analgesic effect of diclofenac na eudragit rs solid dispersion and nanoparticles were evaluated by using formalin test in the rats
8523,the animals received different formulations of diclofenac na and subsequently l of formalin solution was injected subcutaneously in the right paws after h h and h the paw licking behavior was then evaluated in two phases
8524,a dose of mg kg of pure diclofenac na powder was determined as effective dose
8525,in the first phase in term of reduced paw licking time no significant differences were found in any of the groups compared to the control group
8526,however in the second phase the animals which received pure drug powder and the physical mixture of diclofenac na with eudragit rs showed significant differences at the first and second hours
8527,in the animals received the nanoparticles and solid dispersion significant differences were observed in the third hour compared to the control group
8528,the analgesic effect of diclofenac na could be improved by formulating its nanoparticles and solid dispersion with eudragit rs
8529,however the nanoparticles revealed significantly higher analgesic effect than solid dispersion
8530,a kinetic method for the determination of micro quantities of diclofenac sodium ds is described in this paper
8531,the method is based on a ligand exchange reaction
8532,the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of appearance of the cobalt diclofenac complex at nm
8533,the optimum operating conditions regarding reagent concentrations and temperature were established
8534,the optimized conditions yielded a theoretical detection limit of microg ml based on the s b criterion
8535,the interference effects of certain drugs foreign ions and amino acids upon the reaction rate were studied in order to assess the selectivity of the method
8536,the developed procedure was successfully applied to the rapid determination of diclofenac sodium in commercial pharmaceutical preparations and human control serum
8537,the unique features of this procedure are that determination can be carried out at room temperature and the analysis time is short
8538,the newly developed method is simple inexpensive and efficient for use in the analysis of a large number of samples
8539,aim of this randomized prospective clinical trial is to compare two methods of antipyretics and evaluate their efficacy in controlling fever during the acute phase of brain damage
8540,twenty two febrile comatose patients severe traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage divided in groups diclofenac low dose infusion patients and extemporaneous boluses of nsaids ctrl patients
8541,the primary outcome measure was length of time with temperature degrees c secondary outcome measures were to assess the effects of each antipyretic strategy on intracranial pressure icp cerebral perfusion pressure cpp mean arterial pressure map and heart rate to monitor adverse effects of each antipyretic strategy
8542,the baseline characteristics in the two treatment groups were similar
8543,primary findings percentage of time per patient with temperature degrees c was significantly lower p in the dcf group vs in ctrl group
8544,in addition mean t degrees max t degrees were lower in dcf than in ctrl p
8545,secondary findings cpp and map were significantly higher in dcf group p while icp was not different ns
8546,however if icp pre randomization was mmhg ctrl suffered a worst icp vs p map vs p and cpp vs p compared to dcf
8547,no differences between the two treatment were recorded when icp or mmhg before randomization
8548,there was no gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding
8549,low dose dcf infusion is a potential useful strategy for a successful control temperature better than intermittent nsaids dosing minimizing potentially brain damaging effects of fever
8550,the objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo transdermal iontophoresis of various diclofenac sodium polymer formulations
8551,the excised rat skin human skin as well as cellulose membrane were used to examine the in vitro drug permeation whereas the microdialysis technique was used to monitor the drug concentration in vivo
8552,polymer solutions based on polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hpmc binary system showed higher drug permeability than that of single polymer vehicle
8553,the effect of formulations on drug permeation through cellulose membrane was quite different from those through rat skin and human skin which can be explained by the different permeation pathways between them
8554,it appeared to be a membrane controlled mechanism but not the vehicle matrix controlled mechanism for diclofenac hydrogels when using skin as the diffusion barrier
8555,the recovery of diclofenac sodium in the in vivo microdialysis was approximately indicating this technique can be used in the intradermal drug monitoring
8556,for all the polymer formulations tested there was a good relationship between the in vitro and in vivo drug permeation
8557,a synergistic effect on drug permeation was observed when transdermal iontophoresis combined with the pretreatment of cardamom oil as a permeation enhancer
8558,in a randomized double blind parallel group comparison the antiphlogistic and analgetic efficacy of high dosed vitamin e x mg rrr alpha tocopherolacetat d versus diclofenac sodium has been investigated in hospitalized patients with established chronic rheumatoid arthritis
8559,after weeks of treatment the vitamin e group n as well as the diclofenac group n showed a significant improvement of all assessed clinical parameters
8560,duration of morning stiffness could be reduced under vitamin e treatment from min to min and under diclofenac treatment from min to min
8561,the joint index according to richie declined from to vitamin e and to diclofenac
8562,grip strength increased in the vitamin e group as well as in the diclofenac group
8563,in addition the degree of pain assessed by a cm visual analogue scale reduced significantly under vitamin e as well as under diclofenac
8564,regarding the therapeutical result both physicians and patients considered both drugs to be similarly effective
8565,especially regarding the risk profile of nsar in long term treatment of chronic rheumatoid arthritis intake of high dosed vitamin e is a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatoid diseases
8566,a multicentre double blind randomized study was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis oa of the hip or knee in order to compare the efficacy and safety of the new cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor meloxicam with diclofenac sodium a conventional treatment for this condition
8567,three hundred and thirty six patients were treated with oral meloxicam mg once daily or diclofenac mg slow release once daily for months
8568,there were no significant differences between the treatment groups with respect to overall pain pain on movement global efficacy or quality of life scores at the end of treatment all of which showed good levels of improvement
8569,sixty six patients were withdrawn after the start of the double blind phase due to adverse events n meloxicam n diclofenac or to lack of efficacy seven in each group
8570,the median of dose paracetamol taken concomitantly was statistically significantly lower in the meloxicam group than in the diclofenac group vs mg day p with a comparable proportion of patients taking concomitant paracetamol therapy in both groups
8571,both drugs were well tolerated although severe adverse events treatment withdrawal and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were more common with diclofenac than with meloxicam
8572,thus meloxicam mg is a safe and effective treatment for oa of the hip and knee which demonstrates a trend towards an improved safety profile compared with diclofenac
8573,in the present study we examined the utility sensitivity and specificity of the cadmium and heat induced hemolysis investigating the effects of diclofenac salicylate and lidocaine carticaine and procaine on the rabbit erythrocyte membrane
8574,in the cadmium induced hemolysis which has not been reported as far as we know as a test model for local anesthetics the studied local anesthetics have to a large extent protective effects on the erythrocyte membranes probably based on an osmotic action at drug concentrations of to m on the other hand these local anesthetics amplify the heat induced hemolysis to a variable extent
8575,the studied antirheumatic drugs showed in the cadmium induced hemolysis that they cannot have the same binding sites as the local anesthetics investigated
8576,in the cadmium induced hemolysis the reaction products of the antirheumatic drugs with the membrane protein presumably cannot cause an increase in surface area volume ratio of the erythrocytes which is generally regarded as a cause for stabilization
8577,this interpretation could be an explanation for the increase of the cadmium induced hemolysis by the antirheumatic drugs studied
8578,on the other hand the antirheumatic drugs inhibited to a variable extent the heat induced hemolysis
8579,objective to determine the plasma pharmacokinetics and safety of diclofenac sodium cream applied topically to neonatal foals every hours for days
8580,animals twelve to day old healthy arabian and arabian pony cross neonatal foals
8581,procedures a cm strip of cream containing mg of diclofenac sodium n foals or an equivalent amount of placebo cream foals was applied topically to a cm square of shaved skin over the anterolateral aspect of the left tarsometatarsal region every hours for days
8582,physical examination cbc serum biochemistry urinalysis gastric endoscopy and ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys and right dorsal colon were performed before and after cream application
8583,venous blood samples were collected at predefined intervals following application of the diclofenac cream and plasma diclofenac concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
8584,results no foal developed any adverse effects attributed to diclofenac application and no significant differences in values of evaluated variables were identified between treatment groups
8585,plasma diclofenac concentrations peaked rapidly following application of the diclofenac cream reaching a maximum of ng ml within hours and declined rapidly after application ceased
8586,conclusions and clinical relevance topical application of the diclofenac sodium cream to foals as described appeared safe and low plasma concentrations of diclofenac suggested minimal systemic absorption
8587,practitioners may consider use of this medication to treat focal areas of pain and inflammation in neonatal foals
8588,various analgesic applications can be used during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy swl for pain relief and maximal success rate
8589,intracutaneous sterile water injection iswi has been shown to be effective in several types of pain but a gap exists about its use during swl
8590,in this paper we aimed to evaluate the effect of iswi during swl and compare that with diclofenac sodium injection used commonly to provide ideal patient contentment
8591,patients with kidney stone were randomized to have either iswi therapy or intramuscular non steroid anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium injection
8592,using a syringe ml of sterile water was administered to the triangle area bounded by the th costal margin the iliac crest and the vertebral spine in prone position
8593,visual analog scale vas was employed to record pain scores of patients
8594,other parameters including stone size swl duration total shock waves given used energy and the necessity of rescue analgesia were also noted
8595,a total of patients were recruited of those patients were treated with iswi and patients had diclofenac sodium injections
8596,the characteristics of the patients and shockwave therapy did not differ significantly between the two groups
8597,although the mean vas scores prior to swl and at every voltage increment during the procedure did not differ more patients in the diclofenac sodium injection group required rescue analgesia with significantly greater side effects
8598,iswi is found to be as effective as the diclofenac sodium injection for pain management during swl with lower adverse event rates
8599,there is a need to find discover novel leads to treat complex and or multi factorial disease s
8600,curcumin cur is one of the promising lead molecules which need its further evaluation against nsaid induced gastroenteropathy
8601,hence the aim of the present study was to explore the pharmaco mechanistic efficacy of cur against nsaid induced gastroenteropathy
8602,rats were treated twice daily with cur and mg kg
8603,this study was conducted to investigate the effect of gamma irradiation on physicochemical properties of n trimethyl chitosan tmc diclofenac sodium dc and diclofenac sodium loaded n trimethylchitosan nanoparticles dc tmcns and to determine suitable doses of gamma rays for sterilization of dc tmcns
8604,physicochemical properties of tmc dc and dc tmcns before and after exposure to gamma rays at various doses were investigated
8605,it was found that gamma irradiation at doses of kgy did not cause any significant changes in physical and chemical properties of tmc dc and dc tmcns
8606,the bioburden of dc tmcns was
8607,effective adsorption of pharmaceuticals and then degradation of them in the regeneration process are attractive for their complete removal from water or wastewater
8608,the adsorption of diclofenac sodium ds on the prepared carbon nanotubes polytetrafluorethylene cnts ptfe anode was enhanced in the presence of applied voltage
8609,compared with open circuit adsorption the initial adsorption rate and adsorbed amount of ds in static adsorption experiments increased and times respectively
8610,after adsorption the cnts ptfe anode was changed to cathode to in situ degrade the adsorbed ds and all ds was degraded after min using the electro peroxone treatment
8611,the mineralization efficiency increased with increasing ozone concentrations and current intensity and complete mineralization of ds was achieved at ma and mg l o
8612,local drug delivery is a non surgical method in the treatment of periodontitis
8613,different chemotherapeutic agents are used for local drug delivery one such agent is tetracycline a broad spectrum antibiotic
8614,recent studies have also shown that the use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs reduces pro inflammatory cytokines and acts as host modulator
8615,thus an attempt was made to compare and evaluate the efficacy of tetracycline alone and in combination with diclofenac sodium as a local drug delivery
8616,a total of sites with chronic periodontitis were divided into three groups with sites each i e
8617,group a antibiotics alone group b antibiotics in combination with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and group c control group
8618,for all the groups the following parameters plaque index papillary bleeding index probing pocket depth and microbial analysis were assessed and statistically analyzed
8619,the antibiotic and non steroidal anti inflammatory drug combination group showed a statistically significant improvement in clinical parameters and a shift in microbial flora when compared to the group with antibiotics alone
8620,however the control group failed to show any statistically significant improvement
8621,antibiotics in combination with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are more efficient than using antibiotics alone as local drug delivery for the treatment of periodontal pockets
8622,actinic keratosis is a frequent lesion which occurs in sunlight exposed areas
8623,diclofenac sodium and fluorouracil are effective non invasive and easy to apply topical treatment options
8624,to assess and compare the effectiveness of diclofenac sodium associated with hyaluronic acid and of fluorouracil for the treatment of actinic keratosis as well as the patient s degree of satisfaction and tolerability
8625,patients with a clinical diagnosis of actinic keratosis were randomized to receive diclofenac sodium or fluorouracil and were clinically assessed before and after treatment as well as weeks after the end of treatment
8626,modified versions of the investigator and patient global improvement scores were used
8627,the average number of lesions in the diclofenac sodium group before and after treatment was and p respectively while it was and p in the fluorouracil group
8628,there was a significant reduction in the number of lesions in the fluorouracil group in relation to the diclofenac sodium group p
8629,to the non blinded physician there was a higher satisfactory therapeutic response in the fluorouracil group p to the blinded physician there was a higher satisfactory response in this same group although not statistically significant p
8630,there was a high degree of satisfaction in both groups in the diclofenac sodium group and in the fluorouracil group p
8631,regarding adverse effects the diclofenac sodium group presented a higher degree of satisfaction vs p
8632,erythema edema crusts and itching were significantly higher in the fluorouracil group
8633,we concluded that fluorouracil was more effective however it showed lower tolerability than diclofenac sodium
8634,the objective of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of etodolac injection and diclofenac injection in patients with postoperative orthopedic pain
8635,this was multicentric randomized assessor blind and parallel group study
8636,a group of patients with moderate to severe pain following orthopedic surgery were randomly assigned to receive either etodolac mg twice a day n or diclofenac mg thrice a day n
8637,the primary efficacy outcome measures were pain intensity difference sum of pain intensity differences and pain relief whereas secondary efficacy variables included maximum fall in pain intensity number of doses of study medication consumed number of patients who required rescue medication and overall response to therapy
8638,mean pain intensity differences assessed on cm vas were significantly better for etodolac arm compared to diclofenac arm at and hours p
8639,sum of pain intensity differences over the first hours for etodolac vs for diclofenac p and over the hours for etodolac vs for diclofenac p for the etodolac group was significantly superior than diclofenac group
8640,assessment of pain relief showed that etodolac injection was significantly more effective than diclofenac injection p over the hour assessment period
8641,maximum fall in pain intensity score number of doses of study medication consumed and patients and investigators overall response to the drug at the end of treatment period were also significantly superior in the etodolac arm as compared to the diclofenac arm p
8642,however the number of patients who were rescued was comparable in both the treatment arms
8643,a change in emotional functioning of the patients was not captured in this study
8644,both the study medications were well tolerated with no incidence of sae throughout the study
8645,etodolac can be considered as an effective alternative to traditional nsaids in the treatment of post operative pain
8646,the pharmacokinetic analysis of an oral sustained release preparation of diclofenac sodium has been investigated using multi segment absorption models in which it has been assumed that the gastrointestinal tract can be divided into several segments in each of which the drug has its own lag time and absorption rate constants
8647,plasma concentration time data for sustained release diclofenac sodium in man were fitted both by a conventional pharmacokinetic method assuming first order absorption and by a multi segment absorption model
8648,the plasma concentration of diclofenac sodium calculated on the basis of the multi segment absorption model was found to correlate with the observed plasma concentration
8649,it was concluded that diclofenac sodium data can be better described by a multi segment absorption model than by a conventional pharmacokinetic model
8650,the results also show that multi segment absorption models are suitable for pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma drug concentration data with irregular or multiple peaks in the absorption profiles and also for the pharmacokinetic analysis of sustained release preparations
8651,postoperative pain may be a significant reason for delayed discharge from hospital increased morbidity and reduced patient satisfaction with ambulatory hernia surgery
8652,this study compared two postoperative oral analgesic protocols after day case inguinal hernia repair mg morphine sulphate mst and mg metoclopramide every h for h or mg diclofenac twice daily for h the pain reported in the mst group was significantly greater on both the day of operation and the first postoperative day p mann whitney u test
8653,a significantly higher proportion of patients taking mst complained of nausea on the day of operation and on the st postoperative day p chi
8654,the time taken to walk dress and leave home alone were achieved in a significantly shorter duration in patients taking diclofenac
8655,we conclude that diclofenac provides effective analgesia has a more acceptable side effect profile than morphine sulphate and is the treatment of choice after ambulatory hernia surgery
8656,various treatment modalities have been used in primary nocturnal enuresis pne and pharmacotherapy is widely accepted
8657,prostaglandins increase detrusor pressure decrease urethral pressure and lead to sodium excretion
8658,they also antagonize hydro osmotic effect of vasopressin by competing with this hormone
8659,according to these functions of prostaglandins it is suggested that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may have value in the management of pne
8660,we evaluated the efficacy or oral diclofenac sodium treatment in patients
8661,we conclude that diclofenac sodium an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis is a good alternative agent for nocturnal enuresis particularly as a supplementary treatment combined to imipramine with complete response and recurrence rate
8662,the oil in water o w emulsion type ointment was prepared with food additives containing diclofenac sodium
8663,the oil phase and the emulsifier used were propanetriyl trioctanoate caprylic acid glyceryl ester and sugar wax and sugar ester respectively
8664,the emulsion stability of the o w emulsion type ointment as well as the diclofenac sodium release profile were investigated and compared with those from conventional ointments
8665,the emulsion stability was evaluated in terms of the viscosity of the emulsion product the particle size distribution of oil droplets and the zeta potential of the droplets
8666,it was found that sugar esters have excellent properties as emulsifiers based on the results of viscosity and zeta potential measurements
8667,the in vitro release test revealed that the amount of diclofenac sodium released from o w emulsion type ointment was greater than from the hydrophilic and absorptive ointment
8668,accordingly it was concluded that o w emulsion type bases are suitable for pharmaceutical use in ointment products
8669,in multicenter double blind studies the efficacy and safety of diclofenac mg day were compared with those of aspirin g day in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ra in study and with those of naproxen mg day in patients with ra in study after single blind placebo washout periods of days to weeks patients entered week treatment periods in each study
8670,in both studies diclofenac aspirin and naproxen produced statistically significant improvement p less than or equal to from baseline in all primary efficacy variables at each assessment visit
8671,there were no significant differences between treatments
8672,in both studies significantly fewer p less than or equal to patients receiving diclofenac experienced adverse effects compared to the aspirin and naproxen groups
8673,significantly fewer p less than patients in the diclofenac group compared to the aspirin group discontinued the trial due to side effects primarily tinnitus and deafness
8674,in study fewer patients in the diclofenac group discontinued the trial due to adverse effects than in the naproxen group
8675,in conclusion diclofenac aspirin and naproxen demonstrated similar efficacy however diclofenac was significantly better tolerated than either aspirin or naproxen
8676,the objective of this research was to study the effect of diclofenac sodium compartmentalization on the physico chemical properties such as size drug entrapment efficiency and percutaneous permeation across rabbit skin of niosomal vesicles used as carriers
8677,niosomes were prepared starting from nonionic commercial surfactants belonging to the class of polysorbates and pluronics mixtures of span f and tween f at different ratios were used to obtain vesicles and all formulations were compared in terms of dimensions morphology polydispersity index and entrapment efficiency
8678,moreover the enhancing effect of niosomes on the ex vivo percutaneous penetration of diclofenac sodium was investigated using franz type diffusion chambers and compared to that obtained by using the corresponding drug solution
8679,results demonstrated that niosomes were spherical and homogeneous in shape
8680,their size was found to be dependent on the hydrophile lipophile balance of the surfactant mixture increasing hydrophobicity resulted in smaller vesicles
8681,drug incorporation led to a significant variation in vesicle size dependently from the compartment in which the drug was located
8682,the permeation of diclofenac from free solution used as control was found to be lower respect to that obtained for all niosomal formulations that can be considered as percutaneous permeation enhancers
8683,in particular the results indicated that the highest cumulative amounts of diclofenac permeated across rabbit skin after h were obtained by formulations in which the drug was located in the aqueous core
8684,the objective of the present study was to design an oral controlled drug delivery system for sparingly soluble diclofenac sodium dcl using guar gum as triple layer matrix tablets
8685,matrix tablet granules containing d d or d of guar gum were prepared by the conventional wet granulation technique
8686,matrix tablets of diclofenac sodium were prepared by compressing three layers one by one
8687,centre layer of sandwich like structure was incorporated with matrix granules containing dcl which was covered on either side by guar gum granule layers containing either or of guar gum as release retardant layers
8688,the tablets were evaluated for hardness thickness drug content and drug release studies
8689,to ascertain the kinetics of drug release the dissolution profiles were fitted to various mathematical models
8690,the in vitro drug release from proposed system was best explained by the hopfenberg model indicating that the release of drug from tablets displayed heterogeneous erosion
8691,dg containing of guar gum in guar gum layers and of guar gum in dcl matrix granule layer was found to provide the release rate for prolonged period of time
8692,the results clearly indicate that guar gum could be a potential hydrophilic carrier in the development of oral controlled drug delivery systems
8693,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs decrease the glomerular filtration rate
8694,however few studies have been conducted on renal function in patients treated with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs during the first week after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy
8695,the purpose of this study is to determine whether short term administration of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs during the first week after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is a risk factor for impaired renal function
8696,renal carcinoma patients undergoing laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in nagoya university hospital from april to july were identified in a retrospective cohort study

8698,elderly patients years old in the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug treated group showed a significant correlation between the residual renal function ratio and the total dose of diclofenac sodium r p
8699,there was no significant correlation between the residual renal function ratio and the total dose of loxoprofen sodium
8700,the time to doubling of the serum creatinine level was significantly shorter in elderly patients treated with diclofenac sodium compared with that in patients treated with non non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs p
8701,these results suggest that renal ischemia induced by short term administration of diclofenac sodium impairs renal function in elderly patients after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy
8702,in the present study we found the first evidence that short term administration of diclofenac sodium is one risk factor for renal impairment after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in elderly patients
8703,to prevent renal impairment after laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in elderly patients the use of loxoprofen sodium which has a negligible effect on renal function compared with diclofenac sodium is recommended

8792,the recordings were made once a day at the same time using a patient completed questionnaire
8793,eighty one patients were finally included in the study
8794,the results were similar in the first postoperative hours in both groups though on the third day the diclofenac group tended to show higher pain scores the differences being nonsignificant however p
8795,this tendency was also reflected by an increased need for rescue medication and the consumption of a larger number of tablets in the diclofenac group
8796,there were no statistically significant differences in analgesic efficacy between diclofenac sodium and ibuprofen though the former was associated with an increased need for supplementary medication in the first two postoperative days p
8797,controlled release solid dispersions of diclofenac sodium ds were prepared by freeze drying technique using ethylcellulose ec and chitosan cs as single and combined carriers
8798,factorial design was applied as an experimental design to study the main and interactive effects of ec and cs on drug dissolution from the controlled release solid dispersion

8804,the solid dispersion capsule containing explotab was found to provide the most similar dissolution profile to the one obtained with the ds ec cs solid dispersion powder
8805,the dissolutions of the solid dispersion powder and capsules were closer to a first order model than to a zero order or diffusion control model
8806,a study was carried out in healthy subjects to compare the faecal blood loss caused by pirazolac a new non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and diclofenac sodium using chromium labelled red blood cells
8807,after week on placebo subjects received at random either mg pirazolac times daily or mg diclofenac sodium times daily for days
8808,they were then crossed over to the alternative medication for a further days preceded and followed by week on placebo
8809,stool samples were collected and bulked for each day and total blood loss over days days on treatment and days immediately after was calculated for each period

8814,plasma concentrations of diclofenac df increased with increasing amounts of l menthol in the gel ointment
8815,l menthol had no effect on the solubility and partition coefficient of dfs suggesting that the thermodynamic nature of dfs in the formulation was not greatly affected
8816,plasma concentrations of df arising from application of ointments containing varying amounts of the terpene were predicted from found pharmacokinetic parameters and the steady state flux of dfs obtained from in vitro permeation experiments
8817,experimentally determined plasma concentration of df agreed well with the predictions indicating that steady state flux in vitro well reflects percutaneous absorption in vivo
8818,in some situations the cause of the supposed neuropathic pain might be related to abnormal tissue recovery such as scar formation due to wound retraction that might create mechanical compression on the nerve tissue
8819,in this report we describe infiltration block with diclofenac sodium and lidocaine through the hypertrophic scar tissue to reduce mechanical stress in patients
8820,the infiltration technique might resolve the tension of the contracted scar tissue by tearing the adhesions and the eliminated mechanical compression would reduce the pressure on nerve tissue and hence neuropathic pain symptoms

8857,patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy treated with two sessions of panretinal photocoagulation group a and patients with non proliferative diabetic retinopathy who underwent grid treatment of the posterior pole bilaterally group b
8858,sodium diclofenac or sodium chloride drops were topically applied minutes before laser treatment in a masked fashion
8859,patients who had two sessions were given the alternate drug in the second one
8860,pain level was evaluated immediately after laser treatment with the visual analogue scale vas
8861,the results were statistically analysed
8862,patients in group a reported pain in sessions
8863,the average pain level was with sodium diclofenac drops and with sodium chloride drops p by paired t test
8864,patients in group b reported pain in only sessions
8865,and the pain level ranged from to regardless of the kind of drops used
8866,there was no correlation in either group between level of pain and time interval from application of the drops to laser treatment minutes or average energy level used mw
8867,sodium diclofenac is useful for pain reduction and should be applied before panretinal photocoagulation
8868,a double blind randomized study was performed to compare ionization with diclofenac sodium mg and ionization with saline solution in two groups of patients with scapulo humeral periarthritis or elbow epicondylitis
8869,the subjects of both groups were treated with ionization sessions each lasting minutes during a month period
8870,there was a significantly greater improvement in pain at rest pain on pressure pain on movement and joint swelling in the eleven patients treated with diclofenac compared with the thirteen placebo treated patients but no significant differences between the two treatments as regards functional impairment
8871,however placebo treatment produced a slight but significant improvement in pain on pressure pain on movement and functional impairment
8872,further studies are needed to assess the relative role of the current and of autosuggestion in saline ionization response since both have well known therapeutic effects on chronic rheumatic pain
8873,in a double blind controlled clinical study patients of whom were subjected to mastectomy or quadrantectomy and to inguinal hernioplasty were randomly assigned to two treatment groups of subjects each balanced by type of operation
8874,treatment lasted days and involved the administration of suppositories per day of nimesulide or diclofenac sodium
8875,independently of the type of operation a significant reduction in pain symptomatology spontaneous pain pain on active and passive movements and in inflammatory symptomatology hyperaemia and tumefaction and a good control of body temperature was observed for both treatment groups
8876,no changes in arterial pressure or laboratory examinations were observed in either group nor there were any noteworthy adverse reactions
8877,the effects of diclofenac sodium and naproxen on the gastric mucosa were studied in a double blind trial by gastroscopy gastrophotography and histological examination of the mucosa in six healthy volunteers
8878,detectable lesions were evident in the mucosa of four subjects after administration of both drugs and the lesions were more extensive after the ingestion of naproxen than after diclofenac sodium in all of these cases
8879,the most serious lesions verified by both gastroscopy and histology always occurred after exposure to naproxen
8880,the histology of the gastric mucosa of two subjects with severe lesions showed spotty to moderate chronic superficial gastritis whereas the overall histological appearance of the mucosa was normal in subjects with slight or moderate lesions after drug administration
8881,the maximal acid output was positively correlated with the severity of the lesions
8882,subjective symptoms occurred in one person during diclofenac sodium and in three during naproxen administration
8883,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are particularly used in patients with bone fractures but there are limited studies on whether one nsaid is superior to another
8884,in this study we used histopathological and biochemical parameters to determine whether there are differences between the effects of the administration of clinical doses of dexketoprofen trometamol dext meloxicam mel and diclofenac sodium dic on the healing of closed fibular fractures and the toxicity of both the liver and kidney
8885,twenty eight male sprague dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups of seven each
8886,closed diaphyseal fractures were formed in the left fibulas of all of the rats
8887,the nsaids dexketoprofen trometamol dext arveles meloxicam mel melox and diclofenac sodium dic voltaren were intramuscularly administered to groups i ii and iii respectively for a period of days after the fibular fractures were performed
8888,no pharmacological agents were administered to group iv control group
8889,blood samples were collected from all of the rats after the fractures were performed and the rats were sacrificed on day the histopathological findings were compared and the blood samples were evaluated to determine any differences between the levels of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and malondialdehyde mda
8890,our results suggest that dext and mel impair the healing of bone fractures and that dic does not histopathologically affect the healing process of bone fractures
8891,we also found that dext mel and dic impaired the renal histopathology compared with the control group
8892,however the liver histopathological analysis showed that dext and mel caused a higher degree of parenchymal necrosis compared with dic
8893,based on our results dic can be considered a relatively safe medication in patients with fractures
8894,recent research into the complex and varied components of rheumatoid arthritis ra is leading to the development of more effective targets for pharmaceutical approach than even before
8895,current treatment of ra frequently includes the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac sodium dfna in spite of the severe adverse effects
8896,local application and incorporation of the drugs in liposome based formulations may reduce those side effects and improve the efficacy of drugs by reducing the availability of them in systemic circulation and increasing accumulation and retention time in the sites of inflammation
8897,herein anti inflammatory efficacy of the dfna containing lipogelosome formulations lj was evaluated and found that lj elicits a better anti inflammatory efficacy after a single dose i a
8898,administration in comparison with commercial product ve cp which is used topically
8899,histopathological examination of the opened joints showed that joints treated with lj had significantly p lower scores than contra lateral control joints for inflammatory changes in the synovium
8900,these results were also confirmed by biodistribution studies
8901,to establish the role of preoperative subconjunctival mydricaine and diclofenac in maintaining mydriasis during vitrectomy
8902,fifty seven patients were entered into the study
8903,all were given cyclopentolate and phenylephrine preoperatively
8904,each patient was randomly allocated to one of three groups
8905,in group patients received mydricaine by subconjunctival injection and diclofenac topically preoperatively
8906,in group patients received only subconjunctival mydricaine
8907,group patients received only topical diclofenac preoperatively
8908,pupil diameter was measured with calipers before and at the end of the operation
8909,there was no statistically significant difference in the change in pupil size between groups and in all patients in group who received both subconjunctival mydricaine and diclofenac preoperatively pupil size was either maintained or increased after vitrectomy
8910,this result was statistically significant when compared with the other groups for group versus group p for group versus group p x
8911,topical diclofenac is useful for maintaining pupil size during vitrectomy only when used in conjunction with subconjunctival mydricaine especially in patients in whom prolonged surgery is anticipated
8912,in a double blind study diclofenac sodium voltaren administered for days in a dosage of mg t i d was compared with naproxen mg b i d
8913,for days in the treatment of patients with soft tissue rheumatism
8914,assessment of the efficacy of the two treatments was based upon changes recorded once a week in the following parameters pain at rest and on movement swelling local tenderness functional impairment limitation of movement and sleep disturbances
8915,the incidence of unwanted effects was also recorded and the effects themselves were classified according to the probability of their being causally related to the trial preparations
8916,both drugs appeared to be effective in relieving symptoms associated with soft tissue rheumatism
8917,in most indications the therapeutic efficacy of the two preparations was similar

8928,polyethylene glycol peg molecular weight is and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds were used as the release rate modifiers
8929,for the pla peg ds blends the release of ds was enhanced with higher amounts of peg and ds
8930,after the addition of sds to the pla peg ds blends the dispersion of ds and peg was significantly improved
8931,compared to the pla peg ds blends with the same drug loading the drug release behavior of pla peg ds sds was remarkably suppressed due to the presence of sds
8932,and a controllable linear release of ds was achieved
8933,to compare the effects of intrauterine lidocaine intrauterine lidocaine plus rectal diclofenac and a placebo on analgesia and to determine the satisfaction of patients and surgeons in cases of endometrial biopsy

8951,microbeads for oral controlled delivery of diclofenac sodium were successfully developed by ionotropic gelation
8952,two different transdermal diclofenac cas formulations olfen patch mg diclofenac sodium as test preparation and mg diclofenac epolamine plaster equivalent to mg diclofenac sodium as reference preparation were investigated in healthy male and female volunteers in order to compare the transdermal bioavailability between both treatments following topical multiple dose administration
8953,subjects were applied plasters of test and reference formulation at a dose interval of h for consecutive days
8954,test and reference preparation were administered in randomised sequence at a marked spot at the left upper arm under non fasting conditions
8955,for determination of diclofenac concentrations pre dose trough values were taken during steady state build up and during the period of switch over between both preparations on days and blood samples for pharmacokinetic profiling were taken on days and at pre defined time points up to h following drug administration after the th resp
8957,treatments were not separated by a wash out phase
8958,considering the short half life of diclofenac it was appropriate that a switch over design was chosen without wash out periods between treatments
8959,diclofenac plasma concentrations were determined by means of a validated lc ms ms method limit of detection ng ml lower limit of quantification ng ml
8960,for the test preparation maximum plasma concentrations of ng ml c max ng ml c max and ng ml c max as well as areas under the plasma concentration time curve auc of ng x h ml auc ng x h ml auc and ng x h ml auc were determined
8961,for the reference preparation these values were ng ml c max ng ml c max and ng ml c max as well as ng x h ml auc ng x h ml auc and ng x h ml auc
8962,for the test preparation peak to trough fluctuations ptf of ptf ptf and ptf were observed
8963,corresponding values for the reference preparation were ptf ptf and ptf
8964,in order to evaluate comparable bioavailability of both preparations confidence intervals of the test reference ratios were determined
8965,thereby for all dose intervals considered and all auc parameters calculated the extent of diclofenac absorption from the test preparation markedly exceeds those values obtained for the reference preparation
8966,likewise maximum plasma concentrations as a measure for the rate of absorption were higher after the test preparation
8967,with respect to peak to trough fluctuation of plasma diclofenac levels both plaster preparations were comparable for the morning dose interval h as well as for the h period
8968,the relative efficacy of rofecoxib diclofenac sodium and placebo were compared in the treatment of acute pain after bunionectomy surgery
8969,this was a double blind randomized two part study of patients with moderate to severe pain the day after first metatarsal bunionectomy
8970,patients were treated with a single dose of rofecoxib mg n enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg n or placebo n on study day part i and subsequently with daily rofecoxib mg or placebo diclofenac patients switched to placebo over study days part ii
8971,patients rated their pain at time points over the first h primary endpoint was total pain relief over h topar
8972,pre specified secondary endpoints on day included onset of analgesia peak pain relief and duration of response
8973,for part ii supplemental analgesia use with rofecoxib compared to placebo was pre specified for analysis over days with the focus on days adverse experiences were recorded over days
8974,for topar scores rofecoxib mg was significantly more effective than placebo vs p and diclofenac vs p
8975,onset of analgesia was more rapid with rofecoxib than placebo p and diclofenac p proportion of patients achieving onset within h with rofecoxib diclofenac and placebo was and respectively
8976,peak pain relief was greater with rofecoxib than diclofenac p and placebo p
8977,diclofenac and placebo patients required supplemental analgesia sooner than rofecoxib patients h vs h p and h vs h p
8978,rofecoxib patients used significantly less p supplemental analgesia than placebo patients over days tablets day vs tablets day and days tablets day vs tablets day
8979,no significant differences in adverse experiences between treatments were seen
8980,rofecoxib mg was significantly more effective than placebo on all measures of treatment of post bunionectomy pain
8981,rofecoxib mg was significantly more effective than diclofenac sodium mg based on day endpoints of total pain relief onset time and duration of response
8982,all study medications were generally well tolerated
8983,diclofenac sodium is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug with analgesic antipyretic and anti inflammatory activity
8984,when used in a topical application diclofenac can diffuse through the skin and into the subcutaneous tissue to effect the anti inflammatory action
8985,in this study in vitro evaluations of the percutaneous transport of diclofenac sodium in various bases containing fatty alcohols propylene glycol or fatty acid propylene glycol mixtures through the abdominal skin of the rabbit were investigated
8986,results show that the transdermal flux of diclofenac sodium in the fatty alcohol propylene glycol bases of the same ratio is affected by the chain length of the fatty alcohol and its effect is in the order of c c c c
8987,however the transdermal flux of diclofenac sodium in the fatty acid propylene glycol bases of the same ratio is also affected by the chain length of the fatty acid but no absolute relationship was found
8988,for the same chain length of fatty acid and fatty alcohol used in the formulation base that was otherwise the same the transdermal flux of diclofenac sodium is higher in the formula containing fatty alcohol than that containing fatty acid
8989,this study evaluates the relationship and influence of formulation and technological factors such as drug hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hpmc ratio particle size of the drug particle size of hpmc and compression force on drug release from matrices containing hpmc and diclofenac sodium as a model drug
8990,the influence of these variables was assessed by multi way analysis of variance
8991,the results of the present study point out that the rate and mechanism of diclofenac sodium release from hpmc km matrices are mainly controlled by the drug hpmc ratio
8992,the drug and hpmc particle size also influence the drug release parameters although to a lesser extent
8993,finally the independence of the drug release from matrix tablets with respect to the compression force is reported
8994,the objective of the present study was to investigate changes in colon wall in rats with fecal peritonitis per associated with sodium diclofenac sd by studying breaking strength and tissue collagen concentration
8995,the rats were divided into the following experimental groups group sd animals injected intramuscularly with sodium diclofenac at the dose of mg kg body weight group per animals injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of human feces
8996,peritonitis was interrupted after six hours of evolution group per sd animals injected intraperitoneally with a suspension of human feces and receiving sd according to the schedule used for groups and
8997,animals injected intramuscularly with physiological saline
8998,the animals of group and were successively sacrificed and days after interruption of peritonitis an or the beginning of treatment
8999,under conditions of the experimental model and of the methods used we conclude that sodium diclofenac peritonitis and the peritonitis sodium diclofenac association decrease the breaking strength and the concentration of tissue collagen in the colon segment
9000,drug drug interaction between a commercial diclofenac sodium enteric coated tablet voltaren v and a ranitidine hcl tablet zantac z was evaluated using a dual radiotelemetric technique according to a randomized three way latin square crossover design balanced for carryover effects
9001,v and z were given either alone or in combination treatment v z v z with a day washout period between treatments
9002,eighteen fasted subjects swallowed a tethered
9003,heidelberg ph capsule to provide continuous gastric ph
9004,then the assigned treatment drug and another heidelberg ph capsule were given simultaneously
9005,the free ph capsule provided information regarding gastric residence time grt
9006,serial blood samples were obtained for up to hr after dosing and drug levels were determined by validated hplc methods
9007,treatment effects on auc cmax tmax tlag tmax tlag and t were not significant except cmax which differed slightly for both v and z when given in combination as compared to alone
9008,gastric residence times were and min for treatments v z and v z respectively
9009,gastric exposure of the enteric coated tablet of diclofenac was estimated by ph values obtained from the tethered capsule
9010,median ph values at and min prior to gastric emptying were and for the combination treatment versus and for diclofenac alone
9011,the results of this study indicated that there was minimal drug drug interaction between diclofenac and ranitidine
9012,the gastric ph range resulting from this study did not influence the oral absorption of enteric coated diclofenac
9013,diclofenac sodium and alginate was intercalated into montmorillonite to form uniform sized beads by gelation method
9014,the structure and surface morphology of the synthesized composite beads were characterized by powdered x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy thermo gravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy
9015,diclofenac release kinetics of the composite in simulated intestinal fluid medium ph and effect of montmorillonite content on the in vitro release of diclofenac from diclofenac montmorillonite alginate composites bead was investigated by uv vis spectrophotometer
9016,diclofenac encapsulation efficiency in the montmorillonite alginate composites bead increases with an increase in the montmorillonite content
9017,the control release of diclofenac from diclofenac montmorillonite alginate composites beads was observed to be better as compared to diclofenac alginate beads
9019,to compare the gastrointestinal gi tolerability safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with osteoarthritis oa
9020,in total patients mean age yrs diagnosed with oa were enrolled in a randomized double blind trial
9021,patients received etoricoxib mg qd n or diclofenac sodium mg tid n
9022,gastroprotective agents and low dose aspirin were prescribed per treatment guidelines
9023,the primary endpoint was the cumulative rate of discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory gi adverse experiences ae
9024,general safety was assessed including adjudication of thrombotic cardiovascular cv safety data
9025,efficacy was evaluated using the least square ls mean change from baseline patient global assessment of disease status pgads point scale
9026,mean sd maximum duration of treatment was and months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups respectively
9027,the cumulative discontinuation rate due to gi ae was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac vs events per patient years py respectively hazard ratio hr ci p
9028,rates of thrombotic cv events were similar with etoricoxib and diclofenac vs events per py respectively hr ci
9029,the incidence of patients who discontinued due to hypertension related ae was significantly higher with etoricoxib compared to diclofenac vs p although few ae were severe etoricoxib diclofenac
9030,etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar improvements in pgads from baseline of ci and ci respectively
9031,treatment with etoricoxib mg was associated with significantly better gi tolerability compared to diclofenac in this population of patients with oa
9032,etoricoxib mg a dose higher than indicated for oa resulted in more discontinuations due to hypertension related ae
9033,the present study was aimed at developing a novel sodium diclofenac formulation for colonic release
9034,the proposed delivery system consisted in a polymeric matrix tablet containing a drug central core purposely designed for obtaining a time controlled release profile characterized by an initial phase of lag time followed by a controlled release phase according to zero order kinetics
9035,the spheric central core was formed by a solid dispersion of the drug into the hydrophilic polymer peg which enabled an improvement of drug dissolution properties with respect to other carriers such as lactose
9036,eudragit rs was used as inert polymeric matrix for the core coating mixed w w with sodium chloride and emdex as channeling agents
9037,tablets containing the drug central core were prepared by direct compression without any other excipient and tested for dissolution properties according to the usp paddle method under ph gradient conditions
9038,for both series of formulations lag times increased with decreasing the channeling agent particle size as a consequence of the smaller pores formed by its dissolution
9039,however formulations containing sodium chloride always showed longer lag times than the corresponding with emdex and were more effective in providing prolonged zero order release periods
9040,this was mainly attributed to the plastic deformation properties under compression shown by sodium chloride leading to a less porous more compact network which more strictly controlled solvent penetration and drug dissolution and release rates
9041,by varying the sodium chloride eudragit w w ratio it was possible to suitably modulate the length of both the lag time for achieving colonic targeting and zero order release phases
9042,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of formulation on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac in two sustained release formulations formulation a and voltaren sr after oral delivery
9043,the dissolution of diclofenac from sustained release formulation was ph dependent
9044,while drug released from both formulations increased with increased ph the release kinetics of these two formulations was different
9045,the pharmacokinetic study was conducted in healthy subjects administered with multiple doses of mg of diclofenac in a crossover design
9046,there was a significant difference in area under the plasma concentration time curve auc and c max observed
9047,the formulation with a reduced diffusion exponent with increased kinetic constant results in increased absorption of diclofenac in vivo
9048,this study demonstrated the impact of release mechanism of the formulation on the absorption in vivo
9049,the use of natural polymers for design of dosage form has received considerable attention recently especially from the safety point of view
9050,among these polymers chitosan shows very interesting biological chemical and physical properties which makes it possible to use chitosan for various pharmaceutical applications
9051,microcrystalline chitosan mcch is a special multifunctional polymeric material existing in the form of either of gelatinous water dispersion or a powder
9052,thermal aging of chitosan and chitosan diclofenac sodium mixture have been studied using low frequency dielectric measurements
9053,the aging was carried out by annealing in ambient atmosphere in the temperature range between degrees c and degrees c the dielectric losses in the aged samples proved to decrease by about one order of magnitude
9054,the additional measurements of molecular weight distribution and infrared absorption were also carried out for better understanding of nature of the ageing phenomena
9055,partial evacuation of water cross linking and improvement of structural order may be suggested to be a result of thermal aging of the investigated materials
9056,a selective semi automated solid phase extraction spe of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac sodium indomethacin and phenylbutazone from urine prior to high performance liquid chromatography was investigated
9057,the drugs were recovered from urine buffered at ph using c bond elut cartridges as solid sorbent material and mixtures of methanol aqueous buffer or acetonitrile aqueous buffer as washing and elution solvents
9058,the extracts were chromatographed on a reversed phase ods column using mm acetate buffer ph acetonitrile v v as the mobile phase and the effluent from the column was monitored at nm with ultraviolet detection
9059,absolute recoveries of the anti inflammatory drugs within the range microg ml were about for diclofenac and indomethacin and for phenylbutazone without any interference from endogenous compounds of the urine
9060,the within day and between day repeatabilities were in all cases less than and respectively
9061,limits of detection were microg ml for diclofenac sodium and indomethacin and microg ml for phenylbutazone whereas limits of quantitation were microg ml for diclofenac and indomethacin and microg ml for phenylbutazone
9062,sodium diclofenac a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor was recently shown to inhibit arachidonic acid conversion to leukotriene products in human leukocytes
9063,this activity was confirmed by radioimmunoassay in calcium ionophore a stimulated leukocytes isolated from the rat peritoneal cavity and human peripheral blood
9064,studies with rat peritoneal leukocytes revealed that this effect was not mediated by inhibition of lipoxygenase or phospholipase a but rather through modulation of arachidonic acid uptake and release
9065,the potency of this effect was dependent upon cell type macrophages being more sensitive to the drug than neutrophils
9066,in leukocytes treated with sodium diclofenac arachidonic acid released from phospholipids in response to a challenge was reincorporated into triacylglycerols
9067,the drug enhanced the spontaneous uptake of arachidonic acid into the cellular triacylglycerol pool and in this manner decreased the availability of intracellular arachidonic acid
9068,therefore sodium diclofenac in addition to inhibition of cyclooxygenase regulates leukotriene production of inflammatory cells by a mechanism mediated in part through the redistribution of arachidonic acid in lipid pools
9069,a radiotelemetric technique with the heidelberg capsule hc was used to improve the quality of data generated in a bioavailability study involving an enteric coated ec formulation
9070,further changes in plasma levels of the drug from other dosage forms were related to changes in ph environment as determined by the hc
9071,eight healthy male subjects received the following treatments min after a light breakfast according to a randomized four way crossover design a hc and mg of a diclofenac sodium aqueous buffered solution b hc and one mg voltaren ec tablet c hc and one mg voltaren slow release sr tablet and d hc alone
9072,each treatment was separated by a week washout period
9073,two additional subjects subsequently received treatment b only
9074,multiple peaks were observed in the drug plasma level time profiles for the buffered aqueous solution which in all cases occurred before gastric emptying of the hc
9075,the multiple peaks were not observed for the voltaren sr tablet but a variable absorption lag time occurred which coincided with the gastric residence time of the sr tablet
9076,for the ec tablet the variability of individual plasma level time profiles was drastically reduced when the time after dosing was adjusted to coincide with gastric emptying of the hc
9077,finally the lag time between gastric emptying of the ec tablet and the onset of drug absorption was consistently at hr for all subjects
9078,this lag time was longer than the in vitro disintegration or dissolution times measured under usp conditions
9079,adverse events associated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids used to treat knee and hand osteoarthritis may be more frequent in certain patient populations
9080,topical nsaids such as diclofenac sodium gel dsg have equivalent efficacy and fewer adverse events compared with oral nsaids
9081,this post hoc analysis assessed the long term tolerability of dsg in elderly patients and patients with an elevated risk of gastrointestinal cardiovascular and renal adverse events
9082,patients years of age with knee osteoarthritis applied dsg g to one or both knees for weeks during either of two primary studies and for months during a long term extension study
9083,other patients entered the long term extension study directly and applied dsg for months
9084,safety was assessed by reported adverse events
9085,subpopulations were defined based on age or the comorbidities of hypertension type diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease
9086,the safety population consisted of patients who received at least one dose of dsg during the primary or extension study
9087,patients aged years and years experienced any adverse event at similar rates
9088,the percentage of patients who experienced any adverse event was similar between patients with and without hypertension versus respectively type diabetes mellitus versus or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease versus
9089,among the patients with all three comorbidities the percentage of patients with any adverse event was less than that of patients who did not have all three comorbidities
9090,these results suggest that long term dsg treatment is safe in patient subpopulations with an elevated risk of nsaid related adverse events such as the elderly and those with the comorbidities of hypertension type diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease
9091,in a double blind between patient trial the efficacy and tolerability of two new non steroid anti inflammatory analgesics diclofenac sodium voltaren mg b i d
9092,and naproxen mg b i d were compared in hospitalised patients with rheumatoid arthritis
9093,both drugs had a clearly positive effect on the duration of morning stiffness bilateral grip strength pain at rest and pain on movement
9094,no statistically significant difference between the two drugs was found with respect to clinical efficacy
9095,three patients treated with diclofenac sodium reported unwanted effects as compared with seven patients receiving naproxen
9096,these unwated effects led to premature discontinuation of the treatment in one patient on naproxen
9097,thus although both drugs were well tolerated it appeared that diclofenac sodium caused somewhat fewer unwanted effects
9098,the present experimental study reports the performance of tea waste tw derived adsorbent for the adsorption of sodium diclofenac sd from aqueous solution sd concentration mg l
9099,the waste derived activated carbon was prepared by chemical activation process of raw waste using h
9100,patients frequently experience pain of moderate to severe degree during gynaecologic procedures
9101,this prospective randomized placebo controlled trial was aimed to investigate the analgesic efficacy of preoperative oral dexketoprofen trometamol intravenous paracetamol lidocaine spray pethidine and diclofenac sodium on fractional curettage procedure
9102,a total of multiparous women were randomly allocated to one of the six groups
9103,the first group control group consisted of participants and they did not receive any treatment
9104,the second group had participants receiving oral mg dexketoprofen trometamol
9105,the participants of the third group received two puff lidocaine sprays on cervical mucosa
9106,t he forth group consisted of participants receiving mg pethidine
9107,in the fifth group the participants received mg intravenous paracetamol and the sixth group consisted of participants receiving diclofenac sodium
9108,pethidine was the best choice for reducing pain score during curettage procedure t intra operative
9109,all analgesic procedures were significantly effective in reducing pain during postoperative period t
9110,significant pain reduction was achieved for both intra and postoperative period by using analgesics
9111,the results of our study showed that lidocaine puffs provided the best pain relief than the other analgesics used
9112,therefore lidocaine may be considered as the first choice analgesic in fractional curettage nct id
9113,the protective effect of licorice and diclofenac sodium in doses of mg kg bwt
9114,and mg kg bwt
9115,respectively against liver toxicity induced by ccl ml kg bwt
9116,in olive oil v v every other day for weeks and by hepatic ischemia reperfusion in adult male albino rats was studied
9117,different antioxidant and liver function parameters were reported to find the protective effect of both licorice and diclofenac sodium against hepatotoxicity
9118,results showed that licorice protected against ccl induced hepatotoxicity as well as ischemia reperfusion induced liver injury
9119,on the other hand diclofenac sodium caused deleterious effects especially in presence of ccl where a high mortality rate was observed
9120,the present study has been carried on changes in activity of alkaline phosphatase in serum and gastrocnemius muscle of mice after sub chronic use of diclofenac
9121,mice in experimental group received diclofenac mg kg body wt day for days while control group received normal saline
9122,alkaline phosphatase was assayed in muscle and serum and its activity was localized histochemically in muscle
9123,results showed that diclofenac induced changes in specific activity of alkaline phosphatase at different periods of treatment variably compared to control group
9124,specific activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly in gastrocnemius initially increased thereafter and slight decrease was noticed after days
9125,in serum the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase decreased slightly after days increased in the middle of the treatment period as well as showed increase compared to control group after days stage of investigation
9126,these findings were also confirmed by electrophoretic studies in muscle
9128,and bp have introduced a dissolution apparatus for suppositories
9129,suitability of the apparatus for quality control of indomethacin or sodium diclofenac mg compounded suppositories was evaluated and the effect of the type of suppository base on dissolution profiles was studied
9130,the fastest and most reproducible release profiles were observed for hydrophilic base macrogols
9131,more than of the drug was released during min while after min of the total amount was released from lipophilic bases witepsol and adeps solidus
9132,the results demonstrate that slow and non reproducible release occurs when the lipophilic suppository base does not melt
9133,the feasibility of the test for the formulations which do not melt during the procedure is questionable
9134,sodium diclofenac enteric coated microcapsules were prepared by a spray drying technique with eudragit l d as enteric coating material
9135,the spray dried powder mixed with neocel or flo starch or the mixture of neocel and flo starch weight ratio was directly compressed into a tablet
9136,the micromeritic properties of the spray dried powder and the mixed powder for tableting were investigated
9137,the flowability of the spray dried powder was poor but improved after incorporating the excipients
9138,the release rates of sodium diclofenac from the spray dried powder the mixed powder before tableting and the tablets were determined in n hcl solution ph phosphate buffer solution distilled water and ph changed medium
9139,the results indicated that the spray dried powder the mixed powder before tableting and the tablets all exhibited enteric coated release properties these powders and tablets showed some resistance to stimulated gastric acid and then released drug more rapidly in ph buffer solution
9140,the weight ratio of neocel to flo starch plays an important role in controlling the release of sodium diclofenac from enteric tablets
9141,the weight ratio of neocel to flo starch was more suitable for designing the microdispersed sodium diclofenac enteric coated tablets
9142,a short term trial has been performed under double blind conditions in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare diclofenac sodium voltaren with both indomethacin and placebo for efficacy and tolerability
9143,the duration of the trial was two weeks and was a between patient comparison of mg t i d

9146,forty eight patients completed the trial
9147,in the majority of parameters examined diclofenac sodium was superior to placebo and indomethacin in therapeutic effect
9148,one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of intolerance to indomethacin and one other because of severe joint pain under indomethacin therapy
9149,neither active compound caused clinically significant changes in blood picture or urine analysis
9150,the goal of the present study is to develop polymeric matrix films loaded with a combination of free diclofenac sodium dfs

9173,ophthalmological department san don di piave hospital venice italy
9174,forty consecutive patients men and women between and years of age mean age years who were scheduled for cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and iol implantation were randomized to receive piroxicam ophthalmic solution piroxicam group patients or diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution diclofenac group patients for month postoperatively
9175,best corrected visual acuity bcva and intraocular pressure iop measurements and slit lamp biomicroscopy for the evaluation of corneal edema descemet membrane folds tyndall and cells in the anterior chamber were carried out in all patients day days and month postoperatively
9176,subjective symptoms after the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid ophthalmic solution instillation were assessed using a questionnaire
9177,there were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative iop bcva anterior chamber flare and cell levels corneal edema or descemet membrane folds
9178,ocular discomfort evaluated as burning or stinging sensation after nsaid ophthalmic solution instillation was significantly more frequent and intense in the diclofenac treated eyes
9179,two eyes in the diclofenac group had a mild transient punctate keratitis
9180,these results suggest that piroxicam is as effective as diclofenac sodium in preventing inflammation after cataract surgery with iol implantation and its better tolerance and safety can provide higher patient compliance
9181,rectal poloxamer gel systems composed of poloxamers and bioadhesive polymers were easy to administer to the anus and were mucoadhesive to the rectal tissues without leakage after the dose
9182,however a poloxamer gel containing diclofenac sodium could not be developed using bioadhesive polymers since the drug was precipitated in this preparation
9183,to develop a poloxamer gel using sodium chloride instead of bioadhesive polymers the physicochemical properties such as gelation temperature gel strength and bioadhesive force of various formulations composed of diclofenac sodium poloxamers and sodium chloride were investigated
9184,furthermore the pharmacokinetic study of diclofenac sodium delivered by the poloxamer gel was performed
9185,diclofenac sodium significantly increased the gelation temperature and weakened the gel strength and bioadhesive force while sodium chloride did the opposite
9186,the poloxamer gels with less than sodium chloride in which the drug was not precipitated were inserted into the rectum without difficulty and leakage and were retained in the rectum of rats for at least hr
9187,furthermore poloxamer gel gave significantly higher initial plasma concentrations and faster tmax of diclofenac sodium than did solid suppository indicating that drug from poloxamer gel could be absorbed faster than that from the solid one in rats
9188,our results suggested that a rectal poloxamer gel system with sodium chloride and poloxamers was a more physically stable convenient and effective rectal dosage form for diclofenac sodium

9206,catanionic surfactant hydrotrope mixtures have proven to be a striking alternative to tune microstructures over a wide range of compositions and also to minimize precipitation that is normally observed in catanionic mixtures at an equimolar ratio
9207,these mixtures are supposed to be of great relevance in biological systems when a hydrotrope is a drug
9208,keeping this in view here we report composition and dilution induced structural changes in a catanionic mixture comprising ionic liquids ils such as dodecyl methylimidazolium bromide cmimbr tetradecyl methylimidazolium bromide cmimbr and a drug diclofenac sodium dfna in aqueous solution
9209,the structural changes are probed by small angle neutron scattering sans dynamic light scattering dls and zeta potential measurements
9210,sans data and size distribution curves clearly depict the formation of low curvature structures on going from the cation rich to anion rich composition up to a mole fraction of dfna xdfna
9211,the amphiphilic nature of dfna is supposed to alter the surface charge density which is provoked by its incorporation into resulting aggregates as confirmed by modified zeta potential values
9212,the modification of the average packing parameter resulting from the il and dfna complexation equilibrium seems to play a vital role in bringing out structural transitions of mixed aggregates
9213,we also focused our attention to study the effect of dilution in concentrations ranging from to mm
9214,at xdfna and the size of prolate ellipsoids decreases on dilution mimicking classic behavior but an opposite trend is observed at other xdfna values
9215,dilution induced transformation to larger aggregates is thought to be driven by the release of dfna molecules from the mixed micelles on account of the critical micelle concentration cmc solubility mismatch between the two components
9216,the role of other interactions such as cation and in stabilizing the mixed aggregates in addition to hydrophobic interactions is probed by h nmr

9224,the results of this study indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the logarithmically transformed auc infinity and cmax values of the two preparations
9225,the confidence interval for the ratio of logarithmically transformed auc t auc infinity and cmax were within the bioequivalence limit of and the relative bioavailability of rabeprazole and diclofenac sodium were found to be and respectively in the test product
9226,thus these findings clearly indicated that the two products are bioequivalent in terms of rate and extent of drug absorption

9394,the accuracy within day n and day to day n was the mean variation coefficient for inter n and intraday precision n was thus not exceeding
9395,this method can be used as an analytical procedure for the determination of diclofenac sodium in mem for in vitro permeation studies
9396,in a double blind crossover trial conducted on a multicentre basis patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis were treated for two weeks with diclofenac sodium voltaren mg t i d
9397,and indomethacin mg t i d
9398,both drugs led to a clear cut decrease in morning stiffness as well as to a significant improvement in pain at rest and on movement
9399,in these respects no significant difference between the two drugs was observed
9400,as regards their effect on status of rheumatoid condition however a trend towards a significant improvement was discernible in the investigator s opinion only in response to diclofenac sodium
9401,unwanted effects were mentioned by patients before the trial by during treatment with diclofenac sodium and by during treatment with indomethacin
9402,while the patients were receiving indomethacin five of them discontinued treatment on account of side effects headache in three cases headache and tiredness in one case and an allergic skin reaction in one case and one of them who complained of headache lowered the dosage treatment with diclofenac sodium was discontinued because of side effects by only one patient who had developed an allergic skin reaction

9406,the beyond use date of the products was found to be at least days for all suspensions except atenolol mg ml which was stable up to days both for controlled refrigerated temperature and room temperature
9407,this confirms that syrspend sf ph is a stable suspending vehicle for compounding with a broad range of different active pharmaceutical ingredients
9408,to compare the time to presentation of the analgetic and anti inflammatory effects of granulated and tablet nimesulide and sodium diclofenac since the start of therapy for gouty arthritis ga
9409,ninety males with gout were randomized into equal groups
9410,the patients were included in the study by the following criteria a documented diagnosis of gout wallace s criteria age over years acute arthritis for less than weeks affection of and more joints
9411,for days patients of group received nimesil mg day those of group aponil mg day group sodium diclofenac mg day
9412,swelling articular pain indices were estimated daily for days
9413,patients of group nimesil experienced pain relief on min patients taking nimesulide aponil experienced pain attenuation within the first hour
9414,pain at rest and movement and the indices declined faster in group than in group as well as in groups and compared to group arthritis was arrested in patients of group of group and of group
9415,efficacy of nimesulide for arrest of an acute gout attack exceeds that of sodium diclofenac
9416,granulated nimesulide has advantages over tablets
9417,the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide were assessed in a randomized study versus diclofenac sodium in the treatment of patients affected with acute superficial thrombophlebitis
9418,both drugs administered in a dose of tablet b i d
9419,for days evidenced a prompt and effective analgesic and anti inflammatory activity
9420,particularly the tolerability of nimesulide was excellent
9421,to develop a poloxamer based solid suppository with poloxamer mixtures the melting point of various formulations composed of poloxamer p and poloxamer p were investigated
9422,the dissolution and pharmacokinetic study of diclofenac sodium delivered by the poloxamer based suppository were performed
9423,furthermore the identification test in the rectum and morphology test of rectal tissues were carried out after its rectal administration in rats
9424,the poloxamer mixtures composed of p and p were homogeneous phases
9425,very small amounts of p affected the melting point of poloxamer mixtures
9426,in particular the poloxamer mixture p p with the melting point of about degrees c was a solid form at room temperature and instantly melted at physiological temperature
9427,very small amounts of p hardly affected the dissolution rates of diclofenac sodium from the suppository
9428,dissolution mechanism analysis showed the dissolution of diclofenac sodium was proportional to the time
9429,the poloxamer based suppository gave significantly higher initial plasma concentrations and faster t max of diclofenac sodium than did conventional peg based suppository indicating that the drug from poloxamer based suppository could be absorbed faster than that from peg based one in rats
9430,it retained in the rectum for at least h and could not irritate or damage the rectal tissues of rats
9431,thus the poloxamer based solid suppository with p and p was a mucoadhesive safe and effective rectal dosage form for diclofenac sodium
9432,to study the therapeutic effects of a single mg intramuscular dose of piroxicam versus a single mg intramuscular dose of diclofenac sodium for treatment of acute renal colic
9433,the study comprised patients men and women mean age years range who presented with acute renal colic and were diagnosed by ivu a general urine examination and ultrasonography
9434,the patients were randomly assigned to receive either mg of piroxicam i m patients or mg of diclofenac sodium i m patients
9435,the severity of pain was assessed on visual analogue scale
9436,results showed that thirty two patients markedly improved within h of receiving piroxicam and patients improved within h of receiving diclofenac sodium p
9437,within min patients markedly improved after piroxicam and patients markedly improved after diclofenac sodium p
9438,after piroxicam none of the patients showed pain relapse over a period of h while patients had relapse within h after their initial response to diclofenac sodium
9439,no side effects were reported with use of either treatment
9440,we concluded that piroxicam can be used successfully to treat acute renal colic and it has earlier onset of action and prolong effect as compared with diclofenac sodium
9441,the relationship between serum triacylglycerol concentration and hepatic microsomal enzyme activity was examined in rats
9442,two groups of rats were injected with diclofenac sodium at doses of and mg day kg
9443,a third group was injected with phenylbutazone at a dose of mg day kg
9444,the treatment was continued for days and the rats were killed h after the last dose
9445,in all drug treated rats the serum triacylglycerol concentration and the hepatic microsomal activities of aminopyrine n demethylase and aniline hydroxylase were significantly increased as compared with the corresponding values in control rats
9446,the correlations between the serum triacylglycerol concentrations and the activities of the two enzymes as indices of the hepatic microsomal activity were highly significant
9447,these results indicate that the possibility of hypertriglyceridaemia as an adverse effect of the induction of the hepatic microsomal enzymes after the administration of phenylbutazone and diclofenac sodium should be considered
9448,the dissolution behaviour of a direct compression compact prepared with sodium diclofenac and dibasic calcium phosphate dcp in different weight ratios with or without biosoluble polymer acrylic based resin was investigated in distilled water and in a medium with changing ph
9449,the results indicate that the amount of sodium diclofenac released from the compact was dependent on the amount of drug and dcp used in the compact and was also controlled by the amount of biosoluble polymer added
9450,a chemical reaction forming diclofenac acid might occur on the surface of the sodium diclofenac compact during exposure to the acidic medium which was confirmed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
9451,the tablet with a weight ratio of sodium diclofenac to dcp exhibited a sustained release behaviour similar to commercial sustained release products voltaren sr and grofenac retard but a lower release rate was found as compared to the commercial products
9452,the dissolution behaviour of the study tablet and the commercial products was found to be dependent on the dissolution medium and the rotating speeds
9453,glass beads were added to the dissolution assembly to simulate the influence of food and the enhanced friction between tablet and glass beads might result in a higher dissolution rate of the tablet and the commercial products

9467,horizontal pupil diameters were obtained at the beginning of surgery after capsulotomy after intraocular lens iol implantation and at the end of surgery
9468,the mean horizontal pupil diameter was mm at the start of surgery in both groups
9469,the ketorolac group showed a consistent trend toward larger pupil diameters at subsequent surgical intervals
9470,changes from baseline also indicated more significant inhibition of miosis in the ketorolac group
9471,topical ketorolac was a more effective inhibitor of miosis than topical diclofenac during extracapsular cataract extraction and iol implantation
9472,it also provided a more stable mydriatic effect throughout surgery
9473,recently considerable interest has been focused on the use of biodegradable polymers for specialized applications such as controlled release of drug formulations meanwhile microsphere drug delivery systems using various kinds of biodegradable polymers have been studied extensively during the past two decades
9474,poly lactide co glycolide plga polymers have been proven to be excellent drug carriers for microparticulate systems due to their advantages e g

9480,diclofenac sodium enteric coated beads were prepared using the conventional pan coating technique
9481,eudragit l was used as a ph dependent release controlling polymer
9482,the beads were evaluated for their particle size distribution drug loading efficiency flowability in vitro release in n hcl ph and phosphate buffer ph and bioavailability in beagle dogs relative to the commercial enteric coated tablets voltaren
9483,the beads showed a narrow particle size distribution in which of the beads were in the range of mm
9484,the actual yield of the beads was and their drug loading was
9485,the beads released about of the drug during hr of dissolution in n hcl and the commercial tablets released no drug
9486,in phosphate buffer ph both formulations released their drug content in hr
9487,both formulations are therefore in compliance with the usp requirements for release from enteric coated dosage forms
9488,the in vivo availability study in six beagle dogs revealed that the formulated enteric coated beads filled in hard gelatin capsules had a bioavailability relative to that of the commercial voltaren tablets
9489,the tablets showed a significantly lower p area under curve for hr auc hr of micrograms hr ml compared to micrograms hr ml for the capsules
9490,the capsules showed a nonsignificantly p higher peak plasma concentration cmax of micrograms ml compared to micrograms ml for the tablets
9491,the time to reach peak tmax values were and hr for the capsules and tablets respectively

9495,diclophenac sodium was measured in the patient s plasma by using high performance liquid chromatography
9496,ortopak was shown to be eliminated from the patient s body much slower than ortophenum
9497,the bioequivalence of ortopak versus ortophenum was
9498,the pharmacokinetic properties of ortopak were similar to those of voltaren retard which were close to those of diclophenac sodium in the blood plasma within the therapeutic range
9499,aqueous solution of diclofenac sodium dcfna from commercial analgesic pill was electro oxidized on platinum and stainless steel ss anodes
9500,on platinum anode degradation of the parent drug was achieved at ph with a corresponding cod reduction of for a specific charge of coulombs l
9501,degradation and cod reduction were less at higher phs of and a number of intermediates were detected with some of them persisting at the end of the treatment
9502,on ss anode drug removal and cod decline were achieved for a specific charge of coulombs l at ph owing to combined electro oxidation and electrocoagulation
9503,contrary to platinum anode here the drug removal and cod reduction were lesser at lower phs of and electrocoagulation was found to proceed with the organics directly forming complex with iron in the matrix of the ss anode with the iron oxidizing to fe iii at ph and fe ii at phs and intermediates detected in residual liquid were much less in number and abundance
9504,in this study in vitro characterization bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of different sustained release diclofenac sodium dosage forms were compared voltaren mg tablets manufactured by ciba geigy and inflaban mg enteric coated tablets manufactured by the arab pharmaceutical manufacturing company
9505,the in vitro results demonstrated a faster rate of dissolution for inflaban as compared to voltaren but both products exhibited a sustained release pattern
9506,the bioavailability study was conducted on healthy male subjects who received a single oral dose mg of each product according to a randomized way crossover design
9507,blood samples were obtained over a hour period and drug concentrations were determined by an hplc method
9508,concentration time profiles revealed a sustained release pattern for both products
9509,the tlag for voltaren was h significantly shorter than for inflaban h indicating a faster rate of absorption from the upper gastrointestinal tract
9510,the cmax obtained with voltaren was significantly higher than that obtained with inflaban and respectively
9511,with respect to tmax and auc h parameters both products were not found to be statistically different
9512,tmax for voltaren and inflaban was and h respectively whereas auc h values for both products were and ng x h ml respectively
9513,it is believed that the observed differences between voltaren and inflaban are mainly due to the fact that inflaban is designed as an enteric coated tablet form with a core tablet having different sustained release behavior
9514,in addition the effect of food on the bioavailability of inflaban was evaluated in randomly selected male volunteers
9515,our results revealed that following light and heavy meals the auc and cmax were minimally affected by food whereas a significant increase in tmax and tlag as compared to fasting conditions was observed
9516,a single dose comparative bioavailability study and an in vitro evaluation were conducted on two sustained release formulations of diclofenac sodium voltaren v and diclogesic d
9517,the two products were found similar in weight and content uniformity
9518,the in vitro dissolution however revealed that product d has a significantly faster rate of drug release compared to product v the bioavailability study was carried out on healthy male volunteers who received a single oral dose mg tablet of each product according to a randomized crossover design
9519,blood samples were obtained over a h period and drug concentrations were determined by an hplc assay
9520,the two products were not found to be statistically different with respect to the lag time between dosing and appearance of the drug in the serum and h for v and d respectively or in the time needed to attain the peak concentrations and h for v and d respectively
9521,the two products however varied in the peak serum concentration and ng ml for v and d respectively but this difference was not statistically significance
9522,in terms of the extent of absorption assessed by estimating the area under the concentration time curve over h the two products were not significantly different and ng h ml for v and d respectively
9523,these in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that diclogesic is characterized by sustained release properties which are comparable to voltaren
9524,in order to enhance the drug entrapment efficiency and improve the swelling behaviors of drug delivery system ca crosslinking and freeze thawing ft cycle techniques were used to prepare sodium alginate poly vinyl alcohol sa pva hydrogel beads
9525,the mixture solution of sa and pva was firstly crosslinked with ca to form beads and then subjected to freezing thawing cycles for further crosslinking
9526,the crosslinking process was confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd
9527,the swelling and ph sensitive properties of the beads were investigated and the drug loading and controlled release properties of the beads were also evaluated using diclofenac sodium as the model drug
9528,results indicate that the bead was formed well and the encapsulation efficiency was greatly improved when the ratio of pva to sa is the swelling and degradation of the developed beads was influenced by ph of the test medium and pva content
9529,ft process enhanced drug entrapment efficiency improved swelling behaviors and slowed release of drug from the dual crosslinked beads compared with pure sa beads crosslinked with ca ion alone which provide a facile and effective method to improve the drug delivery system
9530,in this study utilization of artificial neural network ann models static multilayer perceptron mlp and generalized regression neural networks and dynamic gamma one layer network and recurrent one layer network for prediction of diclofenac sodium ds release from drug cationic surfactant modified zeolites physical mixtures comprising different surfactant drug molar ratio was performed
9531,the inputs for anns trainings were surfactant drug molar ratios that is drug loadings in the drug modified zeolite mixtures whereas the outputs were percents of drug release in predetermined time points during drug release test h
9532,the obtained results revealed that mlp showed the highest correlation between experimental and predicted drug release
9533,the safety of both natural and cationic surfactant modified zeolite as a potential excipient was confirmed in an acute toxicity testing during h ds mg kg p o
9534,as well as ds modified zeolites mixtures produced a significant dose dependent reduction of the rat paw edema induced by proinflammatory agent carrageenan
9535,ds antiedematous effect was intensified and prolonged significantly by modified zeolite
9536,these results could suggest the potential improvement in the treatment of inflammation by ds modified zeolite mixtures
9537,diclofenac sodium is one of the most commonly used non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
9538,it may cause alteration in the nervous system during neuronal development
9539,however there is no investigation concerning its role in the cervical spinal cord
9540,pregnant rats were divided into two groups namely drug treated and control saline injected groups
9541,to obtain the offspring of the drug treated group a dose of mg kg daily diclofenac sodium voltaren mg ml ampoule novartis was injected into the pregnant rats beginning from the th day after mating to the th day of the pregnancy
9542,to obtain the control group of offspring serum physiological at a ml kg daily dose was injected into the pregnant control rats during the same period
9543,male offspring were obtained after delivery and each group was divided into two subgroups week old and week old
9544,the total neuron number in diclofenac sodium treated rats was significantly lower than in the control group animals
9545,the total volume of the cervical spinal cord segments c c was also estimated
9546,there was a significant difference between the volumes of the two groups especially in the week old subgroup
9547,this may suggest that development of neurons and volume of cervical spinal cord are affected in prenatal animals after administration of diclofenac sodium
9548,a reproducible and fast method has been developed for the assay of acetaminophen methocarbamol and diclofenac sodium in bulk and drug forms using packed column supercritical fluid chromatography employing internal standard method
9549,the analytes were resolved by elution with supercritical fluid carbon dioxide doped with v v methanol on a shendon phenyl x mm mum column with detection monitored spectrophotometrically at nm
9550,the densities and polarities of the mobile phase were optimised from the effects of pressure temperature and modifier concentration on chromatograhic figures like retention time t r min retention factor k etc
9551,modifier concentration proved to be the most effective means for changing both retention and selectivity
9552,calibration data and recovery of the drug from spiked concentrations were determined to assess the viability of the method
9553,the supercritical fluid chromatography sfc method was directly compared to an hplc assay developed in the laboratory of the same analytes
9554,with respect to speed and use of organic solvents sfc was found to be superior while in all other aspects the results were similar to hplc
9555,the method has been successfully used for the assay of two formulations containing a combination of a acetaminophen and methocarbamol and b acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium
9556,there was no interference from excipients
9557,the present work validates the recent proposition that supercritical fluid chromatography using co and modifiers is a viable faster alternative to reverse phase hplc
9558,commercially available national thirteen brands and three international brands of diclofenac sodium sustained release matrix tablets were studied in simulated gastric medium ph for hours time period and simulated intestinal medium ph for hours time period using usp reference dissolution apparatus
9559,all the national and international brands complied with the usp in vitro dissolution specification for drug releases in simulated gastric medium
9560,however four of the national brands code ds ds ds and ds failed to fulfill their official requirement of drug release within th hour in simulated intestinal medium

9566,we aim in this study to evaluate the outcome and effectiveness of our treatment protocol using oral diclofenac sodium and topical diclofenac sodium patch in patients
9567,a retrospective database analysis of female patients between january and december was done
9568,the treatment protocol consisted of group treatment by oral diclofenac sodium mg once daily for weeks
9569,group treatment by diclofenac sodium patches for hours twice daily morning and evening for week
9570,the patients were instructed to document the time as soon as pain relief is achieved following the patch application and the intake of the oral dose
9571,the incidence rate was
9572,diclofenac sodium patch was statistically found to be significantly better in subsiding the inflammatory process of the veins relieving the pain and enhancing faster healing rate
9573,we conclude that diclofenac sodium patch showed a promising role in the treatment of mondor s disease of the breast by significantly decreasing the inflammatory process due to its transdermal migration action within a short period and the ability to reach a high local concentration
9574,it achieved the best results for rapid relief of pain and disease regression compared to the oral capsules
9575,therefore our protocol was changed to implement diclofenac sodium patch as the first choice in treating mondor s disease of the breast
9577,actinic keratoses aks a premalignant skin lesion are a common lesion in fair skin
9578,although destructive treatment remains the gold standard for aks medical therapies may be preferable due to the comfort and reliability this study aims to compare the effects of topical colchicine gel and diclofenac sodium gel in aks
9579,materials and methods
9580,in this randomized double blind study lesions were selected

9584,the mean of changes in the size was significant in both groups both before and after treatment
9585,the mean lesion size before treatment and at and days was not different between the two groups p
9586,no case of erythema was seen in the colchicine group while erythema was seen in eight cases of patients in the diclofenac sodium group p
9588,colchicine gel was a safe and effective medication with fewer side effects and lack of recurrence of the lesion
9589,the aims of this study were to prepare fine intra articular administrated chitosan thermosensitive hydrogels combined with alginate microspheres and to investigate the possibility of those hydrogels as a drug delivery system for promoting the anti inflammation effect
9590,diclofenac sodium containing alginate microspheres was prepared by a modified emulsification and or gelation method and then dispersed into injectable thermosensitive hydrogels consisting of chitosan and glycerophosphate
9591,the final combined hydrogels were evaluated in terms of their morphology properties rheological properties in vitro drug release and in vivo biocompatibility and pharmacodynamics behaviors
9592,the optimized formulation exhibited sol gel transition at c and quickly turned into gel within min with sustained drug release characteristics followed ritger peppas equation which could prolong the in vitro drug release to days
9593,in addition the anti inflammation efficacy of the combined hydrogels in rabbits with experimental rheumatoid arthritis was higher than that of drug solution and pure chitosan hydrogels
9594,those results demonstrated that these combined hydrogels could become a potential drug delivery system for improving the therapeutic effect of diclofenac sodium and suggested an important technology platform for intra articular administration
9595,to evaluate the effect of combined diclofenac sodium and nuclear rotation on the prevention of posterior capsule opacification pco
9596,wuxi people s hospital jiangsu china
9597,comparative case series
9598,in a preclinical trial porcine eyes were randomized to have hydrodissection with diclofenac sodium group a diclofenac sodium and nuclear rotation group b or a control balanced salt solution lidocaine
9599,primary cells of porcine lens epithelium from the posterior lens capsule were obtained in each group
9600,proliferation and coverage time for lens epithelial cells lecs were noted
9601,in the clinical study patients with age related cataract were divided into groups
9602,hydrodissection was performed with a balanced salt solution in group with lidocaine in group with mg ml diclofenac sodium in group and with mg ml combined diclofenac sodium and nuclear rotation in group visual acuity and corneal endothelial cell density ecd were measured
9603,in the preclinical trial n the lec coverage time in group a and group b was significantly longer than in the control group p
9604,in the clinical study n there were no significant differences between the groups in corrected distance visual acuity or corneal ecd during the year follow up p
9605,the pco scores in groups and were significantly lower than in groups and p
9606,the lowest pco score was in group
9607,hydrodissection using combined diclofenac sodium and nuclear rotation prevented pco up to years postoperatively
9608,no author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned
9609,in this investigation modified release dosage forms of diltiazem hcl dt and diclofenac sodium ds were prepared
9610,the development work comprised two main parts a loading the drug into ethylene vinyl acetate eva polymer and b generation of a non uniform concentration distribution of the drug within the polymer matrix
9611,phase separation technique was successfully used to load dt and ds into the polymer at significantly high levels up to and respectively
9612,size diameter of the resultant microspheres was between and mm
9613,controlled extraction of loaded microspheres and high vacuum freeze drying were used to generate the non uniform concentration distribution and to immobilize the new drug distribution within the matrix
9614,parameters controlling the different processes were investigated and hence optimal processing conditions were used to prepare the dosage forms
9615,rates of drug release from the two dosage forms in water and in media having different ph were found to be constant for an appreciable length of time h followed by a slow decline a characteristic of a non fickian diffusion process
9616,scanning electron microscopy studies suggested that the resultant release behavior was the outcome of the combined effects of the non uniform distribution of the drug in the matrix and the apparent changes in the pores and surface characteristics of the microspheres
9617,comparison of release rate time plots of dissolution data of marketed products with the newly developed dosage forms indicated the ability of the latter to sustain more zero order release
9618,non steroidal anti inflammatory agents nsaids such as diclofenac have very low aqueous solubilities and consequently salt formation may be used to enhance solubility and dissolution rate
9619,in this study we examined the physicochemical properties of three diclofenac salts diclofenac sodium dna diclofenac n hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine dhep and diclofenac diethylamine ddea and their different solid state forms to determine the influence of salt form on solubility dissolution rate and membrane transport
9620,the equilibrium solubility of ddea at degrees c was determined as mm lower than the solubilities of dhep mm and dna mm previously reported ledwidge and corrigan
9621,in addition to the dihydrate form of dhep previously characterised monohydrate forms of dhep and ddea were identified
9622,intrinsic dissolution rate studies were used to determine the solubility ratios of the hydrated and anhydrous forms
9623,the monohydrate form of dhep was found to be times less soluble than the anhydrate whereas ddea anhydrate was approximately times as soluble as the monohydrate form
9624,on investigation of the ph solubility profile degrees c of ddea appreciable supersaturation mm relative to the theoretical profile was detected at the ph max
9625,this contrasts with values of and mm for dhep and dna respectively
9626,the transport of salt solutions through a porous membrane visking was investigated
9627,a linear relationship between concentration mm and rate of transport mmol h was established for dna and dhep solutions
9628,the mass transfer coefficient determined for dhep was lower than that for the other two salts
9629,nevertheless the maximum transport rate obtained for dhep is almost six times higher than that obtained for ddea
9630,the influence of different cyclodextrin derivatives on the in vitro permeability of diclofenac sodium through pig cornea was investigated and compared to the commercial product voltaren ophtha
9631,hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin hp beta cd and two amorphous methylated cyclodextrins with different degrees of substitution were used
9632,in hemolysis studies on human erythrocytes the hemolytic activity of the different cyclodextrins and the drug was assessed
9633,it was shown that hp beta cd reveals the most favorable toxicological properties
9634,a decrease in the hemolytic activity of diclofenac was yielded by adding hp beta cd
9635,in the permeability experiments the dependency of the permeability coefficients and lag times on the type of cyclodextrin and ph of the solutions were examined
9636,a solution containing hp beta cd buffered in the ph range to is proposed as a useful eye drop formulation
9637,all cyclodextrin formulations showed advantages as compared to voltaren ophtha
9638,the gastrointestinal gi physiology of beagle dogs was regulated with a combined treatment of intramuscular pentagastrin micrograms kg x and intravenous atropine sulfate mg kg x
9639,here the gastric acidity the gastric emptying time and the small intestinal transit time in the regulated dogs were respectively around ph h and h approximating those in healthy humans
9640,the superiority of the regulated dogs over the intact dogs was confirmed in comparative bioavailability studies by using two classes of commercial preparations
9641,both the conventional tablet and the sustained release capsule of diclofenac sodium exhibited simple and similar average plasma concentration time curves of free diclofenac in the intact dogs while the latter preparation is reported to reveal a bimodal plasma curve of the drug in healthy humans
9642,the regulated dogs however permitted a bimodal average plasma pattern of the drug for the capsules due to an approximation of the gi physiology between humans and these classes of the dogs
9643,the combined treatment of beagle dogs with pentagastrin and atropine sulfate seems to supply a useful animal model in predicting the absorption characteristics of the sustained release preparations and poor water soluble drugs
9644,diclofenac active ingredient of voltaren has a significant multifaceted role in medicine pharmacy and biochemistry
9645,its physical properties and impact on biomolecular structures still attract essential scientific interest

9670,the objectives of our study were to evaluate the ability of pluronic l surfactant to give niosomal systems alone or after its functionalization with acrylic groups
9671,the achieved formulations were tested for the percutaneous permeation of sodium diclofenac as model drug
9672,in vitro experiments were conducted by franz diffusion cells using rabbit ear skin
9673,data recorded over h were compared with those obtained from the drug solution as control
9674,in addition the stability of niosomes was improved polymerizing the acryloyl groups of the monomers because as reported in the literature polymerized vesicles maintain their shape for long periods of time and show remarkable increase in drug encapsulation efficiency
9675,mean vesicles diameter drug entrapment efficiency percutaneous permeation and release profiles were investigated for all vesicles with different composition
9676,the results indicated an increase in mean vesicles diameter and entrapment efficiency with the increase of polymerizable moieties amount
9677,these properties were found to be more evident when the vesicles were polymerized
9678,in addition cytotoxic effects were estimated
9679,the results of this study showed that niosomes based on commercial functionalized or a mixture of both pluronic l surfactants can be used to achieve retarded release and to enhance the permeation of sodium diclofenac without incurring unacceptable toxicity
9680,the aim of this study was to develop and characterize diclofenac sodium loaded cellulose acetate butyrate microparticles in order to obtain a controlled release system
9681,the influence of the type of polymer the volume and composition of the internal phase drug loading surfactant concentration and additive added on microparticles characteristics particle size encapsulation efficiency surface morphology and in vitro release profiles was studied to optimize the microparticles system
9682,the resultant microparticles were evaluated for the recovery average particle size drug loading and incorporation efficiency
9683,the microparticles exhibited good flowing nature and compressibility index when compared to pure drug
9684,dissolution rate of diclofenac sodium in phosphate buffer ph increased with increases in initial drug loading surfactant concentration and addition of alcohol as co solvent but decreased with increases in the concentration of additives such as gantrez an or eudragit s in the internal phase
9685,the dissolution data showed a higuchi diffusion pattern for most of the formulations
9686,about reduction in ulcerogenic activity was observed with microparticles containing eudragit s based on total polymer concentration when compared with pure diclofenac sodium
9687,high inter and intra individual variability in the ph of fluids in the human gastrointestinal gi tract has been described in the literature
9688,the aim of this study was to assess the influence of physiological variability in fasted ph profiles of media along the gi tract on diclofenac sodium df na dissolution from matrix tablets
9689,four individual in vivo fasted ph profiles were selected from the literature that differed in ph values and transit times from the stomach to the proximal colon
9690,using a glass bead device flow through dissolution system these ph profiles were simulated in vitro using a specific media sequence and considering simulated intestinal buffer capacities corresponding to in vivo literature data
9691,dissolution experiments were then performed in the same system with media sequence following individual ph profiles
9692,in dissolution experiments where influences of simulated gastric emptying time get gastric ph value small intestinal transit time and colonic ph were studied high influence of gastric ph value and get on df na dissolution was observed
9693,the effect of variability in ph profiles in the range of individual in vivo data on df na dissolution was also clearly observed in experiments where dissolution studies were performed following three simulated in vivo individual ph profiles
9694,the differences in df na release between three individual ph profiles were substantial they also reflected in simulated plasma concentration profiles and can be attributed to ph dependent diclofenac solubility
9695,the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of diclofenac sodium ds on the total number of neurons in segment t of the spinal cord of offspring of pregnant rats using stereological methods
9696,eighteen adult female wistar albino rats weighing g were used
9697,pregnant female rats were divided into three groups a control group a sham group and a ds mg kg intramuscular exposed group
9698,the ds and sham groups received injection from the th day of gestation to the th
9699,twenty eight days after birth the offspring rats were perfused with buffered formalin
9700,t which is one of transverse spinal cord segments were isolated and processed for routine paraffin histology
9701,m sections were obtained using a rotary microtome according to systematic random sampling strategies
9702,every th section was taken and sections were stained with modified giemsa
9703,all types of motor neuron cell were identified according to their morphology
9704,in this study the disector cavalieri combination method was used in the stereological examination of neurons
9705,the motor neurons were counted in the right gray matter of the ventral horn in the spinal cord segment
9706,the kruskal wallis test was used for comparison the groups
9707,in terms of motoneuron number no significant difference among the groups was found p
9708,in conclusion our results indicated that prenatal exposure to ds has no effect on the total number of motor neuron of the offspring rats
9709,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are widely used for the purpose of anti inflammation antipyretic and analgesia
9710,for this aim they are used for the alleviation of pain fever and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis sports injuries and temporary pain
9711,however treatment with nsaids may be accompanied by adverse effects such as gastrointestinal damage and platelet dysfunction
9712,as with the other nsaids diclofenac sodium sodium o dichlorophenyl amino phenyl acetate ds an nsaid has potent anti inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic effects
9713,however treatment with ds may cause some adverse cerebral and cerebellar effects such as convulsions disorientation hallucination and loss of consciousness
9714,melatonin mlt is a free radical scavenger and possesses antioxidant properties
9715,it has been reported to easily cross the blood brain barrier and is found in high concentrations in the brain after exogenous administration
9716,it is also a neuroprotector in a wide range of conditions affecting the central nervous system cns due to its free radical scavenging activities and lipophilic hydrophilic properties
9717,neuroprotective actions of mlt have been discovered in both in vitro and in vivo and are a powerful scavenger of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals
9718,thus mlt can protect the cell membrane organelles and core against free radical damage
9719,therefore it has been postulated that exogenous mlt acts as a neuroprotector contrary to ds neurotoxicity
9720,in this review we aimed to discuss the possible neuroprotective effects of mlt on ds toxicity
9721,to evaluate the opioid sparing and analgesic effect of diclofenac sodium in ambulatory nonimmersion extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy eswl

9725,eswl was performed with a sedative analgesic technique
9726,diclofenac sodium mg or an equal volume of saline was given intramuscularly minutes prior to the procedure
9727,fentanyl and midazolam were added to maintain adequate sedation and analgesia
9728,demographically both groups were comparable
9729,in the diclofenac sodium group heart rate was slightly higher treatment time was shorter more shock waves were administered p and less fentanyl was required p
9730,mean arterial pressure was lower and arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter was higher in the diclofenac sodium group
9731,there were no differences between the groups in voltage stone size fragmentation dose of midazolam administered or overall assessment by both the doctors and patients
9732,patients administered diclofenac sodium received a greater number of shock waves required less fentanyl and showed a marginal improvement in hemodynamic stability and oxygenation during ambulatory nonimmersion eswl
9733,the influence of diclofenac sodium voltaren on glucose metabolism was investigated in a group of maturity onset diabetics treated by a standard diet alone
9734,a second group of patients with maturity onset diabetes well controlled by a standard diet and tolbutamide rastinon was examined for a possible drug interaction
9735,determinations of capillary blood glucose as well as assessments of urine sugar by clinitest and hour urine glucose determinations were regularly done before and during treatment with diclofenac sodium
9736,the results of this study show no alteration of glucose metabolism
9737,these laboratory data suggest that there is no clinically relevant interaction between diclofenac sodium and tolbutamide
9738,neither the blood glucose profiles of the individual patients nor those of the two above mentioned groups showed any alterations of blood glucose concentration
9739,diclofenac sodium a non steroidal antirheumatic drug may be recommended in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in diabetics
9740,indomethacin naproxen sulindac diftalon and diclofenac are more recently developed antirheumatic drugs which have been specially tested in diabetics
9741,a double blind crossover trial between diclofenac sodium and placebo was carried out in hospitalized patients who were thought to be stabilized on concurrent anticoagulant therapy with acenocoumarol
9742,the object of the trial was to investigate any possible interaction between diclofenac and anticoagulant by monitoring prothrombin times daily through the four week period
9743,no statistically significant difference between placebo and diclofenac could be shown and some problems of accurately monitoring prothrombin times are discussed
9744,this corrects the article doi
9746,renal physiology is a partially cyclooxygenase cox dependent system
9747,kidneys express both cox and cox enzymes
9748,in this study we tried to investigate the effects of diclofenac sodium d with or without furosemide f on plasma renin activity pra serum and urine electrolytes creatinine clearance and cox and cox expression in the renal cortex
9749,forty two wistar albino rats were divided into four groups g
9750,g g g and g were treated with placebo f mg kg f mg kg plus d mg kg and d mg kg respectively and followed for seven days
9751,urinary osmolality and volume and levels of serum and urinary creatinine sodium and potassium were measured
9752,renal cox and cox expression were examined by the immunohistochemical method
9753,compared with g body weights were significantly reduced in g and g p for all
9754,serum sodium in g decreased significantly compared with g g and g
9755,serum potassium in g decreased significantly compared with g and g
9756,urine volume in g increased significantly compared with g g and g
9757,urine osmolality in g and g decreased significantly compared with g and g
9758,urine na in g increased significantly compared with g
9759,although urine k was lowest in g there were no statistically significant differences between the groups
9760,creatinine clearance decreased in g compared with the other groups
9761,pra was similar in all groups
9762,renal cortical cox expression was lowest in g
9763,cox expression in cortical collecting tubules was significantly reduced in g and g compared with g and g p for all
9764,although creatinine clearance in g was significantly lower than in g cox and cox expression were no different in g and g
9765,acute renal failure was caused by d f prevented development of renal failure in rats treated with a combination of d and f the diuretic effect of f was neutralized by d whereas cox expression was reduced by d and by the combination of d and f in g and g renal cox immunoreactivity was increased by f and d and the combination of both
9766,although creatinine clearance was lower in rats that were given d alone compared with the combination of f and d cox and cox expression were similar in these groups
9767,topical diclofenac and imiquimod have been reported to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratosis but a study to compare these two drugs has not been reported yet
9768,to compare the efficacy and safety of topical diclofenac gel plus hyaluronic acid and imiquimod cream in the treatment of actinic keratosis
9769,forty nine patients with actinic keratosis were enrolled in this randomized comparative open label study
9770,twenty four patients applied diclofenac gel once a daily to their lesions while the other patients were treated with a imiquimod cream three times a week for weeks
9771,patients were examined before treatment and every month of the treatment
9772,assessments were made by investigators according to the investigator and the patient global improvement indices igii and pgii
9773,according to the igii results a complete response was observed in of the diclofenac group and of the imiquimod group
9774,for the pgii scores a complete response was observed in of the diclofenac group and of the imiquimod group
9775,there were no significant differences between the two groups p
9776,both treatments were well tolerated with most adverse events related to skin
9777,the two drugs were found to be equally effective and safe in the treatment of actinic keratosis but complete remission was very low
9778,therefore topical treatments with these two drugs were not seen to be completely effective and combined therapies and further studies are needed
9779,the effects of diclofenac sodium and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta on electrical parameters of rat jejunal membrane were investigated together with measurement of the mucosal to serosal flux of sulphanilic acid or l phenylalanine
9780,both adjuvants increased the flux rate of sulphanilic acid to a similar extent when added to the mucosal solution at mm but there were apparent differences in their effects on the electrical parameters
9781,the addition of edta induced the gradual reduction in the membrane resistance rm by ohm cm while the effect of diclofenac on rm was complicated and concentration dependent
9782,the short circuit current isc was reduced rapidly to the level of microa cm by the addition of diclofenac but was less affected by edta
9783,the flux rate of l phenylalanine was decreased extensively by diclofenac or the mm concentration of edta suggesting an inhibition of carrier mediated transport systems in the membrane
9784,together with our preceding communication yamashita et al j pharm
9786,it became obvious that the sites of action of diclofenac and edta were different the former directly interacting with the epithelial cell to alter the permeability and functions of the cell membrane while the primary effect of edta could be at the intercellular junctions
9787,the in vitro percutaneous transport of sodium diclofenac from various oil vehicles was examined using rat abdominal skin as a model skin membrane
9788,the overall transport of diclofenac through the skin from the oleaginous vehicles was very poor because of a poor solubility of sodium diclofenac in nonpolar oils
9789,to increase the solubility and the permeability of sodium diclofenac ethanol and n octanol were added to each oil designated as the formulated vehicles
9790,the addition of ethanol and n octanol to the nonpolar vehicles resulted in an extreme increase in drug solubility in each vehicle with a remarkable increase in the permeation of diclofenac
9791,the effects of oil components in the formulated vehicle on the permeation of diclofenac across the skin were in the following order squalane greater than or equal to squalene greater than liquid paraffin greater than middle chain triglyceride greater than olive oil greater than castor oil
9792,in order to clarify the reason for the differences in permeation of diclofenac from these formulated vehicles the release of diclofenac and n octanol from these vehicles in vitro was studied
9793,the release rates of n octanol from the formulated vehicles were in the following order liquid paraffin greater than squalene greater than or equal to squalane greater than middle chain triglyceride greater than or equal to olive oil greater than castor oil
9794,on the other hand a linear correlation was observed between the initial release rate of diclofenac from the formulated vehicle and the in vitro permeation of diclofenac through the vehicle to the skin
9795,abstract truncated at words
9796,in a randomized parallel group single center study in healthy adults the safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of an intravenous formulation of and mg diclofenac sodium dfp following single and multiple dose bolus administration were compared with diclofenac potassium mg oral tablets
9797,mean auc inf values for a mg oral tablet and an mg intravenous formulation were similar vs
9798,as measured by the auc dfp mg and mg demonstrated dose proportionality for extent of exposure
9799,one subject in each of the placebo and dfp mg groups and subjects in the dfp mg group reported adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug
9800,all were mild in intensity and did not require treatment
9801,two subjects in the placebo group and subject in the dfp mg group reported grade thrombophlebitis no subjects reported higher than grade thrombophlebitis after receiving a single intravenous dose
9802,the and mg doses of intravenous diclofenac single and multiple were well tolerated for days
9803,additional efficacy and safety studies are required to fully characterize the product
9804,with respect to diclofenac sodium containing tape preparations of nonsteroidal antiphlogistic drug we compared the pharmaceutical properties ph elongatedness water vapor permeability adhesive force and peeling force of medicinal drugs brand name and generic drugs to obtain evidence for product selection in line with the needs of the patient
9805,the elongatedness of the generic drugs teikoku yutoku and nippon zoki were significantly higher than the brand name drug voltaren
9806,to evaluate whether the concomitant consumption of cod liver oil can reduce the daily dose of diclofenac sodium and probably the risk of the side effects which are associated with it in rheumatoid arthritis patients
9807,this longitudinal prospective open label study was conducted from april to september at mahatma gandhi medical college and hospital jaipur india
9808,rheumatoid arthritis patients who were aged between to years who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled
9809,each patient was given five cod liver oil capsules twice a day for a period of weeks
9810,each capsule which contained mg of cod liver oil had eicosapentaenoic acid mg and docosahexaenoic acid mg the patients who took different nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs daily were switched over to diclofenac sodium mg as a single dose up to a maximum dose of mg per day
9811,the dose of diclofenac sodium which was consumed per day and the average daily requirement at different visits were recorded in each patient and they were compared
9812,the patients were assessed for their pain scores by using the visual analogue scale vas at different weeks
9813,in addition the subjective response to the pain was evaluated in each patient at the respective visits
9814,the student s t test was applied for the analysis of the vas pain score and for the evaluation of the reduction in the mean daily dose of the diclofenac sodium consumption
9815,a probability value of less than p was considered to be statistically significant
9816,moreover the results of the subjective response to the pain were expressed as percentage
9817,a significant decrease p in the mean vas pain score from at week to at week was noted in the patients
9818,there was a significant reduction p in mean dose of diclofenac sodium consumed from at week to at week moreover the percentage of the patients who experienced a better subjective response increased from at week to at week of the treatment follow up
9819,this study revealed that the concurrent use of cod liver oil which contained n essential fatty acid in rheumatoid arthritis patients reduced the mean daily dose of diclofenac sodium consumed and probably the incidence of the side effects which were associated with it
9820,the present study was designed as an open label multiple dose randomized parallel trial to evaluate the pharmacodynamic drug drug interaction of lisinopril and concomitantly administered diclofenac sodium in non diabetic and diabetic mild to moderate hypertensive osteoarthritic patients
9821,post screening and on inclusion patients were put on a week washout period and then randomly assigned to either only lisinopril mg or combination of lisinopril mg and diclofenac sodium mg treatments for weeks in diseased states of hypertension and osteoarthritis with or without type diabetes mellitus
9822,the blood pressure bp control with lisinopril was reduced by concomitantly administered diclofenac sodium in non diabetic sbp p dbp p and diabetic sbp p dbp p patients when compared with the patients receiving lisinopril alone
9823,insulin sensitivity was improved p and urinary albumin excretion rate was better controlled p in lisinopril treated patients when compared with the combination treatment in diabetic pool
9824,serum creatinine levels increased significantly in non diabetic patients p receiving combination treatment
9825,in addition creatinine clearance clcr and blood urea nitrogen bun were significantly higher in diabetic clcr p bun p as well as in non diabetic clcr p bun p patients treated with combination treatment
9826,the alterations in serum electrolytes reduction in platelet aggregation activity and improvement in lipid profile was more profound with combination treatment in comparison to lisinopril alone
9827,the antihypertensive efficacy and insulin sensitivity improving property of lisinopril along with the renal function might get worse in hypertensive osteoarthritic patients receiving concomitant treatment of oral diclofenac sodium with lisinopril
9828,in addition to this close monitoring of serum electrolytes is also suggested to rule out any long term detrimental effect
9829,the cardiotoxic effects of selective cyclo oxygenase inhibitors are well documented
9830,recently concerns have been raised over the cardiovascular safety of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
9831,the aim of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of diclofenac sodium on doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy in rats
9832,male wistar rats were treated with doxorubicin mg kg intraperitoneally single dose diclofenac sodium and mg kg day respectively by gavage for days alone and doxorubicin diclofenac sodium treatment hours after doxorubicin administration
9833,doxorubicin induced a significant p increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and catalase levels and a significant p decrease in the cardiac glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels which were significantly p aggravated by diclofenac sodium treatment
9834,diclofenac sodium alone also showed a significant change in these parameters compared with the control
9835,ultrastructural studies showed that doxorubicin causes apoptosis in myocardium which was characterized by condensation of chromatin network at the margins of nuclear membrane
9836,apoptosis induced by doxorubicin was exacerbated by diclofenac sodium treatment
9837,thus our study indicates that diclofenac sodium a nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug is not free from cardiotoxicity and aggravates doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy in rats
9838,arachidonic acid metabolites appear to participate in skin penetration by and transformation of schistosome cercariae and in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis
9839,with this in mind mice were treated with one of two cyclooxygenase inhibitors before and or after infection with schistosoma mansoni
9840,the effects of the treatment on liver morbidity and the parasitic infection were then evaluated using infected untreated and uninfected treated mice as controls
9841,treatment with ibuprofen mg kg day or diclofenac sodium mg kg day for days before infection led to significantly lower liver weights worm loads and hepatic hydroxyproline contents than in the untreated mice
9842,if treatment with either drug was continued after infection for days there was an additional significant decrease in hepatic gamma glutamyl transpeptidase activity
9843,all these parameters except liver weight were similarly affected when treatment with either drug was begun on the day of infection and continued for days
9844,there was no significant change in liver weight or worm load when treatment was delayed until day post infection but faecal egg counts were reduced in the treated groups
9845,in additional experiments using a smaller dose of diclofenac sodium mg kg day all the measured parameters of infection were significantly decreased when the treatment was initiated days before infection and continued until day post infection
9846,the results indicate that the treatment of s mansoni infected mice with ibuprofen or diclofenac sodium was effective in reducing the severity of infection and in attenuating hepatic fibrosis particularly when the treatment was started early in relation to the time of infection
9847,the c aminopyrine breath test is a simple procedure for the non invasive determination of the microsomal function of the liver
9848,after the oral administration of a tracer dose of microci kbq of c aminopyrine the co activity of the expired breath air is determined in hourly intervals
9849,there is a close correlation between its decrease and the elimination of aminopyrine from the plasma
9850,both the elimination constant of co kbreath and the maximal specific co activity are useful quantitative parameters of the test
9851,they allow conclusions as to the hepatic demethylation capacity
9852,both parameters were significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in control patients
9853,the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenacsodium voltaren did not significantly influence the demethylation of c aminopyrine in patients with rheumatic diseases and in healthy probands
9854,further experiences with the breath test are necessary especially with respect to its suitability for prospective investigations
9855,actinic keratosis area and severity index akasi is a new assessment tool to quantify the severity of actinic damage on the head
9856,thus far it has not been evaluated in monitoring the efficacy of field directed topical treatments in actinic keratosis ak in routine clinical practice
9857,thus the aim of this study was to determine treatment outcomes by using akasi months after the initiation of topical application of diclofenac sodium in hyaluronic acid gel dfs in patients with aks on the head
9858,we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with aks who had akasi scores prior to and after treatment with dfs
9859,of the patients included showed an improvement in akasi a stable akasi and a worsening of akasi after a median interquartile range follow up period of days
9860,the median akasi reduction was
9861,the wilcoxon test showed significant differences p between baseline and posttreatment akasi values
9862,akasi is an easy to use quantitative tool for assessing the treatment outcome of field directed therapies
9863,field directed therapies of ak should no longer be monitored by assessments based on lesion counts alone
9865,the effect of second third and fifth generations of poly propylene imine glycodendrimers open maltose shell ppi mal on reverse hexagonal hii mesophase and on the release of sodium diclofenac na dfc drug was investigated
9866,the hii mesophase comprised glycerol monooleate gmo tricaprylin tag in a weight ratio of and wt water wt ppi mal of each generation without or with wt na dfc
9867,the microstructural characteristics of these systems were determined by small angle x ray scattering attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared was used to characterize the molecular level interactions and the location of the ppi mal
9868,third and fifth generation ppi mal because of their maltose groups interact mainly with the bulk water within the cylinders of the hii and strongly bind the water molecules as manifested by the decrease in the lattice parameter and dehydration of the lipid headgroups
9869,co solubilization of na dfc with the third and fifth generations caused competition of the two host compounds for water binding and induced relocation of the drug from the bulk water to the gmo water interface
9870,in vitro release of na dfc from the hii showed that the release process was faster in the systems with third and fifth generation ppi mal compared with the control and second generation systems
9871,to successfully prepare the diclofenac sodium ds loaded solid lipid nanoparticles slns phospholipid complexes pcs technology was applied here to improve the liposolubility of ds

9873,ds could be solubilized effectively in the organic solvents with the existence of phospholipid and apparent partition coefficient of ds in pcs increased significantly
9874,x ray diffraction analysis suggested that ds in pcs was either molecularly dispersed or in an amorphous form
9875,however no significant difference was observed between the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of physical mixture and that of pcs
9876,particles with small sizes narrow polydispersity indexes and high entrapment efficiencies could be obtained with the addition of pcs
9877,furthermore according to the transmission electron microscopy a core shell structure was likely to be formed
9878,the presence of pcs caused the change of zeta potential and retarded the drug release of slns which indicated that phospholipid formed multilayers around the solid lipid core of slns
9879,both ft ir and differential scanning calorimetry analysis also illustrated that some weak interactions between ds and lipid materials might take place during the preparation of slns
9880,in conclusion the model hydrophilic drug ds can be formulated into the slns with the help of pcs

9940,various pharmacokinetic parameters ie c max t max area under the curve auc and mean residence time and relative bioavailability were compared
9941,all fabricated formulations showed more prolonged and controlled ds release compared with commercial tablets studied
9942,the om and op tablets however performed better than the matrix tablets
9943,the rate and extent of drug release from fm matrix tablets single polymer was significantly different from that of fm admixed polymers
9944,type of porosigenic agents and osmogens also influenced the drug release
9945,analysis of in vitro data by regression coefficient analysis revealed zero order release kinetics for om and op tablets while fm tablets exhibited higuchi kinetics
9946,in vivo results indicated prolonged blood levels with delayed peak and improved bioavailability for fabricated tablets compared to commercial tablets
9947,it was concluded that the osmotic matrix and osmotic pump tablets could provide more prolonged controlled and gastrointestinal environmental independent ds release that may result in an improved therapeutic efficacy and patient compliance
9948,one hundred forty eight patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic in reducing ocular inflammation following extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
9949,eligible patients were enrolled and randomized diclofenac placebo if the sum of anterior chamber cells plus flare one day postoperatively baseline was at least four
9950,none of the patients received concomitant steroidal anti inflammatory treatment
9951,the patients receiving diclofenac sodium had significantly greater improvement from baseline in summed flare plus cell score than the placebo patients at two to five days and seven to nine days after baseline
9952,similarly diclofenac sodium patients had significantly less post baseline conjunctival erythema and ciliary flush than placebo patients

9956,there were no clinically important differences in mean intraocular pressure at any visit
9957,the influence of different n octenylsuccinate starch as formulations i e
9958,as solutions and an as stabilized emulsion system on the in vitro corneal permeation behaviour of sodium diclofenac dfna was investigated and compared to the commercial product voltaren ophtha vo
9959,although saturation concentrations of dfna achieved with polyoxethylene castor oil poc which is the solubilizing additive in vo are higher than those achieved with as at varying ph values it was found that as solutions yield higher dfna permeation rates than vo or a poc solution
9960,however permeation is extremely reduced with rising as concentrations or as emulsions
9961,neither ph value or nor presence of preservative seem to have an impact on permeation activity
9962,in order to assess possible cytotoxic effects of the preparations investigated red blood cell haemolysis studies were performed with different preparations containing dfna
9963,none of the tested as formulations showed significantly high haemolytic data
9964,on the other hand the high in vitro haemolysis obtained with vo is primarily based on an osmotic effect caused by boric acid
9965,the mechanism of l menthol oleic acid and lauricidin as enhancers on percutaneous absorption was examined using diclofenac dh as a hydrophobic drug and sodium diclofenac dna as a hydrophilic drug in in vitro diffusion experiments with two kinds of membranes ethanol treated and untreated silicone membranes these were models for the lipid and pore pathways of skin
9966,a w w ethanol aqueous solution decreased the flux of dh but increased the flux of dna significantly across the treated membrane compared with those fluxes across the untreated membrane suggesting that dh penetrated by the lipid pathway and dna by the pore pathway
9967,the permeability of dna through the pore pathway decreased significantly across the treated membrane with the addition of oleic acid and lauricidin
9968,l menthol increased the permeability coefficients of dh and dna more in a treated membrane than in an untreated one showing the same tendency as in rat skin
9969,thus while oleic acid and lauricidin did not increase the permeation of dna by the pore pathway l menthol appeared to enhance the permeation of the drug by both the lipid and pore pathways
9970,the effects of various i v
9971,doses of diclofenac sodium voltaren and mg kg were evaluated by measuring the vocalization threshold in response to paw pressure in normal and in freund s adjuvant induced arthritic rats
9972,an electrophysiological study performed in parallel in arthritic rats considered the effects of mg kg i v
9973,diclofenac on ventrobasal thalamic neuronal responses driven by mild stimulation of an inflamed joint

9975,diclofenac raised vocalization thresholds significantly maximum vocalization thresholds were respectively and of the preinjection control at min n in each group while no effect was observed with mg kg
9976,in arthritic rats i v
9977,doses of and mg kg diclofenac induced a clear analgesic effect maximum vocalization thresholds were respectively of the control at min n in each group whereas a dose of mg kg i v
9978,did not raise the threshold
9979,in arthritic rats the vb neuronal responses were depressed by about min after an injection of mg kg i v
9981,these results clearly establish that diclofenac produces a dose dependent analgesic effect which is more potent in arthritic than in normal rats
9982,high frequency pulse iontophoresis of diclofenac sodium across excised guinea pig skin was carried out in vitro
9983,an equivalent circuit model was constructed to simulate the time courses of voltage drop across the donor solution and the skin

10002,mean iief scores month after biopsy were significantly lower when compared with the mean iief scores months after biopsy p
10003,trus guided prostate biopsies have a statistically significant impact on short term erectile function but this difference is not clinically significant however medium term erectile function is not affected both statistically and clinically
10004,two sustained release formulations microspheres and voltaren sr were evaluated for their drug release characteristics in dissolution in vitro study and after oral administration to beagle dogs in vivo study by hplc
10005,the dissolution study was carried out according to the paddle method and the pharmacokinetic study was conducted using hplc analysis in a crossover design in six female beagle dogs after oral administration of mg diclofenac sodium dfs
10006,the dissolution profiles showed release for voltaren sr and around for the microspheres
10007,oral administration of dfs resulted in auc and cmax values of microg h ml and microg ml for microspheres and microg h ml and microg ml for voltaren respectively
10008,the tmax was h for both formulations
10009,a significant difference in auc and cmax was observed for dfs absorption from microspheres and voltaren
10010,the results from the dissolution assay demonstrated the faster release of diclofenac sodium from microspheres
10011,the bioavailability of dfs in microspheres was about that of voltaren for the parameters auc and cmax and they are therefore not bioequivalent to voltaren in relation to the extent of absorption
10012,however the rate of drug absorption tmax was similar for the two formulations
10013,this study describes a novel simple rapid and sensitive colorimetric assay method for diclofenac sodium tablets
10014,the method is based on a simple aromatic ring derivatization technique using newly developed carboxyl dinitrobenzenediazonium ion cdnbd as chromogenic derivatizing reagent with subsequent formation of an azo dye
10015,the diazo coupling reaction was carried out between cdnbd and diclofenac
10016,optimization studies for time and temperature was conducted using the method of steepest ascent
10017,the uv absorption spectrum was recorded and the stoichiometric ratio for the drug and reagent was done by continuous variation method
10018,optimal calibration range was fixed way anova and then the method was applied to dosage form analysis
10019,comparison of dosage form analysis was done with the bp hplc method
10020,the diazo coupling reaction is very fast and optimization studies established an optimal reaction immediately after mixing the reaction mixture in a vortex mixer for sec
10021,a new absorption maximum lambdamax at nm was selected as analytical wavelength
10022,the assays were linear over microg ml of diclofenac and the reaction required a reagent drug stoichiometric ratio
10023,the new method has a low limit of detection of microg ml and was reproducible over a three day assessment of precision rsd
10024,the method has been successfully applied to the assay of diclofenac sodium slow release tablets and found to be of equivalent accuracy p with the official b p hplc method
10025,the new method has distinct advantages of speed simplicity sensitivity and more affordable instrumentation and could find application as a rapid analytical method for diclofenac sodium tablets
10026,quantitative determinations of unchanged diclofenac and two of its major phenolic metabolites were made by reverse isotope dilution analysis on urine of rat dog rhesus monkey baboon and man and on bile of rat dog and man
10027,isotope dilution analysis was performed before and after various methods of enzymic and chemical hydrolysis
10028,the same samples were also analysed by two dimensional t l c
10029,and subsequent autoradiography to estimate the remaining phenolic metabolites
10030,in contrast to rat rhesus monkey baboon and man which excrete mainly hydroxylated metabolites the dog does not oxidize diclofenac
10031,dog urine contained a relatively stable taurine conjugate of diclofenac and in the bile an ester glucuronide was excreted which decomposed even in weakly alkaline soln
10032,the unstable ester glucuronide found in dog bile was also demonstrable in rat bile
10033,it presumably hydrolyses in the duodenum releasing diclofenac which undergoes enterohepatic circulation
10034,eudragit l nanofibers loaded with diclofenac sodium ds were successfully prepared using an electrospinning process and characterized for structural and pharmacodynamic properties
10035,the influence of solvent and drug content on fiber formation and quality was also investigated
10036,fiber formation was successful using a solvent mixture v v ethanol dmac
10037,xrd and dsc analysis of fibers confirm electron microscopic evidence that ds is evenly distributed in the nanofibers in an amorphous state
10038,ftir analysis indicates hydrogen bonding occurs between the drug and the polymer which accounts for the molecular integration of the two components
10039,in vitro dissolution tests verified that all the drug loaded eudragit l nanofibers had ph dependent drug release profiles with limited less than release at ph but a sustained and complete release at ph this profile of properties indicates drug loaded eudragit l nanofibers have the potential to be developed as oral colon targeted drug delivery systems
10040,the purpose of the study was to screen the effects of formulation factors on the in vitro release profile of diclofenac sodium from matrix tablets using design of experiment doe
10041,formulations of diclofenac sodium tablets with carbopol g as matrix substance were optimized by artificial neural network
10042,according to central composite design formulations of diclofenac sodium matrix tablets were prepared
10043,as network inputs concentration of carbopol g and the kollidon k were selected
10044,in vitro dissolution time profiles at different sampling times were chosen as responses
10045,the independent variables and the release parameters were processed by multilayer perceptrons neural network mlp
10046,results of drug release studies indicate that drug release rates vary between different formulations with a range of h to more than h to complete dissolution
10047,for two tested formulations there was no difference between experimental and mlp predicted in vitro profiles
10048,the mlp model was optimized
10049,the root mean square value for the trained network was which indicated that the optimal mlp model was reached
10050,the optimal tablet formulation predicted by mlp was with of carbopol g and of kollidon k
10051,calculated difference factor f and similarity factor f indicate that there is no difference between predicted and experimentally observed drug release profiles for the optimal formulation
10052,the satisfactory prediction of drug release for optimal formulation by the mlp in this study has shown the applicability of this optimization method in modeling extended release tablet formulation
10053,chitosan hydrogel beads containing diclofanac sodium were prepared using ionotropic gelation technique in which tripolyphosphate solution was used as a counterion
10054,chitosan molecular weight tripolyphosphate concentration and crosslinking time were found to have an effect on the percentage of the drug loading
10055,the loading efficiency of diclofenac sodium was very high more than
10056,a longer period of contact with the counterion ions decreased the efficiency of drug loading
10057,the beads produced all had good spherical geometry
10058,the beads showed a narrow size distribution in which of the beads prepared were in the range of mm
10059,comparison of release rate time plots of dissolution data of marketed product with the newly developed dosage form indicated the ability of the later to sustain more diclofenac sodium release
10060,the beads were evaluated for their bioavailability in six beagle dogs relative to the commercial enteric coated voltaren tablets
10061,the in vivo availability study reveled that the prepared beads filled in hard gelatin capsules had a bioavailability relative to that of the commercial voltaren tablets
10062,the beads showed comparable pharmacokinetic parameters to that of the commercial tablets
10063,the results suggested the possibility of producing a promising sustained drug delivery system for diclofenac sodium
10064,controlled release matrix tablets for diclofenac sodium were developed in this study
10065,five matrix tablet formulations were prepared by granulating two viscosity grades of hpmc hydroxylpropylmethylcellulose in varying ratios with water in the planetary mixer
10066,the in vitro dissolution tests indicate that all five matrix formulations prolong the release of diclofenac sodium
10067,the main factors controlling drug release were the hpmc viscosity grade and the amount of hpmc used
10068,the larger the amount of high viscosity grade hpmc used the slower the resultant release rate of diclofenac sodium
10069,there was no significant degradation of diclofenac sodium or change in drug release rate in any of the five formulations during a three month period of stability testing
10070,the sustained release ability of four formulations was further demonstrated in an in vivo study in six healthy subjects
10071,there were in vitro in vivo correlations between cmax auc and the time for or drug to be released
10072,there is a continuous search for a better therapy in osteoarthritis oa management

10074,the rats that were used in this study were divided into groups n rats viz normal control oa control oa n oa low dose of sct sct lw oa high dose of sct sct hi oa n sct lw oa n sct hi and oa df
10075,oa was induced with mg of sodium monoiodoacetate in l of saline
10076,the solution was injected into the left knee joint space of anaesthetised rats
10077,sct was administered at and iu kg b w
10078,im whereas n and df were administered at and mg kg b w
10081,treatments commenced days after the induction of oa and they lasted for days
10082,sct and or n significantly reduced c telopeptide of type collagen ctx collagen type cm malondialdehyde mda uric acid ua and interleukin il but significantly increased superoxide dismutase sod after oa induction
10083,both therapies had additive effects on cm mda sod and catalase cat but non additive actions on ua il and ctx
10084,like the sct and n df significantly reduced ctx cm ua and il
10085,however it had no significant effect on sod and mda even though it significantly reduced cat activity
10086,none of the therapies had significant effect on total alkaline phosphatase activity except n sct lw
10087,the combined and sometimes the single administration of sct and n proved to be better therapies in oa management than df
10088,peritoneal adhesions are seen frequently after abdominal surgery and can cause serious complications
10089,we aimed to evaluate the effects of the oral use of diclofenac sodium and ellagic acid on formation of postoperative adhesions in rats studies have shown that agents with anti inflammatory properties and antioxidant substances can prevent adhesion by decreasing oxidative stress
10090,we compared and evaluated the effects of ellagic acid that has strong antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties and the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory diclofenac sodium on peritoneal adhesion development in our experimental study
10091,laparotomy was performed with a midline incision under general anesthesia and an adhesion model was created on the antimesenteric side of the cecum in groups i ii and iii
10092,group i received mg kg ellagic acid and group ii mg kg diclofenac sodium through the nasogastric catheter while group iii received no medication
10093,only laparotomy was performed in group iv
10094,the rats were sacrificed at the end of the th day
10095,following macroscopic scoring tissue samples were removed and subjected to biochemical and histopathologic evaluation
10096,the degree of adhesion and the malondialdehyde level were decreased p and glutathione level increased p in group i compared to group ii and group iii
10097,the effects of ellagic acid on the prevention of peritoneal adhesion were found to be stronger than diclofenac sodium
10098,this can be explained by the fact that ellagic acid is a strong antioxidant and decreases oxidative stress with anti inflammatory and anti angiogenic effects
10099,chemometrics assisted uv spectrophotometric and rp hplc methods are presented for the simultaneous determination of tolperisone hydrochloride tol and diclofenac sodium dic from their combined pharmaceutical dosage form

10110,the aim of this study was to determine the ability of dc to protect mice from a virulent salmonella infection
10111,dc injected at microg g and microg g mouse body weight significantly protected animals from the lethality of salmonella infection
10112,as was the case for the in vitro interaction dc in combination with streptomycin was even more effective
10113,the non antibiotic drug dc has potential for the management of problematic antibiotic resistant bacterial infections
10114,an investigator blind parallel group multicentre study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of once daily sustained release s r ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium in patients mean age years suffering from painful osteoarthritis affecting chiefly the knee and or hip

10116,clinical assessments were performed prior to initiating therapy and after and days of treatment
10117,both treatments were efficacious but statistically significant differences in favour of s r ibuprofen were observed for the principal measure of efficacy the investigator s assessment of the overall change in clinical condition by day of ibuprofen treated patients vs of diclofenac treated patients were much improved p
10118,patients assessments of the efficacy of their treatment also favoured s r ibuprofen at day for the relief of night pain p at day for alleviation of day pain p and for the ability to carry out normal activities p and at both days and for quality of sleep p and respectively
10119,the patients overall opinion of treatment was also significantly in favour of s r ibuprofen which was rated good or excellent by compared with only of patients receiving s r diclofenac sodium p
10120,two patients receiving s r diclofenac sodium ceased treatment owing to dizziness and severe diarrhoea respectively there were no withdrawals in the ibuprofen treated group
10121,ten patients in the s r diclofenac group reported a total of adverse events mostly gastrointestinal in nature compared with three patients in the s r ibuprofen group who reported only three events abdominal pain insomnia and constipation
10122,in conclusion although both nsaid treatments improved the clinical condition of patients with painful osteoarthritis statistically significant differences in favour of once daily s r ibuprofen mg were demonstrated in terms of efficacy indicating a potential therapeutic advantage for this formulation
10123,ibuprofen was also better tolerated than diclofenac sodium mg day the latter being associated with gastrointestinal side effects in a significant proportion of patients
10124,sustained release ibuprofen brufen retard thus represents an important addition to the available therapeutic armamentarium of once daily nsaid formulations

10149,data from animal studies suggest that nsaids induced gastric damage may be due to increased gastric motility
10150,such a mechanism however has never been tested or demonstrated in man
10151,we evaluated the effects of two frequently prescribed nsaids indomethacin and diclofenac sodium on postprandial gastric motor activity a physiologically reproducible stimulus in healthy volunteers to see whether these compounds increase gastric motility
10152,twenty four healthy volunteers of both sexes years of age underwent a basal gastric motility recording
10153,thereafter they were randomized in three groups to receive either placebo indomethacin mg three times a day or diclofenac sodium mg three times a day for a week
10154,at the end of the week they underwent an identical manometric study
10155,analysis of the motility tracings showed no difference in gastric antral motility index and in amplitude of gastric antral contractions after nsaids with respect to the basal study and to the placebo group
10156,about of subjects two in the placebo group complained of side effects
10157,these were transient and mild except in two subjects taking indomethacin in whom endoscopy was necessary one of these had a small prepyloric ulcer
10158,it is concluded that in man nsaid related gastric damage is unlikely to be due to increased gastric motility
10159,in humans diclofenac sodium voltaren a potent anti inflammatory agent is metabolized to a large extent by hydroxylation and conjugation to glucuronides and sulfates

10162,the method has been applied to analyse urine samples of volunteers treated with single doses of diclofenac sodium
10163,plasma and synovial fluid concentrations of diclofenac sodium and its principal hydroxylated metabolites have been measured in sixteen rheumatoid patients on chronic therapy to investigate possible reasons for the drug s extended duration of action despite its apparent short elimination half life in plasma
10164,diclofenac was detected in synovial fluid h after dosing but at a lower level than in plasma
10165,thereafter synovial fluid concentrations remained relatively constant through to h post dosing whereas plasma levels in the same period declined rapidly from an initially high peak to near the sensitivity limit of the assay
10166,hydroxylated metabolites free conjugated were rapidly formed with measurable concentrations of the and mono and dihydroxy derivatives being detected in plasma h after dosing levels of the hydroxy metabolite were negligible at this time
10167,initially plasma levels of all metabolites were higher than those in synovial fluid but after h synovial fluid levels were equal to or slightly higher than those in plasma
10168,the significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the drug s overall clinical effect

10809,the method is applied for the determination of the pharmacokinetic parameters of diclofenac after administration of two formulations enteric coated tablet and slow release tablet to a healthy male volunteer
10810,using the laser flare cell meter lfmc we have previously determined the intensity and pattern of post alt ocular inflammation
10811,inflammation peak occurs hours after alt and clinically relevant inflammation is seen in of pigmentary glaucomas pig of pseudoexfoliative glaucomas pexg but only in of primary open angle glaucomas poag
10812,we also showed that topical diclofenac reduced inflammation in all treated patients
10813,prostaglandins are thought to play a major role in alt inflammation and it is therefore logical to assume that nsaid are effective in that situation and will probably advantageously replace corticosteroids
10814,in order to assess the anti inflammatory effect of diclofenac drops voltaren ophtha we included a total of pig or pexg in the diclofenac and in the placebo group scheduled for alt in prospective randomized placebo controlled study
10815,visual acuity tonometry and lfcm flare measure were performed before hours days after alt
10816,topical diclofenac or placebo was given before and after alt and then qid for a total of days
10817,mean maximal flare increase was significantly less in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group ph msec v ph msec p less than
10818,flare increase compared to pre alt values was significant at and days after alt in the placebo group only p less than p less than no significant flare increase occurred in the diclofenac group

10820,conventional dosage form is nowadays mostly replaced by sustained release formulation in order to increase drug efficacy and patient compliance
10821,the sustained release properties of the pvp k alone and in combination with guar gum xanthan gum and gum tragacanth were evaluated using diclofenac sodium mg tablet as a model drug
10822,tablets were processed using wet granulation method and evaluated for sustained drug release properties
10823,the drug release from the formulations was studied in relationship with commercially available diclofenac sodium sr used as a reference tablets and results were expressed as similarity f and differential factor f
10824,the tablets prepared using pvp k mg tablet sustained the release of diclofenac sodium for hours
10825,formulations where the pvp k was partially replaced with different gums also sustained the release of drug for hours
10826,the release of the drug from these formulations mainly followed higuchi model and super case ii and non fickian diffusion
10827,the in vivo drug release was studied in healthy human volunteers using non blinded cross over two period design using diclofenac sodium sr tablets as a reference drug
10828,the relative bioavailability of the formulation containing pvp k and gum tragacanth was the studies showed that the use of the pvp k in combination with gum tragacanth both in vitro and in vivo sustained the release of the drug
10829,diclofenac sodium is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug widely used in painful and inflammatory diseases
10830,it can exist in different hydrate phases
10831,recently the physico chemical and pharmaceutical properties of a trihydrate form named dsh were reported by the same authors
10832,this short communication discusses how samples of a same polymorphic form can display dissimilar analytical signatures when obtained by different routes
10833,data from hot stage microscopy ft ir spectroscopy x ray powder diffraction xrdp and thermal analysis were used to characterise the dsh samples prepared by different methods
10834,through the case study of diclofenac sodium this work highlights how the method used to prepare a specific crystal modification can generate samples with different morphologies and therefore different properties and physical stability
10835,the aim of this prospective randomised double blind study was to evaluate the efficacy of intramuscular im tramadol mg in emergency department treatment of acute migraine attack and to compare it with that of im diclofenac sodium mg forty patients who were admitted to our emergency department with acute migraine attack according to the international headache society criteria were included in the study
10836,patients were randomised to receive either tramadol mg n or diclofenac sodium mg n intramuscularly
10837,patients rated their pain on a four point verbal scale none mild moderate severe at the beginning of the trial and at and min
10838,at each time interval severity of associated symptoms were also questioned and recorded
10839,global evaluation of the drugs by patients and doctors were also recorded
10840,patients were also asked if they would prefer the same injection in future visits
10841,any adverse events whether related to the drug or not were also recorded
10842,patients were followed up by telephone h later to check for any headache recurrence
10843,two hour pain response rate which was the primary endpoint was for both tramadol and diclofenac groups
10844,there were no statistically significant differences among groups in terms of h pain response rescue treatment associated symptoms response headache recurrence and adverse event rates
10845,fifteen patients in the tramadol group and patients in the diclofenac group stated that they may prefer the same agent for future admissions
10846,in selected patients tramadol mg im may be an effective and reliable alternative treatment choice in acute migraine attacks
10847,this paper presents the application of the regression analysis program and the program for comparing linear regressions modified method for one way analysis of variance writtens in basic program language for instance determination of content of diclofenac sodium active ingredient in diklofen injections ampules mg ml
10848,stability testing of diclofenac sodium was done by isothermic method of accelerated aging at different temperatures degrees degrees degrees and degrees c as a function of time different duration of treatment and days
10849,the decrease in stability decrease in the mean value of the content of diclofenac sodium in at different temperatures as a function of time is possible to describe by linear dependance
10850,according to the value for regression equation values the times are assessed in which the content of diclofenac sodium in will decrease by of the initial value
10851,the times are follows at degrees c days at degrees c days at degrees c days and at degrees c days
10852,the estimated times in days in which the mean value for diclofenac sodium content in will by of the initial values as a junction of time are most suitably described by rd order parabola
10853,based on the parameter values which describe the rd order parabola the time was estimated in which diclofenac sodium content mean value in will fall by of the initial one at average ambient temperatures of degrees c and degrees c the times are days degrees c and days degrees c
10854,based on the value for fischer s coefficien f the comparison of trenf of diclofenac sodium content in shows that under the influence of different temperatures as a function of time among them depending on temperature value there is statistically very significant difference p at degrees c and lower toward degrees c i e
10855,statistically probably significant difference p at degrees c and lower towards degrees c and there is no statistically significance difference p at degrees c towards degrees c
10856,a xanthan gum matrix controlled release tablet formulation containing diclofenac sodium was evaluated in vitro and was found to release the drug at a uniform rate
10857,the gastrointestinal transit behaviour of the formulation as determined by gamma scintigraphy using healthy male volunteers under fasted and fed conditions indicated that gastric emptying was delayed with food intake
10858,in contrast the small intestinal transit remained practically unchanged under both food statuses
10859,therefore the delay in caecal arrival observed in the fed state can be attributed to the delay in gastric emptying
10860,rate of diclofenac sodium absorption was generally higher in the fed state compared to the fasted state however the total amount absorbed under both food statuses remained practically the same
10861,the rate of in vivo dissolution of the drug in the fed state was faster compared to that in the fasted state
10862,thus at the time of caecal arrival in vivo dissolution was complete in the fed state unlike in the fasted state where almost of the drug was delivered to the colon
10863,data from sustained release and enteric coated oral formulations and the suppository formulation of diclofenac sodium are fitted simultaneously using nonmem and the general linear model advan absorption and disposition parameters serum levels and absorption profiles were determined
10864,the in vivo absorption profiles were determined using the program topfit
10865,the in vivo absorption for the sustained release formulation is slow first order and follows a flip flop model since disposition rate constants are greater than absorption rate constants
10866,absorption from the enteric coated form is essentially complete or at about h while it is complete at h from the sustained release formulation
10867,this suggests likely absorption from the colon in the case of the sustained release formulation since absorption is only complete during the first h the sustained release relative bioavailability is
10868,absorption from the suppository is essentially complete at about h however the relative bioavailability of the suppository formulation is low since defecation may remove the drug from the absorption site before complete absorption
10869,in a placebo controlled double blind between patient trial the antipyretic effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren was studied in forty three children ranging from years of age
10870,all patients were hospitalized because of acute illness associated with fever degrees c degrees c mean degrees c due to viral or bacterial infections
10871,the trial medication was given in the form of suppositories containing mg of diclofenac sodium or as matching placebo to children aged from years
10872,the children aged from years received a mg diclofenac sodium suppository or placebo
10873,body temperature and pulse rate were measured at the time of administration and after and hours
10874,the results showed a return to normal temperature values after hours in all patients receiving diclofenac sodium whereas in the placebo group only minimal changes were observed
10875,no unwanted effects were reported
10876,knee osteoarthritis is a common form of arthritis in elderly patients that is characterised by pain and functional limitation
10877,moxibustion has been employed to relieve chronic pain as an alternative therapy for knee osteoarthritis
10878,however the evidence of its efficacy is equivocal due to the low methodological quality in most clinical studies
10879,therefore we are performing a double blinded double placebo randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of moxibustion in participants with knee osteoarthritis
10880,this is a multicentre double blinded double placebo randomised controlled clinical trial
10881,eligible participants with knee osteoarthritis will be randomly assigned to two different groups in a ratio
10882,participants in the moxibustion group will undergo active moxibustion plus placebo gel whereas participants in the control group will receive diclofenac sodium gel plus placebo moxibustion
10883,each participant will receive sessions of active placebo moxibustion at three acupoints st st and ex le as well as months of follow up
10884,diclofenac sodium gel or placebo gel at a dose of g per knee will be applied three times per day for weeks
10885,the primary outcome measure will be the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index womac score change at the end of the intervention period from baseline
10886,the secondary outcome measures include changes of other subscales pain stiffness and function of womac visual analogue scale and patient globalassessment
10887,the safety of moxibustion and diclofenac sodium gel will be assessed at every visit
10888,this trial has been approved by the sichuan regional ethics review committee permission number kl
10889,the results of this study are expected to provide clinical evidence on the efficacy of moxibustion for pain relief and physical function improvement in patients with knee osteoarthritis
10890,the findings will be submitted for publication in peer reviewed medical journals and presented at relevant academic conferences
10892,a study on the transdermal permeation through human skin was performed with a series of semisolid formulations a f containing sodium diclofenac cas w w
10893,a commercially available drug preparation was tested as a reference
10894,based on permeation characteristics a study on the topical and systemic anti inflammatory activities of three formulations a f and the reference formulation was conducted using the model of erythema induced by uv radiation in hairless rats
10895,this is expected together with the index of topical anti inflammatory activity to allow the selection of the most suitable formulation for dermal application
10896,the following representative parameters were measured in the permeation study amount of diclofenac permeated at h flow lag time and amount of drug retained in skin at h of the formulations tested diclofenac formulated in the reference formulation showed the highest values of amount of diclofenac permeated at h amount of drug retained in skin at and flow
10897,as regards the skin inflammation test no significant differences p are seen between the topical and systemic anti inflammatory activities of the three formulations tested
10898,however in absolute value formulation f shows a lower systemic activity which would prevent potential side effects of diclofenac
10899,since the topical anti inflammatory index obtained for this formulation was it is concluded that a good therapeutic performance could be obtained in the treatment of local inflammation with diclofenac by using formulation f
10900,a double blind crossover study was undertaken in general practice to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new controlled release indomethacin with sustained release diclofenac sodium in patients with osteoarthritis
10901,eighty four patients were randomly allocated to receive controlled release indomethacin tablets mg or sustained release diclofenac sodium tablets mg at night for a period of weeks before being crossed over to receive the alternative treatment for a further weeks
10902,pain scores for day and night duration of morning stiffness requirement for escape analgesia and treatment preference were similar for both treatments
10903,there was no significant difference between treatments for incidence and severity of side effects
10904,it was concluded that controlled release indomethacin tablets mg given as a single night time dose were as efficacious and well tolerated as sustained release diclofenac sodium mg
10905,to evaluate the analgesic effect of topical sodium diclofenac before retinal laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy
10906,diabetic patients who were candidates for peripheral laser photocoagulation were included in a randomized placebo controlled intraindividual two period and crossover clinical trial
10907,at the first session and based on randomization one eye received topical sodium diclofenac and the other eye received an artificial tear drop as placebo three times before laser treatment
10908,at the second session eyes were given the alternate drug
10909,patients scored their pain using visual analogue scale max cm at both sessions
10910,patients and the surgeon were blinded to the drops given
10911,difference of pain level was the main outcome measure
10912,a total of eyes of patients were enrolled
10913,both treatments were matched regarding the applied laser
10914,pain sensation based on visual analogue scale was in the treated group and in the control group
10915,the calculated treatment effect was confidence interval to
10916,pretreatment with topical sodium diclofenac does not have any analgesic effect during peripheral retinal laser photocoagulation in diabetic patients
10917,we investigated the effects of diclofenac sodium ds on development of the optic nerve in utero
10918,pregnant female rats were separated into three groups control saline treated and ds treated
10919,offspring of these animals were divided into week old and week old groups
10920,at the end of the th and th weeks of postnatal life the animals were sacrificed and right optic nerves were excised and sectioned for ultrastructural and stereological analyses
10921,we demonstrated that both ds and saline produced structural and morphometric changes in the total axon number and density of axons but decreased the myelin sheath thickness in male optic nerves
10922,all ultrastructural and morphometric features were well developed in week old rats
10923,we showed that development of the optic nerve continues during the early postnatal period and that some compensation for exposure to deleterious agents in utero may occur during early postnatal life
10924,many patients experience pain for a short duration after conventional radiofrequency crf denervation for lumbar facet pain
10925,the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and cost of administering diclofenac sodium for the relief of pain after crf denervation
10926,after denervation patients were randomly allocated into three groups to receive either placebo for days group a diclofenac sodium for days group b or diclofenac sodium for days group c
10927,the patients pain visual analgesia score vas and side effect were recorded at baseline and days after treatment
10928,oswestry disability index odi patients satisfaction score pss and dosage and cost of the drugs used for pain management were recorded at baseline and days after treatment
10929,vas in groups b and c both was less than that in group a at and days after treatment p and respectively
10930,pss in groups b and c was significantly better than in group a at and days after treatment p
10931,the rate of side effects was similar among the three groups at all times p
10932,the cost of analgesic administration in group b was significantly less than in groups a and c p
10933,diclofenac sodium administration improves analgesia and the pss after crf denervation
10934,compared to a day dosage a day diclofenac sodium therapy has similar efficacy and less cost for the treatment of pain after crf neurotomy
10935,to investigate time and ph dependent colon specific drug delivery systems cdds for orally administered diclofenac sodium ds and aminosalicylic acid asa respectively
10936,ds tablets and asa pellets were coated by ethylcellulose ec and methacrylic acid copolymers eudragit l and s respectively
10937,the in vitro release behavior of the ds coated tablets and asa coated pellets were examined and then in vivo absorption kinetics of ds coated tablets in dogs were further studied
10938,release profile of time dependent ds coated tablets was not influenced by ph of the dissolution medium but the lag time of ds release was primarily controlled by the thickness of the coating layer
10939,the thicker the coating layer the longer the lag time of ds release is
10940,on the contrary in view of the ph dependent asa coated pellets asa release was significantly governed by ph
10941,moreover the asa release features from the coated pellets depended upon both the combination ratio of the eudragit l and s ph sensitive copolymers in the coating formulation and the thickness of the coating layer
10942,the absorption kinetic studies of the ds coated tablets in dogs demonstrated that in vivo lag time of absorption was in a good agreement with in vitro lag time of release
10943,two types of cdds prepared herein by means of the regular coating technique are able to achieve site specific drug delivery targeting at colon following oral administration and provide a promising strategy to control drug release targeting the desired lower gastrointestinal region
10944,topical application times daily for weeks of the diclofenac hyaluronan gel to osteoarthritis patients induced a significantly greater p analgesic effect than placebo gel lacking the active substance applied to control patients
10945,to determine if topical ophthalmic diclofenac sodium solution alters renal parameters in the domestic chicken and to determine if the drug is detectable in plasma after topical ophthalmic administration
10946,thirty healthy domestic chickens

10948,treatments were provided every h in all groups
10949,pre and post treatment plasma samples from all birds were evaluated for changes in albumin total protein and uric acid
10950,post treatment samples of all birds collected min post administration were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry for diclofenac sodium detection
10951,a randomly selected renal sample from each group was submitted for histopathologic review
10952,changes in pre and post treatment plasma albumin were significant p in groups and but not for group pre and post treatment changes in total protein and uric acid were not significant for any group
10953,diclofenac sodium was not detectable limit of detection ng ml in plasma samples from birds in group post treatment concentration of diclofenac in group was statistically greater than group p
10954,histopathologic changes did not identify diclofenac induced acute renal tubular necrosis
10955,ophthalmic diclofenac sodium administered topically every h in one or both eyes for days is detectable in systemic circulation in the domestic chicken but does not cause overt significant changes in plasma uric acid or total protein
10956,diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug used for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis
10957,our primary objective was to compare bioavailability and tolerability of a generic sustained release tablet with the established reference sustained release tablet of diclofenac sodium in a fasting healthy chinese male population
10958,a randomized open label single and multiple dose study design was used
10959,after the single dose volunteers received diclofenac sodium sustained release tablet once daily for days
10960,in the single dose phase blood samples were collected from to hours after drug administration
10961,in the multiple dose phase samples were obtained before drug administration at am on days and to determine cmin ss of diclofenac sodium on day samples were collected from to hours

10966,this diclofenac sodium mg tablet has features compatible with the mg sustained release tablet and appeared to be well tolerated
10967,clinicaltrials gov identifier l
10968,the first part of the monograph presented the premises and equations which are the basis for the proposed mathematical n order model
10969,this non linear physical model obeying the laws of chemical kinetics was used to describe the processes of active substance release from drug form
10970,the possibilities of its application in the mathematical description and detailed analysis of the kinetics of paracetamol and sodium diclofenac release from various viscosity gels based on methylcellulose were investigated
10971,moreover the effect of temperature on the release profiles of the above mentioned active substances from investigated formulations was analyzed
10972,on the basis of a series of performed experiments and detailed comparative statistical analysis of the estimators of two parameters characterizing n order model release rate constant k and order coefficient of the release process n it was demonstrated that the active substance release rate from formulations with uncontrolled release is correlated with actual order of the process
10973,also the proposed n order model was compared with models obeying the laws of chemical kinetics order model order model and with diffusion higuchi square root of time model and the comparison demonstrated superiority of the n order model over standard models
10974,a non linear statistical analysis was performed by means of computer software statistica pl

10976,the efficacy and tolerability of a new controlled release indomethacin mg tablet was compared to that of a sustained release diclofenac sodium mg tablet in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
10977,the study was designed as a double blind double dummy crossover trial patients being allocated at random to receive active tablet and placebo tablet of the alternative medication at night for weeks before being crossed over to the alternative treatment for a further weeks
10978,patient and clinical assessments on entry and at the end of each treatment period showed that pain scores for day and night duration of morning stiffness requirement for escape analgesia paracetamol and treatment preference were similar for both treatments
10979,both preparations also significantly improved the degree of joint tenderness compared to baseline p less than as measured by a modified ritchie articular index
10980,incidence and severity of side effects were comparable with a significant improvement in degree of constipation reported for both treatments compared to baseline p less than
10981,the incidence and severity of headache was statistically significantly worse p less than for controlled release indomethacin however there was no difference in any other parameter of tolerability
10982,it was concluded that controlled release indomethacin tablets mg given as a single night time dose were as efficacious and well tolerated as sustained release diclofenac sodium mg
10983,h urinary pyrophosphate excretion was studied in normal healthy subjects and idiopathic stone formers from north western regions of india
10984,the mean hour urinary excretion of pyrophosphate was significantly low in stone formers mumol h as compared to that of normal subjects mumol h p less than
10985,diclofenac sodium a non steroidal anti inflammatory agent was administered mg thrice daily for week to stone formers and hour urinary pyrophosphate excretion was studied before and after drug therapy
10986,the hour urinary excretion of pyrophosphate increased from to mumol subsequent to diclofenac sodium therapy p less than
10987,the objective of this research was to characterize the dissolution profile of a poorly soluble drug diclofenac from a commercially available multiple unit enteric coated dosage form diclo puren capsules and to develop a predictive model for its oral pharmacokinetic profile
10988,the paddle method was used to obtain the dissolution profiles of this dosage form in biorelevant media with the exposure to simulated gastric conditions being varied in order to simulate the gastric emptying behavior of pellets
10989,a modified noyes whitney theory was subsequently fitted to the dissolution data
10990,a physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk model for multiple unit dosage forms was designed using stella software and coupled with the biorelevant dissolution profiles in order to simulate the plasma concentration profiles of diclofenac from diclo puren capsule in both the fasted and fed state in humans
10991,gastric emptying kinetics relevant to multiple units pellets were incorporated into the pbpk model by setting up a virtual patient population to account for physiological variations in emptying kinetics
10992,using in vitro biorelevant dissolution coupled with in silico pbpk modeling and simulation it was possible to predict the plasma profile of this multiple unit formulation of diclofenac after oral administration in both the fasted and fed state
10993,this approach might be useful to predict variability in the plasma profiles for other drugs housed in multiple unit dosage forms
10994,oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and cyclooxygenase selective inhibitors are frequently recommended for management of osteoarthritis oa
10995,however serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systemic adverse events aes are associated with oral nsaids and can be treatment limiting
10996,the efficacy of diclofenac sodium topical solution w w with dimethyl sulfoxide tdiclo has been established as superior to placebo and comparable with oral nsaids in the management of oa
10997,this study characterizes the safety and tolerability profile of tdiclo compared with placebo through a pooled analysis of data from patients in randomized controlled trials across centers in the united states and centers in canada
10998,patients received tdiclo n or placebo n for to weeks for management of oa of the hand or knee
10999,the most frequently reported ae was dry skin occurring in of patients receiving tdiclo and of patients receiving placebo p
11000,dyspepsia was the most common gastrointestinal reaction reported by of patients receiving tdiclo and of patients receiving placebo p
11001,changes in vital signs and laboratory assessments of hepatic and renal function were similar between the groups tdiclo did not increase mean blood pressure nor was it associated with hypertension
11002,the rate of serious aes favored placebo in both groups for tdiclo vs for placebo p as did the rate of severe aes vs p
11003,the most common reason for study discontinuation was dry skin vs
11004,results from this analysis suggest that tdiclo is well tolerated in a large population and may offer an alternative to oral nsaid therapy for oa of the knee or hand particularly for patients at increased risk for serious systemic aes
11005,larger head to head long term multicenter trials would be beneficial to further evaluate safety data comparing both topical and oral nsaids
11006,actinic keratoses aks are a common precancerous condition and are said to account for of visits to dermatologists in the us each year
11007,along with cryotherapy topical treatments are a mainstay of therapy for these lesions
11008,one of the potential benefits of topical therapy is less pain and irritation as compared to cryotherapy
11009,additionally topical therapies have a perceived benefit of treating subclinical lesions along with clinically evident keratoses
11010,we conducted a bilateral comparison study of the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac gel used for days and fluorouracil cream used for days in thirty patients with ak of the face and scalp
11011,the diclofenac gel and fluorouracil cream each demonstrated substantial efficacy in the number of lesions cleared and the proportion of patients with significant lesion clearing
11012,in most patients diclofenac induced only mild signs of inflammation compared to fluoruracil despite a longer treatment period
11013,a greater number of patients expressed significant satisfaction with diclofenac gel compared to the fluorouracil cream
11014,a randomised double blind single centre vehicle controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac na gel in subjects suffering from acute first degree natural sunburn
11015,overall subjects with skin phototypes ii iv were randomised in a ratio of to receive two applications of either diclofenac na emulgel gel or its vehicle emulgel gel and hours after the end of sun exposure
11016,subjects were drawn from a target population of healthy volunteers and well outdoor sunbathers with normal tolerance to ultraviolet light and the sun
11017,previously untanned areas were exposed to carefully determined standardised doses of sun individual minimal erythema doses on body surface area to induce first degree sunburn
11018,after administration of diclofenac na gel subjects reported a significant reduction in spontaneous pain intensity compared with those on vehicle
11019,pain relief was rapid with a reduction in erythema which was apparent within the first few hours after the first application of the trial medication with a maximum effect observed up to hours after sun exposure
11020,a good very good or excellent cooling effect was recorded by of subjects after treatment
11021,reported treatment emergent adverse effects were infrequent generally mild and none were considered to be related to the trial medication
11022,only one severe treatment emergent adverse event abdominal pain was recorded in the active group and another burning sensation with vehicle
11023,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids have been shown to counteract stress hormone and pro inflammatory cytokine activation
11024,to extend these findings we tested whether the nsaid diclofenac sodium would attenuate lipopolysaccharide lps induced reductions in reward behavior
11025,in the first experiment male wistar rats pressed a lever for food reward and subsequently received days treatment of saline ml kg s c or diclofenac mg kg s c
11026,on the subsequent test day rats were given a final injection of saline or diclofenac min prior to lps micrograms kg i p
11027,lps significantly reduced rate of food self administration and total reinforcers obtained and increased corticosterone levels in saline treated rats while these effects were significantly attenuated in diclofenac treated rats
11028,in the second experiment rats pressed a lever for sweetened milk
11029,in contrast to food self administration acute lps exposure did not reduce rate of responding or total reinforcers obtained in either saline or diclofenac treated rats
11030,in the third experiment rats trained to press a lever for sweetened milk were pre exposed to a high dose of lps micrograms kg i p
11031,weeks prior to a challenge injection of lps
11032,in this case lps challenge significantly reduced rate of sweetened milk self administration but not total reinforcers obtained in saline treated rats
11033,rats treated with diclofenac did not exhibit reductions in rate of responding or total reinforcers obtained
11034,overall the data indicate that the nsaid diclofenac sodium counteracts lps induced reductions in reward behavior and corticosterone release and may therefore have therapeutic potential for specific components of endotoxin induced sickness behavior including anhedonia
11035,to assess the possible therapeutic effect of mg sublingual piroxicam fast dissolving dosage form fddf compared with intramuscular mg diclofenac as a reference drug on acute renal colic in a randomized double blind controlled clinical trial
11036,eighty patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups one received an intramuscular injection with ml distilled water and two sublingual tablets of mg piroxicam fddf and the other received an intramuscular injection with mg diclofenac sodium and two sublingual tablets of placebo
11037,pain intensity was evaluated by the patient using a visual analogue scale and by the observers
11038,vital signs at baseline and min after the administration of the study drugs were also recorded
11039,the overall efficacy of the treatment was nine patients in the piroxicam and six in the diclofenac group no significant difference required rescue treatment
11040,compared with baseline levels the pain relief was significant p at min in both groups
11041,twenty two patients in the piroxicam and in the diclofenac group attained complete pain relief at min as evaluated by the observer no significant difference
11042,both treatments were similarly effective in decreasing vital signs mainly systolic blood pressure heart and respiratory rates
11043,however when the percentage change was compared between the groups piroxicam significantly decreased the respiratory rate p
11044,piroxicam fddf is as effective as parenteral diclofenac in emergency renal colic treatment
11045,furthermore its ease of self administration increases patient compliance and potential use in general practice
11046,patients undergoing craniotomy experience moderate to severe pain in postoperative period
11047,flupirtine does not have side effects like sedation and increase postoperative bleeding so it may be a useful analgesic in neurosurgical patients
11048,we designed this prospective randomized double blind placebo controlled study to evaluate the role of flupirtine for postcraniotomy pain and compare it with diclofenac sodium
11049,a total of adults to y american society of anaesthesiologists i and ii of either sex undergoing elective craniotomy were randomly divided into equal groups of each
11050,group control received placebo group diclofenac received tablet diclofenac mg and group flupirtine received capsule flupirtine mg all medications were given hourly on second postoperative day for hours
11051,visual analogue scale score level of sedation and incidence of side effects were observed
11052,nineteen patients were dropped from the study and therefore subsequent analysis was carried out for patients only
11053,there was significant reduction of visual analogue scale score in flupirtine and diclofenac group when compared to control p
11054,pain relief observed in control flupirtine and diclofenac group was and respectively
11055,need of rescue analgesia was significantly less in flupirtine and diclofenac group as compared to control p
11056,no significant difference was observed among the groups in regards to adverse effects
11057,we conclude that oral flupirtine mg is safe and as effective as oral diclofenac sodium mg in reducing postcraniotomy pain
11058,the effect of three non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac indomethacin and tolfenamic acid on the production of superoxide o by normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes pmnl was studied in vitro
11059,the cells were activated with n formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine fmlp and o production was measured as superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome c reduction
11060,cell viability was checked with assays of liberated ldh
11061,concentrations of the drugs considerably higher than those of therapeutic plasma were required to inhibit o production
11062,the drug concentrations producing a inhibition ic of total o production were diclofenac x m indomethacin x m and tolfenamic acid x m at drug concentrations causing a significant suppression of o generation diclofenac showed a slight and tolfenamic acid a marked inhibition of h fmlp binding to its cellular receptor indomethacin has earlier been shown to inhibit fmlp binding slightly
11063,no dismutating activity of the drugs could be demonstrated
11064,it is concluded that the inhibition of o production is due to a combined effect on fmlp binding and on cellular o metabolism
11065,because of the high drug concentrations required to inhibit o production this phenomenon is obviously of little significance for the anti inflammatory effect obtained with therapeutic doses of the drugs studied
11066,to evaluate the long term effects of treatment with diclofenac sodium in hyaluronic acid gel on clinically diagnosed actinic keratosis lesions in well defined skin areas
11067,a one year extension of a phase single arm multicenter open label study was conducted
11068,patients in the original study received diclofenac sodium gel twice daily for days
11069,the extension study consisted of a single evaluation approximately one year post treatment
11071,patients who had completed the initial treatment phase with no further treatment for actinic keratosis in the designated treatment blocks
11072,the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving percent clearance of actinic keratosis lesions at one year follow up based on percent change from baseline in target lesion number score or cumulative lesion number score
11073,secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving percent actinic keratosis lesion clearance and change in investigator s global improvement index scores
11074,eighty one percent of patients reported no additional treatment for actinic keratosis lesions for one year after completing treatment with diclofenac sodium gel
11075,the proportion of patients with percent clearance after one year was percent ci for target lesions and percent ci for cumulative lesions
11076,the proportion of patients with percent clearance at one year was percent ci for target lesions and percent ci for cumulative lesions
11077,investigator s global improvement index severity scores showed that the majority of patients improved from baseline after one year
11078,the efficacy of a single day course of diclofenac sodium gel persisted in the majority of patients at one year
11079,j clin aesthetic dermatol
11082,xanthan gum xg a trisaccharide branched polymer and poly vinyl alcohol pva was used to develop ph sensitive interpenetrating network ipn microspheres by emulsion cross linking method in the presence of glutaraldehyde as a cross linker to deliver model anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium ds to the intestine
11083,various formulations were prepared by changing the ratio of xg pva extent of cross linking in order to optimize the formulation variables on drug encapsulation efficiency and release rate
11084,formation of interpenetrating network and the chemical stability of ds after penetration of microspheres was confirmed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy
11085,differential scanning calorimetry dsc and x ray diffraction xrd analysis were done on the drug loaded microspheres which confirmed molecular dispersion of ds in the ipn
11086,microspheres formed were spherical with smooth surfaces as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy sem and mean particle size as measured by laser light scattering technique ranged between microm
11087,drug encapsulation of up to was achieved as measured by uv method
11088,both equilibrium and dynamic swelling studies and in vitro release studies were performed in ph and release data indicated a fickian trend of drug release which depends on the extent of cross linking and the ratio of xg pva present in the microsphere
11089,when subjected to in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation in rabbits microparticles show slow and prolonged drug release when compared with ds solution
11090,based on the results of in vitro and in vivo studies it was concluded that these ipn microspheres provided oral controlled release of water soluble ds
11091,diclofenac sodium is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug widely used in painful and inflammatory diseases
11092,it can exist in different hydrate phases
11093,by exposure to different conditions of temperature and relative humidity can be isolated a trihydrate form never described in literature
11094,the methods of preparation of the trihydrate form named dsh were described and its physico chemical properties were investigated
11095,data from ftir spectroscopy x ray powder diffraction and thermal analysis were used for identification and characterisation of dsh in comparison with the anhydrous form ds the commercial form and the hydrate form dsh obtained by exposure of ds to relative humidity even below and already described and characterised in a previous article of the same authors
11096,intrinsic dissolution studies were performed to compare the pharmaceutical properties of ds and dsh with dsh since this form was accidentally found on the italian market as active pharmaceutical ingredient api
11097,this work stresses the importance of assessing the correct crystalline form also in api of well established use to guarantee quality safety and efficacy of the final dosage form
11098,furthermore this study suggests that isomorphic hydrate forms with a different dislocation of water within the crystal structures can exist
11099,recommendations state that acetaminophen should be used in preference to nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs in the initial treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis oa of the hip or knee because of lesser toxicity and the pervasive belief that acetaminophen is not only effective in treating oa pain but is of equal analgesic efficacy as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs
11100,this was a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial of diclofenac sodium mg twice daily vs acetaminophen mg times daily in subjects with symptomatic oa of the medial knee
11101,osteoarthritis was quantitated radiographically and subjects met stringent baseline pain criteria
11102,the primary evaluation of efficacy used the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index with evaluations at screening baseline and and weeks after treatment
11103,intention to treat analysis was used
11104,twenty five subjects were randomized to diclofenac to acetaminophen and to placebo
11105,the groups were closely matched for age sex body mass index prior use of oa medications baseline pain and radiographic features
11106,at and weeks clinically and statistically significant p improvements were seen in the diclofenac treated group however no significant improvements were seen in the acetaminophen treated group p at weeks and at weeks
11107,stratification of subjects according to baseline pain prestudy oa medication and radiographic grade showed no clear pattern of preferential response to diclofenac and did not reveal a subset of subjects who responded to acetaminophen
11108,diclofenac is effective in the symptomatic treatment of oa of the knee but acetaminophen is not
11109,a review of the literature reveals that there is scanty published evidence for a therapeutic effect of acetaminophen relative to placebo in patients with oa of the knee because most published studies use active comparators ie nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs only
11110,the advocacy of acetaminophen use in subjects with oa of the knee should be reconsidered pending further placebo controlled studies
11111,analgesic drugs either opioids or non opioids are required and useful for controlling postoperative pain after cesarean section
11112,the analgesic and opioid sparing effects of repeated intramuscular i m
11113,injections of mg of diclofenac sodium given immediately after the experiencing of pain following cesarean section under general anesthesia were studied and compared with placebo in a double blind trial
11114,one hundred twenty patients years of age undergoing elective lower segment cesarean section were treated with either mg diclofenac sodium i m
11115,patients or identical placebo patients once patients awakened from anesthesia and experienced wound pain
11116,their initial responses to either treatment during the first hour after administration of medications were studied
11117,the analgesic sedative and opioid sparing effects of the medications were also studied during the next h side effects including uterine relaxation and bleeding were compared between patients administered placebo and diclofenac
11118,results showed that patients showed significant pain relief within the first h after administration of diclofenac sodium and their mean pain score decreased from to p
11119,within the same period patients responded to placebo injections and mean pain score decreased from to p
11120,during the first postoperative h patients showed complete pain relief with use of diclofenac alone while patients required mg of pethidine in addition to diclofenac treatment
11121,all patients using placebo required pethidine injection the total amount of pethidine used was mg per h verbal scores for sedation were lower in patients treated with diclofenac than in patients treated with placebo at and h postoperatively p
11122,there were no significant differences in the proportions of patients who required oxytocin infusion due to uterine relaxation in the diclofenac treated and the placebo treated groups vs p
11123,it might be concluded that repeated i m
11124,injections of mg diclofenac sodium maximum two injections per day could relieve postoperative pain after cesarean section and significantly reduce opioid analgesic requirements without significant effects on uterine relaxation or bleeding during the first postoperative h
11125,some of the factors affecting the steady state transport rate of diclofenac sodium across excised guinea pig skin during high frequency pulse iontophoresis were examined
11126,the same mathematical expression was employed for enhancement ratio as a function of applied voltage as the one derived for direct current iontophoresis
11127,the effective voltage drop across the skin was only of the applied voltage
11128,the steady state flux value increased with increase of the donor concentration
11129,to evaluate and compare the analgesic activity of fixed dose combinations fdc of paracetamol with diclofenac sodium and paracetamol with tramadol on different human pain models in healthy human volunteers
11130,a randomized double blind crossover study was carried out in healthy human volunteers using three pain models cold water stress test radiant heat method and bp cuff inflation method
11131,the subjects were randomized into two groups of each group a received fdc of paracetamol mg with diclofenac sodium mg and group b was given a fdc of paracetamol mg and tramadol mg all the volunteers were tested on three pain models
11132,observations for pain tolerance were recorded at baseline and at the interval of and minutes after drug administration
11133,crossover was done after a washout period of days
11134,the results of both the study periods were analyzed using an independent t test
11135,mean age of the participants was years and the male female ratio was in the radiant heat method paracetamol with tramadol combination treatment showed a significant increase in pain tolerance at hours and hours p and respectively compared to paracetamol with diclofenac combination
11136,other two pain models did not show any significant difference in the study groups
11137,paracetamol with tramadol combination was more effective than paracetamol with diclofenac sodium combination on the radiant heat model
11138,in human pain models there is an incomplete understanding of mechanisms and activated pathways are not precisely determined that needs further evaluation
11139,to assess platelet function and safety following single dose administration of a novel formulation of intravenous iv diclofenac sodium dyloject mg versus oral diclofenac mg iv ketorolac mg and oral acetylsalicylic acid asa mg
11140,open label randomized single dose treatment crossover study
11141,clinical research unit
11142,healthy asa physical status i adult men
11143,subjects were randomized to one of treatment sequences that included single dose treatments
11144,study drug administration occurred on days and
11145,platelet count closure time as measured by platelet function analyzer pfa prothrombin time pt activated partial thromboplastin time aptt and plasma concentrations of the study drugs were obtained over hours after each treatment
11146,the primary endpoint was the area under the curve for pfa collagen epinephrine cepi closure time difference from hours post drug administration auc h
11147,secondary endpoints included the maximum change from baseline in pfa cepi closure time
11148,auc h mean sd for cepi closure time difference was significantly smaller after iv diclofenac mg sec hrs than after ketorolac and asa sec hrs and sec hrs respectively p for both but not after the oral diclofenac control sec hrs p
11149,similarly the maximum change from baseline in pfa cepi closure time was lower after iv diclofenac than after ketorolac or asa across all time intervals examined
11150,there were no significant changes in pt or aptt at any time point with any treatment
11151,there was a low frequency of adverse events
11152,acetylsalicylic acid and ketorolac both substantially disrupted platelet function in contrast to iv diclofenac mg or oral diclofenac mg control
11153,diclofenac with its balanced cox and cox inhibitory profile may pose less risk of postoperative bleeding than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids such as ketorolac and asa which predominantly inhibit cox
11154,reverse micellar solutions of diclofenac sodium were encapsulated in soft gelatine capsules
11155,on contact with aqueous media they exhibited an application induced transformation ait into a semisolid system of liquid crystals sslc which slows down drug release
11156,the aim of the present paper was to study in vitro and in vivo drug release from these systems after rectal application
11157,in vitro drug release was determined in a self constructed dissolution apparatus to simulate rectal application
11158,for in vivo bioavailability studies rabbits were used as animal models
11159,in vitro release and in vivo bioavailability of the capsules was compared to voltaren suppositories
11160,the release profiles of the in vitro experiments show zero order kinetics
11161,the in vivo bioavailability studies show bioequivalence in terms of auc for both formulations capsules and voltaren suppositories
11162,the mean residence time parameter of sustained release of the capsules is three time longer in comparison to voltaren suppositories
11163,rectal administration of capsules provides an appropriate route for controlled release via ait sslc which could be clearly verified in rabbits
11164,models with experimentally induced pain in healthy man might be useful for the screening for analgesic effects of new drugs
11165,experimental pain models have been shown to discriminate reliably between the effects of opioid analgesics and placebo but their sensitivity to nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents is disputed
11166,this study investigated whether it would be possible by using electrically and thermally induced cutaneous pain to discriminate reliably the effects of single oral doses of and mg diclofenac sodium on the one hand and mg codeine on the other from those of placebo
11167,forty eight healthy subjects participated each in four experiments in which they received in random double blind fashion each of the treatments
11168,every experiment comprised eight series of measurements two before and six after drug administration carried out at min intervals
11169,diclofenac sodium produced significant dose related increases of threshold and tolerance to electrically and threshold to thermally induced pain
11170,codeine mg was significantly superior to placebo in all pain measures
11171,its analgesic effects were stronger than those of diclofenac mg but weaker than those of diclofenac mg neither mg nor mg diclofenac caused more side effects than placebo whereas codeine mg elicited a high frequency of side effects
11172,no severe adverse effects occurred after any one treatment
11173,the results suggest that both electrically and thermally induced cutaneous pain are well suited to evaluate analgesic effects not only of opioids but also of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs
11174,a six week double blind randomized parallel group multicentre study was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip to compare the efficacy tolerability and safety of flurbiprofen sr mg with diclofenac sodium sr mg between group comparisons based on change scores from baseline we detected no significant differences between the two drugs with respect to efficacy for the majority of outcome measures
11175,there was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of patients experiencing at least one adverse medical event or in terminations from treatment
11176,we conclude that flurbiprofen sr mg is similar in efficacy tolerability and safety to diclofenac sodium sr in this trial
11177,a simple and highly sensitive sensor for the determination of diclofenac sodium based on gold nanoparticle multi walled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode is reported
11178,scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy electrochemical impedance spectroscopy cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry was used to characterize the nanostructure and performance of the sensor and the results were compared with those obtained at the multi walled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode and bare glassy carbon electrode
11179,under the optimized experimental conditions diclofenac sodium gave linear response over the range of moll
11180,the lower detection limits were found to be moll
11181,the effect of common interferences on the current response of ds was investigated
11182,the practical application of the modified electrode was demonstrated by measuring the concentration of diclofenac sodium in urine and pharmaceutical samples
11183,this revealed that the gold nanoparticle multiwalled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrode shows excellent analytical performance for the determination of diclofenac sodium in terms of a very low detection limit high sensitivity very good accuracy repeatability and reproducibility
11184,rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute pain with similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium
11185,diclofenac sodium is the most commonly prescribed nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug worldwide it is effective for the treatment of pain as well as the signs and symptoms associated with the painful conditions of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
11186,the aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a single dose of rofecoxib mg doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg and placebo over hour and hour periods in patients with moderate to severe pain after oral surgery
11187,in this double blind placebo and active comparator controlled parallel group study patients experiencing moderate to severe pain after the surgical extraction of or third molars were randomized to receive a single dose of rofecoxib mg doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg mg given every hours or placebo
11188,patients rated pain intensity pain relief and global assessments at prespecified times throughout the hour period after initial dosing
11189,overall analgesic efficacy was determined by total pain relief over hours topar and hours topar and patient global assessments at and hours
11190,onset of analgesic effect was determined by using the stopwatch method for confirmed perceptible pain relief
11191,peak analgesic effect was the maximum pain relief attained during the first hours
11192,the duration of analgesic effect was determined by median time to rescue analgesia use
11193,a total of patients were randomized to treatment received rofecoxib received diclofenac sodium and received placebo
11194,the baseline demographics were similar among the groups
11195,overall experienced moderate pain and experienced severe pain were female and the mean age was years
11196,the overall analgesic efficacy as assessed by topar of a single dose of rofecoxib mg was significantly greater than a single dose of enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg vs and placebo vs
11197,patient global assessment at hours was also significantly better for rofecoxib compared with enteric coated diclofenac sodium and placebo
11198,topar was significantly greater for a single dose of rofecoxib mg compared with doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg vs and placebo vs
11199,at hours the patient global assessment for rofecoxib was significantly better than that achieved with enteric coated diclofenac sodium and placebo
11200,the onset of analgesic effect was significantly more rapid for rofecoxib than for enteric coated diclofenac sodium and placebo median times minutes hours and hours respectively
11201,the peak analgesic effect was significantly greater for rofecoxib compared with enteric coated diclofenac sodium vs and placebo vs
11202,the duration of analgesia was significantly longer for rofecoxib than enteric coated diclofenac sodium median times hours vs hour and minutes and placebo hours vs hour and minutes
11203,enteric coated diclofenac sodium was numerically greater than placebo for the key end points measuring overall efficacy total pain relief and patient global assessment but diclofenac sodium did not provide as much analgesic effect as expected for a drug effective for pain osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and did not differ significantly from placebo
11204,overall both rofecoxib and enteric coated diclofenac sodium were generally well tolerated although the rofecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of clinical and drug related adverse events than the enteric coated diclofenac sodium group
11205,a single mg dose of rofecoxib provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over hours more rapid onset of analgesia greater maximum analgesic effect and longer duration of effect than a single mg dose of enteric coated diclofenac sodium in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with oral surgery
11206,compared with doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium mg mg every hours a single dose of rofecoxib mg provided greater overall analgesic efficacy over hours
11207,lymphocytes predominantly express delayed rectifier k channels kv in their plasma membranes and the channels play crucial roles in the lymphocyte activation and proliferation
11208,since nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drugs exert immunomodulatory effects they would affect the channel currents in lymphocytes
11209,in the present study employing the standard patch clamp whole cell recording technique we examined the effects of diclofenac sodium salicylate and indomethacin on the channel currents in murine thymocytes and the membrane capacitance
11210,diclofenac sodium and salicylate significantly suppressed the pulse end currents of the channel
11211,however indomethacin suppressed both the peak and the pulse end currents with a significant increase in the membrane capacitance
11212,this study demonstrated for the first time that nsaids such as diclofenac sodium salicylate and indomethacin exert inhibitory effects on thymocyte kv channel currents
11213,the slow inactivation pattern induced by indomethacin was thought to be associated with microscopic changes in the plasma membrane surface detected by the increase in the membrane capacitance
11214,this study is an evaluation of patients diagnosed with actinic keratosis ak lesions of the upper and lower lip both cutaneous and mucosal surfaces with at least one lesion on the vermilion mucosal lip
11215,patients were treated twice daily with a topical application of diclofenac sodium gel solaraze gel doak dermatologics for a period of days with a follow up assessment at days post treatment
11216,the presence or absence of target and new lesions was assessed and quantified at the initial baseline visit and at each follow up visit
11217,an investigator global improvement index score assessment and an evaluation of tolerability was also performed at each follow up visit
11218,the application of diclofenac sodium gel provides an effective approach for the treatment of ak of the lip
11219,the cure rate reported in this study for ak of the lip was similar to that of diclofenac sodium gel for ak on skin elsewhere on the body and has a low incidence of irritation and other adverse reactions as well as a high rate of patient satisfaction
11220,the unique safety and tolerability profile of diclofenac sodium gel would appear to lend itself well to treatment of the mucosal lip and vermilion particularly when treatment decisions involve cosmetic appearance during and subsequent to therapy
11221,ingenol mebutate ingmeb and diclofenac sodium ds are approved treatments for actinic keratosis ak
11222,to compare the efficacy and safety of ingmeb gel with ds gel nct
11223,patients with visible discrete ak lesions on the face scalp in a cm
11224,akclear at end of first treatment course was higher with ingmeb vs ds p
11225,akclear at end of last ingmeb course and week was higher than ds both p
11226,the most frequent ae was application site erythema ingmeb ds
11227,treatment related ae trae duration was shorter with ingmeb
11228,trae withdrawals were lower for ingmeb vs ds
11229,tsqm scores for global satisfaction p and effectiveness p were higher with ingmeb as was dosing instruction adherence vs
11230,akclear patient treatment satisfaction and effectiveness were significantly higher with ingmeb compared with ds demonstrating superiority of ingmeb for ak treatment on face scalp
11231,a prospective randomized clinical trial in preemptive analgesia for postoperative pain was conducted
11232,to compare the efficacy of three preemptive analgesics combined with local anesthesia continuous subcutaneous morphine sc continuous epidural morphine ed and diclofenac sodium ds
11233,systemic opioids are known to be effective methods of postoperative pain control
11234,the use of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia has been a standard treatment in spinal surgery
11235,only a few studies in the literature have investigated the efficacy of preemptive analgesia using morphine
11236,this is the first prospective randomized clinical trial to assess both subcutaneous and epidural continuous administration of opioids for preemptive analgesia
11237,for this study patients were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups sc ed or ds
11238,all patients underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion with instrumentation
11239,pain management was assessed using the visual analogue scale vas
11240,usage of supplemental analgesics the time to first request of them and side effects were also investigated
11241,twenty two patients were randomized to sc to ed and to ds
11242,no baseline variable differences among the three groups were seen
11243,the results showed no significant difference in analgesic effects among those three preemptive analgesics
11244,only immediately after surgery at hours the vas of the ds group was lowest among three groups
11245,but the ds group took more supplemental analgesic drugs until hours and the time to first request of this group was shorter than that of the other two groups
11246,high rates of minor side effects were seen in both the ed and ds groups
11247,sc gave moderate analgesic effects as well as the other two groups with few adverse effects
11248,ds provided a favorable effect immediately after surgery but the effective time was short and the patient needed more supplemental drugs after that
11249,ed did not give the expected effect with comparatively high rates of side effects
11250,continuous epidural anesthesia did not seem to be suitable for preemptive analgesia
11251,continuous subcutaneous morphine brought some analgesic effects with a low rate of complications
11252,it can be an attractive method for postoperative analgesia with technical ease
11253,a phase ii randomized double blind crossover study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of mg diclofenac sodium softgel formulated using prosorb technology with or without mg caffeine versus placebo in migraineurs during migraine attacks
11254,diclofenac has been demonstrated to be an effective migraine treatment in several placebo controlled studies
11255,a rapidly absorbed softgel of diclofenac has been shown to be effective in the rapid relief of acute pain and may have advantages in migraine treatment
11256,in addition caffeine has consistently been shown to increase both the efficacy and speed of onset of concurrently administered analgesics
11257,the ability of caffeine to both enhance and accelerate analgesic effects has been documented with a variety of different medications ie aspirin acetaminophen ibuprofen and ergotamine
11258,the period crossover study was designed to compare diclofenac softgel mg diclofenac softgel mg plus caffeine mg and placebo in the acute treatment of migraine
11259,subjects treated one moderate or severe attack with each study medication
11260,the primary efficacy parameter was the percentage of subjects with headache relief at minutes as defined by a reduction of headache severity from moderate or severe at baseline to absent or mild compared with placebo
11261,though the sample size estimate required that subjects treat separate attacks subjects treated migraine attack treated attacks and treated attacks
11262,results in the placebo group of subjects reported headache relief at minutes versus of subjects in the diclofenac softgel group and of subjects in the diclofenac softgel plus caffeine group
11263,differences were statistically significant for the diclofenac softgel plus caffeine group versus placebo odds ratio confidence interval to
11264,rescue medication was used by of subjects treated with placebo of subjects treated with diclofenac softgel and of subjects treated with diclofenac softgel plus caffeine
11265,this result is highly statistically significant chi p
11266,both the diclofenac plus caffeine p and diclofenac only p groups were significantly different from the placebo group in terms of the visual analog scale score at minutes
11267,the major finding of the present study is that diclofenac softgel plus caffeine produces statistically significant benefits relative to placebo at minutes
11268,diclofenac softgel alone did not differ significantly from placebo perhaps due to limits in sample size
11269,nonsignificant trends support the analgesic adjuvant benefit of caffeine when added to diclofenac softgels

11344,tdiclo appears to be well tolerated for the treatment of osteoarthritis in persons aged years or older
11345,interferon alpha ifn alpha administration induces major depression in a significant number of patients undergoing treatment for viral illnesses and other chronic diseases
11346,non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are known to counteract a number of ifn alpha induced side effects including pro inflammatory cytokine activation and stress hormone release
11347,to investigate this possibility further we sought to determine the effect of the nsaid diclofenac sodium on monoamine turnover in brain induced by acute ifn alpha exposure
11348,eleven male wistar rats weeks old were pretreated with diclofenac mg kg s c or saline followed by intracerebroventricular i c v
11349,infusion of ifn alpha iu in microl or vehicle
11350,the prefrontal cortex striatum and hippocampus were isolated and samples were assayed for monoamines and major metabolites by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection
11351,the data show that acute ifn alpha increased serotonin turnover in prefrontal cortex and increased dopamine turnover in hippocampus while pre treatment with diclofenac completely prevented these neurochemical responses
11352,importantly these changes were recorded in two brain areas known to be important in depression and antidepressant action
11353,these data offer support for a novel role of nsaids in modulating ifn alpha induced neurochemical alterations and raise the possibility of the use of nsaids for the prevention of ifn alpha induced depression
11354,we aimed to compare the effect of dexamethasone mg and diclofenac sodium mg associated with codeine mg on the control of pain swelling and trismus after extraction of impacted third molars
11355,fifteen healthy patients with a mean age of years sd years received a single oral dose of either drug hour before each surgical procedure left and right teeth
11356,at and hours after surgery swelling was determined by use of linear measurements on the face and trismus was determined by maximal mouth opening

11358,data analysis involved descriptive statistics and shapiro wilk wilcoxon and paired t tests p
11359,dexamethasone controlled pain p and edema p within hours better than diclofenac sodium associated with codeine
11360,no statistically significant differences were found between drugs regarding trismus and consumption of rescue analgesics acetaminophen
11361,the results of this study suggest that pre emptive administration of dexamethasone mg showed better control of pain and swelling in bilateral extractions of third impacted mandibular molars
11362,effect of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid on blood pressure bp control was evaluated in elderly hypertensive patients treated with calcium antagonist
11363,the study was based on a randomized crossover design to compare the effect of an nsaid sulindac with that of another nsaid diclofenac sodium in the hypertension treatment
11364,the study was completed in six elderly female subjects the average age year whose systolic bp and diastolic bp were more than mmhg and more than mmhg respectively
11365,when bp was controlled by nifedipine mg x per day in slow releasing form within normal limits sulindac mg x per day or diclofenac sodium mg x per day was administered for a week
11366,after one week washout period the other nsaid was substituted
11367,plasma and urinary variables were measured on the final day of each study period
11368,the average systolic bp and diastolic bp and the entry of study were mmhg and mmhg respectively
11369,nifedipine significantly decreased the systolic bp to mmhg p less than and the diastolic bp to mmhg p less than
11370,addition of either sulindac or diclofenac sodium did not affect bp whereas urinary pge excretion and plasma renin activity were significantly inhibited
11371,plasma creatinine and electrolyte concentration were not changed by the nsaids
11372,the results indicate that either sulindac or diclofenac sodium does not interfere with control of hypertension by a calcium antagonist nifedipine in in elderly hypertensive patients
11373,abstract truncated at words
11374,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are standard therapy for osteoarthritis oa
11375,topically applied nsaids reduce systemic exposure compared with oral nsaids and european guidelines recommend their use
11376,the nsaid diclofenac is available in a range of topical formulations
11377,diclofenac gel and four times daily and twice daily bid solutions are approved to reduce pain from oa of the knee s
11378,the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of diclofenac sodium topical solution bid versus vehicle control solution for treating pain associated with oa of the knee
11379,a phase ii week randomized double blind parallel group two arm vehicle controlled study compared pain relief with diclofenac sodium topical solution versus control vehicle only in patients aged to years with radiographically confirmed primary oa of the knee
11380,clinicaltrials gov identifier nct
11381,the primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline to the final visit in the western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index womac pain subscale
11382,secondary outcomes included additional womac subscales and patient global assessment of oa
11383,treatment emergent adverse events teaes skin irritation and vital signs were assessed and collected throughout the study
11384,of patients randomized received dose of study drug
11385,significantly greater reductions in least squares mean standard error womac pain scores were observed for diclofenac treated versus vehicle treated patients at the final visit p
11386,the most commonly reported teaes were administration site conditions
11387,the vehicle treated group experienced slightly more teaes than the active treatment group vs
11388,no serious adverse events were reported
11389,administration of diclofenac sodium topical solution bid resulted in significantly greater improvement in pain reduction in patients with oa of the knee versus vehicle control and was generally well tolerated
11390,diclofenac sodium a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug widely used in both human and veterinary medicine has been detected in aquatic environments therefore its ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms need to be clarified
11391,recently toxicity testing using zebrafish danio rerio embryos has been recommended from the point of view of animal welfare therefore we investigated the suitability of using sub lethal endpoints observed during embryogenesis for predicting lethal effects in early life stage zebrafish exposed to diclofenac sodium
11392,after exposure to diclofenac sodium mg l from hours post fertilization to days post hatching abnormal embryogenesis characterized by the presence of edema and body curvature was observed in the mg l exposure group but not in any other groups including controls
11393,the body curvature was found to be the result of abnormal development of the spine
11394,all abnormal embryos hatched without delay but died within week after hatching suggesting that the combination of the sub lethal endpoints of edema and abnormal development of the spine during embryogenesis may predict lethal effects in early life stage zebrafish exposed to diclofenac sodium
11395,further investigations to verify these findings are needed
11396,the value of the no observed effect concentrations for the embryogenesis survival and growth endpoints were and mg l respectively
11397,a prospective double blinded placebo controlled randomized study was conducted in our institute to compare the efficacy of oral silodosin an alpha selective antagonist and diclofenac in relieving pain after stent removal
11398,all patients with unilateral stent placement following renal and ureteric stone endoscopic surgery were randomized into four groups group a placebo group b diclofenac group c silodosin and group d combination of diclofenac and silodosin
11399,visual analogue score vas score and other relevant parameters were assessed during opd visit
11400,patients were handed over randomized drug envelope and asked to take the medications one hour before the stent removal
11401,patients were contacted h after stent removal and relevant parameters were recorded
11402,the mean vas scores were significantly decreased in diclofenac silodosin and combination group when compared to placebo p
11403,however there was no statistically significant difference in vas scores between the treatment groups i e group b c and d p
11404,analgesics requirement and severe pain rates were not significantly reduced p in the three treatment groups when compared to placebo
11405,thus silodosin and diclofenac both are effective in preventing pain after stent removal
11406,the pharmacokinetic study of a diclofenac sodium capsule filled with enteric coated pellets abbreviated as capsule in healthy chinese subjects was evaluated using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with simple sample preparation
11407,in a cross over study healthy male volunteers were given mg capsule and diclofenac sodium enteric coated tablet abbreviated as tablet used as a control dosage form at fasting
11408,the cmax auc t and tmax of capsule were g ml g h ml and h respectively
11409,when compared with tablet the pharmacokinetic study showed that although this capsule exhibited similar auc only lower it presented lower maximum plasma concentration faster absorption and shorter time to reach maximum concentration
11410,when compared with the previous study in germany obvious variations on tmax were found in chinese subjects taking capsule but not tablet
11411,the results indicated that individual difference should be paid attention when prescribing capsule to chinese patients
11412,nonunion fractures and large bone defects are significant targets for osteochondral tissue engineering strategies
11413,a major hurdle in the use of these therapies is the foreign body response of the host
11414,herein we report the development of a bone tissue engineering scaffold with the ability to release anti inflammatory drugs in the hope of evading this response
11415,porous sintered scaffolds composed of poly d l lactic acid co glycolic acid plga and poly ethylene glycol peg were prepared with and without the anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium
11416,analysis of drug release over time demonstrated a profile suitable for the treatment of acute inflammation with of drug released over the first days and a subsequent release of around per day
11417,effect of drug release was monitored using an in vitro osteoblast inflammation model comprised of mouse primary calvarial osteoblasts stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines interleukin il tumor necrosis factor tnf and interferon ifn
11418,levels of inflammation were monitored by cell viability and cellular production of nitric oxide no and prostaglandin e pge
11419,the osteoblast inflammation model revealed that proinflammatory cytokine addition to the medium reduced cell viability to but the release of diclofenac sodium from scaffolds inhibited this effect with a final cell viability of
11420,however releasing diclofenac sodium at high concentrations had a toxic effect on the cells
11421,proinflammatory cytokine addition led to increased no and pge production diclofenac sodium releasing scaffolds inhibited no release by and pge production by when the scaffold was loaded with the optimal concentration of drug
11422,these observations demonstrate the potential use of plga peg scaffolds for localized delivery of anti inflammatory drugs in bone tissue engineering applications
11423,to investigate the extent and time course of pain intensity upon treatment with a topical diclofenac patch compared with placebo in acute traumatic sport injury based on a validated and established end point

11471,we evaluated the hydroxyl radical oh scavenging action of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids sodium salicylate sa diclofenac and celecoxib in fenton s reaction and their neuroprotective effects in methyl phenylpyridinium mpp induced striatal dopamine da depletion in rats
11472,salicylate hydroxylation procedure employing hplc electrochemistry was used to assay formation of oh in fenton s reaction in test tubes
11473,while sa dose and time dependently hydroxylated itself and inactivated oh celecoxib up to mm showed no effect on oh formation and diclofenac caused a reduction in oh generation only at high doses microm mm
11474,administration of the non selective cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor sa mg kg i p
11475,significantly attenuated striatal da depletion caused by intrastriatal infusion of mpp nmol in microl
11476,treatment with another nonselective reversible cox inhibitor diclofenac mg kg did not protect against mpp induced da depletion
11477,the selective cox inhibitor celecoxib mg kg treatment exacerbated mpp induced decrease in da
11478,failure of celecoxib or diclofenac to render protection in animals against mpp induced da depletion indicates absence of prostaglandin involvement in mpp action
11479,these results also suggest that the neuroprotective ability of sa is independent of prostaglandin mediation
11480,a relationship between inactivation of oh by sa and its ability to protect da depletion in the striatum caused by mpp indicates a direct involvement of oh in the action of this neurotoxin
11481,the present study establishes potent neuroprotective activity of sa and suggests the use of aspirin in adjuvant therapy in parkinson s disease

11511,treatment related application site dermatitis was more common with dsg compared with vehicle in both younger vs respectively and older vs respectively patients and was the main reason for the difference in treatment related aes between the dsg and vehicle groups
11512,gastrointestinal aes were infrequent among patients treated with dsg and similar to incidence rates with vehicle in both age groups
11513,dsg was effective and generally well tolerated in adults regardless of age
11514,these data support the topical application of dsg for relief of oa knee pain in elderly and younger patients

11516,the effects of half sized secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor or diclofenac sodium administered alone or in combination with the benzoxazinorifamycin krm on the therapeutic efficacy of krm against mycobacterium avium complex mac in mice were studied
11517,neither of the two anti inflammatory drugs affected the efficacy of krm while they exerted significant modulating effects on tumor necrosis factor alpha production by mac infected macrophages
11518,advantages and inconveniencies of transdermal systems regarding the advantages one notes the reduction or even suppression of the gastro intenstinal disorders related to the oral administration of non steroidal anti inflammatories nsaids the absence of first pass hepatic effect and the better control of the quantities administered of a strong acting drug
11519,regarding the inconveniencies one should bear in mind the impossibility of administering or the diffusion of high doses of irritant or sensitizing molecules on the skin
11520,a preparation for application on the skin must be both hydrophilic and lipophilic with great solubility in water and affinity for the lipids as is the case with diclofenac epolamine
11521,from an experimental point of view diclofenac epolamine has demonstrated a strong anti inflammatory effect in the rat or the rabbit with transfer following repeated local applications measurable concentrations in the plasma and adjacent tissues excellent general tolerance and the safety of the plaster
11522,various clinical trials have shown that the flector plaster is well tolerated and effective in the treatment of epicondylitis sprained ankles minor sport induced trauma and osteo arthrosis of the knee
11523,this article reviews topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid formulations available in the united states including advantages and disadvantages therapeutic usefulness adverse effects and formulation considerations
11524,in the united states several topical nsaid products are approved to treat painful conditions including diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel endo pharmaceuticals diclofenac sodium topical solution w w in dimethyl sulfoxide pennsaid mallinckrodt inc and diclofenac epolamine flector patch alpharma pharmaceuticals llc a subsidiary of pfizer inc
11525,recent studies suggest topical diclofenac preparations are effective for osteoarthritis pain and suggest the efficacy of topical formulations is similar to that achieved with oral nsaid formulations
11526,all nsaid formulations contain the same boxed warnings regarding cardiovascular and renal toxicity however topical nsaids are proposed to have a more favorable safety profile than oral nsaids due to the low serum concentrations achieved with topical nsaid formulations
11527,topical nsaids have been shown to be beneficial from both a therapeutics and adverse effect perspective and are increasingly recommended in treatment guidelines
11528,this review focuses on previously unpublished clinical and pharmacokinetic data with the diclofenac epolamine diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine patch supporting the hypothesis of a topical effect of this formulation
11529,previous studies have shown that or weeks of treatment with diclofenac epolamine provides pain relief for various localized musculoskeletal conditions such as ankle sprains epicondylitis and knee osteoarthritis
11530,the reduction in pain after application of the first patch in patients with painful knee osteoarthritis was significant at the hour time point and was superior to placebo at the hour time point and at all time points thereafter
11531,comparable results were found in a study of patients with acute ankle sprains in which pain relief was also significantly superior to placebo at the hour time point
11532,corresponding single dose patch application for hours in ten healthy volunteers demonstrated that diclofenac first appears in plasma at a mean of hours after application range hours
11533,hence the patch provided pain relief at a time point at which no diclofenac is assumed to be in plasma which demonstrates local action in terms of tissue diclofenac accumulation under the patch
11534,this is further supported by an apparent plasma diclofenac half life of hours after patch application which implies the presence of a tissue reservoir as the half life after oral intake of diclofenac is hours steady state plasma diclofenac concentrations are present before days application two patches day and are in the order of ng ml
11535,the bioavailability in terms of systemic exposure from the patch compared with oral intake mg day is in the order of
11536,such low diclofenac concentrations are without systemic effects as demonstrated by the fact that no drug related gastrointestinal bleeding ulcers or cutaneous events characteristic of steven johnson syndrome have been reported during years of diclofenac epolamine patch use these data provide support for the notion that diclofenac epolamine patch provides pain relief through accumulation of diclofenac under the site of application without any evidence of systemic effects
11537,study of healthy volunteers this double blind study bioadhesive plaster of diclofenac epolamine versus placebo showed that the application of diclofenac epolamine for hours induced a selective hypoanalgesic effect on the muscle proportional to the degree of hypersensitivity to the pain observed in baseline conditions
11538,the enhanced effect on the hyperalgic muscle can be explained by the direct impact of the active ingredient on the nociceptors and or its inhibiting effect on the local production of prostaglandins
11539,study of patients suffering from bilateral osteo arthritis of the knee in a hour trial of the treatment bioadhesive plaster impregnated with diclofenac epolamine flector plaster versus placebo the active treatment had a significant impact on the spontaneous pain during rest that was enhanced during mouvement
11540,in a longer term trial hours the regression of the spontaneous pain on the visual analog scale appeared even more significant still lasting hours after withdrawal of the plaster not only at rest but also on mouvement
11541,capsular contracture constitutes the main postoperative complication after breast augmentation by implant placement
11542,to date no systemic treatment known allows for improvement that does not simultaneously put the patient at risk for secondary complications of a more general nature
11543,flector tissugel is the sole locally active antiinflammatory patch
11544,its durable local antiinflammatory effect is associated only with a risk for rare and highly limited side effects
11545,after approximately weeks of treatment a high frequency of change from capsular contracture baker or to baker occurs provided the application was started no later than months after the onset of capsular contracture
11546,acute pain caused by musculoskeletal disorders is very common and has a significant negative impact on quality of life and societal costs
11547,many types of acute pain have been managed with traditional oral non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors coxibs
11548,data from prospective randomised controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicate that use of oral traditional nsaids and coxibs is associated with an elevated risk of developing gastrointestinal renovascular and or cardiovascular adverse events aes
11549,increasing awareness of the aes associated with nsaid therapy including coxibs has led many physicians and patients to reconsider use of these drugs and look for alternative treatment options
11550,treatment with nsaids via the topical route of administration has been shown to provide clinically effective analgesia at the site of application while minimising systemic absorption
11551,the anti inflammatory and analgesic potency of the traditional oral nsaid diclofenac along with its physicochemical properties makes it well suited for topical delivery
11552,several topical formulations of diclofenac have been developed
11553,a topical patch containing diclofenac epolamine detp flector patch approved for use in europe in has recently been approved for use in the united states and is indicated for the treatment of acute pain caused by minor strains sprains and contusions
11554,in this article we review the available clinical trial data for this product in the treatment of pain caused by soft tissue injury
11555,this study compared the pharmacokinetic profile and systemic and local absorption of diclofenac following dermal patch application and oral administration in yorkshire landrace pigs
11556,twelve anesthetized female yorkshire landrace pigs were randomized to receive either the dermal patch flector patch cm alpharma pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of pfizer inc new york ny or mg oral diclofenac voltaren novartis east hanover nj
11557,tissue skin area of cm and underlying muscles approximately cm in depth and blood ml samples were collected at timed intervals up to hours after initial patch application or oral administration
11558,the concentrations of diclofenac in plasma skin and muscle samples were analyzed using validated ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric methods
11559,peak systemic exposure of diclofenac was very low by dermal application compared with oral administration maximum concentration c max values of vs ng ml respectively
11560,absorption of diclofenac into underlying muscles beneath the dermal patch was sustained and followed apparently zero order kinetics with the skin serving as a depot with elevated concentrations of diclofenac
11561,concentrations of diclofenac in muscles beneath the patch application site were similar to corresponding tissues after oral administration c max values of and ng ml respectively
11562,in contrast to the wide tissue distribution of diclofenac after oral administration dermal patch application resulted in high concentrations of diclofenac only on the treated skin and immediate tissue underneath the patch
11563,low concentrations of diclofenac were observed in the skin and muscles collected from untreated areas contralateral to the site of dermal patch application
11564,dermal patch application resulted in low systemic absorption and high tissue penetration of diclofenac compared with oral administration
11565,topical analgesic drugs are used for a variety of painful conditions
11566,some are acute typically strains or sprains tendinopathy or muscle aches
11567,others are chronic typically osteoarthritis of hand or knee or neuropathic pain
11568,to provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of topical analgesics primarily nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids salicylate rubefacients capsaicin and lidocaine applied to intact skin for the treatment of acute and chronic pain in adults
11569,we identified systematic reviews in acute and chronic pain published to february in the cochrane database of systematic reviews the cochrane library
11570,the primary outcome was at least pain relief participant reported at an appropriate duration
11571,we extracted the number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome nnt for efficacy outcomes for each topical analgesic or formulation and the number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome nnh for adverse events
11572,we also extracted information on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events systemic and local adverse events and serious adverse events
11573,we required information from at least participants in at least two studies
11574,we judged that there was potential for publication bias if the addition of four studies of typical size participants with zero effect increased nnt compared with placebo to minimal clinical utility
11575,we extracted grade assessment in the original papers and made our own grade assessment
11576,thirteen cochrane reviews studies with around participants assessed the efficacy and harms from a range of topical analgesics applied to intact skin in a number of acute and chronic painful conditions
11577,reviews were overseen by several review groups and concentrated on evidence comparing topical analgesic with topical placebo comparisons of topical and oral analgesics were rare for at least pain relief we considered evidence was moderate or high quality for several therapies based on the underlying quality of studies and susceptibility to publication bias in acute musculoskeletal pain strains and sprains with assessment at about seven days therapies were diclofenac emulgel emulgel placebo studies participants nnt confidence interval to ketoprofen gel ketoprofen placebo studies participants nnt to piroxicam gel piroxicam placebo studies participants nnt to diclofenac flector plaster flector placebo studies participants nnt to and diclofenac other plaster diclofenac plaster placebo studies participants nnt to in chronic musculoskeletal pain mainly hand and knee osteoarthritis therapies were topical diclofenac preparations for less than six weeks diclofenac placebo studies participants nnt to ketoprofen over to weeks ketoprofen placebo studies participants nnt to and topical diclofenac preparations over to weeks diclofenac placebo studies participants nnt to
11578,in postherpetic neuralgia topical high concentration capsaicin had moderate quality evidence of limited efficacy capsaicin placebo studies participants nnt to we judged evidence of efficacy for other therapies as low or very low quality
11579,limited evidence of efficacy potentially subject to publication bias existed for topical preparations of ibuprofen gels and creams unspecified diclofenac formulations and diclofenac gel other than emulgel indomethacin and ketoprofen plaster in acute pain conditions and for salicylate rubefacients for chronic pain conditions
11580,evidence for other interventions other topical nsaids topical salicylate in acute pain conditions low concentration capsaicin lidocaine clonidine for neuropathic pain and herbal remedies for any condition was very low quality and typically limited to single studies or comparisons with sparse data we assessed the evidence on withdrawals as moderate or very low quality because of small numbers of events
11581,in chronic pain conditions lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with topical diclofenac than placebo studies participants number needed to treat to prevent nntp moderate quality evidence and topical salicylate vs for placebo studies participants nntp very low quality evidence
11582,adverse event withdrawals were higher with topical capsaicin low concentration than placebo studies participants nnh very low quality evidence topical salicylate vs for placebo studies participants nnh very low quality evidence and topical diclofenac vs for placebo studies participants nnh very low quality evidence in acute pain systemic or local adverse event rates with topical nsaids were no greater than with topical placebo studies participants high quality evidence
11583,in chronic pain local adverse events with topical capsaicin low concentration were higher than topical placebo studies participants number needed to treat for harm nnh high quality evidence
11584,moderate quality evidence indicated more local adverse events than placebo in chronic pain conditions with topical diclofenac nnh and local pain with topical capsaicin high concentration nnh
11585,there was moderate quality evidence of no additional local adverse events with topical ketoprofen over topical placebo in chronic pain
11586,serious adverse events were rare very low quality evidence grade assessments of moderate or low quality in some of the reviews were considered by us to be very low because of small numbers of participants and events
11587,there is good evidence that some formulations of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are useful in acute pain conditions such as sprains or strains with low good nnt values
11588,there is a strong message that the exact formulation used is critically important in acute conditions and that might also apply to other pain conditions
11589,in chronic musculoskeletal conditions with assessments over to weeks topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in hand and knee osteoarthritis as did topical high concentration capsaicin in postherpetic neuralgia
11590,though nnts were higher this still indicates that a small proportion of people had good pain relief use of grade in cochrane reviews with small numbers of participants and events requires attention
11591,topical formulations of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in particular diclofenac di have become popular for treating various acute and chronic painful inflammatory conditions
11592,to perform a literature review of the use of topical nsaids the pharmaceutical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a medicated plaster patch containing diclofenac epolamine di ep flector tissugel flector patch compared with other formulations of topical nsaids and evaluation of the clinical findings from studies with this novel di ep patch
11593,pharmacokinetic studies involved determination of di from di ep and separately epolamine ep and the epoxide metabolite n oxide ep in laboratory animals and humans the latter being the major metabolite in humans
11594,about of di is absorbed by the skin in humans and is excreted in the urine
11595,maximum plasma concentrations of ng ml di are reached at hours approximate steady state conditions the plasma elimination half time t being hours
11596,low systemic levels of di and ep are produced from di ep
11597,pronounced accumulation of di occurs in the muscle layers and in synovial fluids of arthritic patients no significant toxicity occurs from ep nor n oxide ep while that of oral di ep was similar to that from di and in acute musculoskeletal conditions sprains tendonitis and sports injuries and osteoarthritis di ep patches control pain and signs of joint or physical injury compared with placebo controls by days with almost complete pain relief at days
11598,di ep was shown to have equivalent therapeutic effect to another di diethylammonium gel formulation voltaren emulgel
11599,there were no reports of serious adverse events in the gastro intestinal gi tract kidneys or liver from di ep
11600,mild gi symptoms and skin reactions occur in and of patients respectively
11601,the patch delivery of di in di ep affords controlled delivery of the active drug in contrast to that from application of gels or ointments of nsaids
11602,use of topical nsaids to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events
11603,this review is an update of topical nsaids for acute pain in adults originally published in issue
11604,to determine the efficacy and safety of topically applied nsaids in acute musculoskeletal pain in adults
11605,we searched the cochrane register of studies online medline and embase to february we sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers websites
11606,for the earlier review we also searched our own in house database and contacted manufacturers
11607,we included randomised double blind active or placebo inert carrier controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with acute pain resulting from strains sprains or sports or overuse type injuries twisted ankle for instance
11608,there had to be at least participants in each treatment arm with application of treatment at least once daily
11609,two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data
11610,we used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate the risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome nnt or additional harmful outcome nnh compared with placebo or other active treatment
11611,we reported confidence intervals ci
11612,we were particularly interested to compare different formulations gel cream plaster of individual nsaids
11613,for this update we added new included studies participants and excluded four studies
11614,we also identified additional reports of completed or ongoing studies that have not been published in full
11615,the earlier review included studies this update included studies
11616,most compared topical nsaids in the form of a gel spray or cream with a similar topical placebo participants were treated with a topical nsaid with placebo and with an oral nsaid
11617,this was a increase in the number of included participants over the previous version of this review
11618,we also identified a number of studies in clinical trial registries with unavailable results amounting to about participants for efficacy and for adverse events formulations of topical diclofenac ibuprofen ketoprofen piroxicam and indomethacin demonstrated significantly higher rates of clinical success more participants with at least pain relief than matching topical placebo moderate or high quality data
11619,benzydamine did not
11620,three drug and formulation combinations had nnts for clinical success below for diclofenac the emulgel formulation had the lowest nnt of ci to in two studies using at least pain intensity reduction as the outcome
11621,diclofenac plasters other than flector also had a low nnt of to based on good or excellent responses in some studies
11622,ketoprofen gel had an nnt of to from five studies in the s some with less well defined outcomes
11623,ibuprofen gel had an nnt of to from two studies with outcomes of marked improvement or complete remission
11624,all other drug and formulation combinations had nnt values above indicating lesser efficacy there were insufficient data to compare reliably individual topical nsaids with each other or the same oral nsaid local skin reactions were generally mild and transient and did not differ from placebo high quality data
11625,there were very few systemic adverse events high quality data or withdrawals due to adverse events low quality data
11626,topical nsaids provided good levels of pain relief in acute conditions such as sprains strains and overuse injuries probably similar to that provided by oral nsaids
11627,gel formulations of diclofenac as emugel ibuprofen and ketoprofen and some diclofenac patches provided the best effects
11628,adverse events were usually minimal since the last version of this review the new included studies have provided additional information
11629,in particular information on topical diclofenac is greatly expanded
11630,the present review supports the previous review in concluding that topical nsaids are effective in providing pain relief and goes further to demonstrate that certain formulations mainly gel formulations of diclofenac ibuprofen and ketoprofen provide the best results
11631,large amounts of unpublished data have been identified and this could influence results in updates of this review
11632,microemulsion me and poloxamer microemulsion based gel pmbg were developed and optimized to enhance transport of diclofenac epolamine de into the skin forming in skin drug depot for sustained transdermal delivery of drug
11633,d optimal mixture experimental design was applied to optimize me that contains maximum amount of oil minimum globule size and optimum drug solubility
11634,three formulation variables the oil phase x capryol smix x a mixture of labrasol transcutol w w and water x were included in the design
11635,the systems were assessed for drug solubility globule size and light absorbance
11636,following optimization the values of formulation components x x and x were and respectively
11637,the optimized me and pmbg were assessed for ph drug content skin irritation stability studies and ex vivo transport in rat skin
11638,contrary to pmbg and flector gel the optimized me showed the highest cumulative amount of de permeated after h and the in vivo anti inflammatory efficacy in rat paw edema was sustained to h after removal of me applied to the skin confirming the formation of in skin drug depot
11639,our results proposed that topical me formulation containing higher fraction of oil solubilized drug could be promising for sustained transdermal delivery of drug
11640,diclofenac is a hydrophilic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid widely used in humans and animals
11641,there are limited published studies evaluating diclofenac s skin permeation following topical administration
11642,the aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the in vitro permeation of three different diclofenac containing formulations patch gel solution over hours
11643,these formulations were applied n per formulation to pig skin sandwiched between the two chambers in a static franz diffusion cell and aliquots from the receptor medium were sampled at pre defined time points
11644,an hplc method with uv detection was developed and validated with the aim of characterizing the transepidermal penetration in the in vitro system
11645,using this assay to determine the permeation parameters results at hours showed that the flector patch released the highest drug amount whereas a lower drug amount was delivered with the voltaren emulgel and the solution
11646,the commercial gel showed the highest flux microg cm h and the shortest lag time h
11647,based on these in vitro results using pig skin the transdermal patch resulted in a long lasting controlled release of diclofenac while the gel had the shortest lag time
11648,a medicated plaster containing diclofenac epolamine dhep and heparin has been recently proposed for the treatment of local trauma ie ankle sprains accompanied by a clinically significant edema and or hematoma formation based on the combined antiinflammatory hemorheologic and antiedema properties of diclofenac and heparin
11649,the aim of this study was therefore to compare the effects of a combined dhep heparin and dhep alone in clinical experimental models of microangiopathy in order to provide a pharmacologic rationale for association of diclofenac and heparin
11650,the microcirculation was evaluated by measuring cutaneous blood flow laser doppler and transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures tcpo and tcpco in healthy volunteers before and after producing microcirculatory models of microangiopathy the models were based on reactive hyperemia rh and on local histamine injection which both produce a significant increase in skin flux and alterations of tcpo and tcpco
11651,the area of the study was the distal medial leg treated with placebo dhep alone flector tissugel and dhep heparin flector tissugel heparin
11652,the plasters were applied before producing the microcirculatory models to evaluate the efficacy of dhep and dhep heparin in controlling and limiting vasodilatation and development of microangiopathy
11653,a significant increase in cutaneous flux was obtained with both models
11654,the application of dhep partially limited the increase in flux and in tcpco as well as the decrease in tcpo which were considered signs of microangiopathy but the combination dhep heparin was significantly more effective than dhep alone
11655,the inclusion of heparin in the plaster thus improved the control of the microcirculation achieved with diclofenac alone when an experimental model of venous arterial hyperemia and microangiopathy was used
11656,in conclusion dhep in association with heparin modulates microcirculatory changes better than dhep alone
11657,it should be interesting to investigate the product in comparable clinical conditions in which it may be useful to act pharmacologically both on inflammation and microcirculatory disturbances that delay the recovery of patients
11658,clinical trial
11659,the effects of protirelin tartrate trh t administration on chronic post stroke spasticity were studied in a multicentre trial study on the treatment of chronic post stroke spasticity centres involved
11660,patient evaluation included the quantification of muscular strength examined in proximal and distal areas muscular tone according to the ashworth scale reflex intensities using a graded scale daily autonomy was also considered according to the parkside behaviour rating scale pbrs
11661,patients were administered mg of trh t twice daily by intramuscular route
11662,the most interesting finding emerging from the trial was that trh t administration elicited at the same time a reduction of spasticity hypertonia and hyperreflexia together with an increase in muscular strength and improvement of daily activities
11663,the therapeutic profile of trh t therefore seems to be based on its unusual capacity of acting simultaneously on deficiency symptoms hyposthenia loss of dexterity and positive symptoms hypertonia hyperreflexia both of which are present in cases of post stroke spasticity
11664,electrophysiological findings
11665,by means of coded electrophysiological tests it is possible to explore specific compartments of the motorial and spinal network and consequently obtain activity profiles for each single substance capable of modifying its reactivity
11666,the h m ratio reciprocal ia inhibition and the activities of the renshaw circuit were not changed following trh t administration
11667,opposite findings were recorded with regard to the f wave according to whether the flector or extensor nucleus was explored the consequent hypothesis of trh t activity at the interneuron level was supported by the inhibition of the short head biceps reflex following administration of the drug
11668,abstract truncated at words
11669,the diclofenac epolamine topical patch detp was approved by the us food and drug administration in january for the treatment of soft tissue injuries such as strains sprains and contusions although it has been available for many years in countries worldwide
11670,the aim of this study was to review the efficacy and tolerability of the detp in relieving acute pain caused by soft tissue injuries
11671,the medline derwent drug file biosis and embase databases were searched for literature published between and october in any language using the terms diclofenac epolamine patch diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine patch and flector patch
11672,clinical studies of the efficacy and or tolerability of the detp in patients with acute pain due to soft tissue injuries or localized periarticular disorders were included
11673,efficacy studies that enrolled patients with other medical conditions were excluded except for reports that focused on tolerability which were included to supplement tolerability data
11674,the bibliographies of included studies were reviewed manually for relevant articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and the manufacturer was contacted for additional relevant postmarketing surveillance information and presentations from scientific meetings
11675,the search identified placebo controlled clinical studies active comparator controlled clinical study and open label comparator clinical study of the efficacy and tolerability of the detp in patients with soft tissue injuries
11676,three studies reported on tolerability
11677,primary analyses among the studies reported detp associated reductions in spontaneous pain from baseline assessed using a visual analog scale ranging from to on day and to on day the use of the detp was associated with significantly greater reductions in pain scores compared with a placebo patch studies on day vs p and day vs p and compared with diclofenac diethylammonium topical gel study on day vs p
11678,with the use of the detp median time to pain resolution was days less than with placebo vs days p
11679,the prevalences of adverse events across the studies were low and not significantly different from those with placebo
11680,the most commonly reported adverse events were cutaneous application site reactions pruritus rash and dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms nausea
11681,based on data from clinical studies and postmarketing experience the detp was associated with significant pain relief in patients with soft tissue injuries with good tolerability
11682,flector plaster is a new transdermal delivery system medicated with diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine salt an nsaid which seems to possess suitable physiochemical properties for easy release by the plaster matrix for percutaneous absorption
11683,the paper deals with local tolerability and pharmacokinetic percutaneous absorption studies carried out both on animals and on volunteers
11684,the results obtained in the safety studies demonstrate the absence of local skin reactions and of sensitization phenomena
11685,the kinetic evidence obtained at the steady state reveals a profile typical of a sustained release formulation able to maintain constant plasma levels of the drug up to the next application h
11686,the amount of drug bioavailable for targeting the sites of action is effectively lower than via the oral route however the estimated absorbed dose of mg per application appears to be adequate for the foreseen therapeutic use taking into account the great advantage in having no undesirable side effects
11687,in general sports ankle sprain is the most frequently reported ankle injury and can cause chronic lateral ankle pain and tenderness
11688,treatment with nsaids is preferred and several topical nsaid formulations are now available helping to avoid the systemic adverse events typically associated with oral preparations
11689,to compare the efficacy and tolerability of a newly developed fixed dose diclofenac epolamine diclofenac hydroxyethylpyrrolidine dhep heparin plaster flectoparin tissugel with that of a dhep flector ep tissugel or placebo plaster in the treatment of mild to moderate ankle sprain in adults
11690,this was a randomized double blind parallel group placebo controlled multicentre phase iii study conducted in the emergency medical centres of hospitals or private clinics in europe
11691,outpatients aged years who had suffered an acute ankle sprain o donoghue grade i or ii in severity with external lateral ligament involvement within the previous hours and had peri malleolar oedema were eligible for inclusion
11692,a total of patients were randomized to receive a dhep heparin iu n dhep n or placebo n plaster applied once daily to the injured ankle for a total of days
11693,the primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in pain on movement on day as measured by a visual analogue scale vas
11694,the dhep heparin plaster was associated with a significantly p greater mean reduction from baseline in pain on movement after days of treatment than the dhep plaster vs mm vas with each active treatment providing significantly p greater pain relief than placebo mm vas
11695,both dhep heparin and dhep were also effective in relieving other measures of pain with dhep heparin recipients experiencing significantly less daily pain while leaning on the injured limb than dhep recipients p
11696,in addition oedema was reduced to a significantly greater extent with dhep heparin than with placebo day only p
11697,the dhep heparin plaster and dhep plaster were both well tolerated with adverse event profiles similar to that of placebo
11698,local adverse events were infrequent and generally mild in severity and there were no systemic adverse effects
11699,the fixed dose dhep heparin plaster is effective and has advantages over the dhep plaster in relieving pain and possibly also swelling associated with mild to moderate acute ankle sprains with oedema in adults
11700,n hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine hep epolamine is a strong base used to salify organic acids of pharmaceutical interest in order to improve their solubility in water
11701,diclofenac hep flector is the first example of an epolamine salt of a drug
11702,in this study c hep was administered by oral route mg about microci subject to volunteers with the aim to investigate its plasma profile and to calculate the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters
11703,the experimental data correlated with a two compartment pharmacokinetic model
11704,total radioactivity in urine and faeces was also measured
11705,the radioactivity was excreted preferentially by the faecal route about of the dose administered in the h collection interval
11706,urinary excretion accounted for about of the dose and occurred very rapidly about of the dose was in the h collection interval
11707,metabolic investigations were carried out on urine samples
11708,tlc analysis with radioscan detector indicated a main radioactive zone accounting for about of the radioactivity in the plate
11709,after scraping off and purification of the radioactive areas the compound isolated met i was analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with electron impact ionization process
11710,the structure of the metabolite was postulated to be pyrrolidine n oxide
11711,to describe the localisation of synovitis and tenosynovitis of the hindfoot observed on magnetic resonance imaging mri in patients with chronic polyarthritis and to correlate the findings of physical examination and mri
11712,patients with chronic polyarthritis and one or two painful hindfoot were included
11713,on physical examination and on mri the tibio talar talo calcaneal and talo navicular and calcaneo cuboidal joints were adjudged to have or not synovitis and the tibialis anterior and posterior the peroneus longus and brevis the flector digitorum and hallucis longus tendons to have or not tenosynovitis
11714,criteria for synovitis and tenosynovitis were a high signal intensity on t weighted images a low signal intensity on t weighted images and enhancement after gd dtpa injection in the joint area and around the tendon respectively
11715,the correlation between the findings of physical examination and those of mri were evaluated using the kappa statistics
11716,patients three men nine women mean age of years s d
11717,with chronic polyarthritis rheumatoid arthritis ra nine ankylosing spondylitis one psoriatic arthritis one unclassified one were included
11718,all presented with one patients or two patients painful hindfeet and swelling for out of hindfeet
11719,on physical examination joints and eight tendons were adjudged to have synovitis and tenosynovitis
11720,mri showed synovitis in out of of these joints and tenosynovotis in three out of eight of these tendons
11721,moreover mri showed ten and seven clinically unsuspected synovitis and tenosynovitis respectively
11722,the proportion of agreements between physical examination and mri were kappa and kappa for synovitis and tenosynovitis respectively
11723,a weak correlation was observed between the findings of physical examination and mri in patients with chronic polyarthritis and a painful hindfoot
11724,mri might be used to localise synovitis in the area before performing some intra articular injections
11725,however other studies are needed to address this question
11726,lipitor is a cholesterol lowering drug and celebrex is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor
11727,we investigated the effects of lipitor and celebrex on human prostate cancer vcap cells cultured in vitro and grown as orthotopic xenograft tumors in scid mice
11728,apoptosis was measured by morphological assessment and caspase assay
11729,nuclear factor kappa b nf b activation was determined by luciferase reporter assay
11730,b cell lymphoma bcl was measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry
11731,orthotopic prostate tumors were monitored by the ivis imaging system
11732,the combination of lipitor and celebrex had stronger effects on the growth and apoptosis of vcap cells than did either drug alone
11733,the combination more potently inhibited activation of nf b and expression of bcl than either drug alone
11734,the growth of orthotopic vcap prostate tumors was strongly inhibited by treatment with the drug combination
11735,administration of lipitor and celebrex in combination may be an effective strategy for inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer
11736,a concise and convergent synthesis of the atorvastatin the best selling cardiovascular drug of all time is presented
11737,our approach is based on an ugi reaction which shortens the current synthetic route and is advantageous over the published syntheses
11738,phenformin s recently demonstrated efficacy in melanoma and gleevec s demonstrated anti proliferative action in chronic myeloid leukemia may lie within these drugs significant pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and structural homologies which are reviewed herein
11739,gleevec s success in turning a fatal leukemia into a manageable chronic disease has been trumpeted in medical economic political and social circles because it is considered the first successful targeted therapy
11740,investments have been immense in omics analyses and while in some cases they greatly helped the management of patients in others targeted therapies failed to achieve clinically stable recurrence free disease course or to substantially extend survival
11741,nevertheless protein kinase controlling approaches have persisted despite early warnings that the targeted genomics narrative is overblown
11742,experimental and clinical observations with phenformin suggest an alternative explanation for gleevec s mode of action
11743,using c guided precise flux measurements a comparative multiple cell line study demonstrated the drug s downstream impact on submolecular fatty acid processing metabolic events that occurred independent of gleevec s molecular target
11744,clinical observations that hyperlipidemia and diabetes are both reversed in mice and in patients taking gleevec support the drugs primary metabolic targets by biguanides and statins
11745,this is evident by structural data demonstrating that gleevec shows pyridine and phenyl guanidine homology with phenformin and identical phenylcarbamoyl structural and ligand binding homology with lipitor
11746,the misunderstood mechanism of action of gleevec is emblematic of the pervasive flawed reasoning that genomic analysis will lead to targeted personalized diagnosis and therapy
11747,the alternative perspective for gleevec s mode of action may turn oncotargets towards metabolic channel reaction architectures in leukemia and melanoma as well as in other cancers
11748,interactions of inflammatory cells with pancreatic cancer cells play crucial roles in pancreatic cancer however the dynamic changes of inflammatory cell populations in pancreatic cancerogensis and after chemotherapy have not been well eclucidated
11749,the combinational use of aspirin and atrovastatin lipitor have been widely prescribled for cardio cerebral vascular diseases mainly by regulation of inflammations and they have been also reported to have plausible anti tumor effects however their potential roles in pancreatic cancerogenesis and chemotherapeutic effects have been seldom investigated
11750,we scanned the dynamic changes of pan inflammatory cell populations in pancreatic cancerogensis and after chemotherapy and found the potential target cell populations
11751,then we tested the roles of aspirin and lipitor to regulate these inflammatory cell populations and their effects on pancreatic cancerogenesis and chemotherapeutic effects
11752,cancerogen dimethylbenzanthracene dmba was used to induce pancreatic cancerogenesis and subcatunous implantation of syngenic murine panc pancreatic cancer cells was adopted as well
11753,gemcitabine was used for chemotherapy
11754,the peripheral blood pancreatic lesions and tumor samples were harvested and analyzed to search for the potential target cell populations
11755,the roles of aspirin and lipitor to regulate these cell populations and their potential effects on pancreatic cancerogenesis and chemotherapeutic efficacy were investigated both in vitro and in vivo
11756,we found progressive accumulations of myeloid derived suppressor cells mdsc and m polarzied tumor associated macrophages m in pancreatic lesions accompanied with dynamic reducations of cytotoxic t cells ctl and helper t cells th in the progression of pancreatic cancerogenesis
11757,after gemcitabine treatment the mdsc significantly reduced however m soared up unexpectedly
11758,aspirin could significantly inhibit the mdsc and m to prevent pancreatic cancerogenesis and improve chemotherapeutic effects of gemcitabine however lipitor did not significantly affect mdsc instead it could promote m to attenuate the postive effects of aspirin and gemcitabine
11759,mdsc and m accumulate in progression of pancreatic cancerogenesis and gemcitabine can induce m
11760,aspirin could prevent pancreatic cancerogenesis and improve efficacy of gemcitabine partially by inhibiting mdsc and m however when used in combination lipitor could weaken the efficacy of aspirin and gemcitabine partially by promoting m
11761,to observe the clinical effect of acupuncture therapy combined with lipitor in the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia spleen deficiency and food stagnation type
11762,sixty primary hyperlipidemia patients spleen deficiency and food stagnation type were equally randomized into medication group and acupuncture plus medication group
11763,patients of both groups were treated by oral administration of lipitor mg tablet one tablet per day for weeks
11764,manual acupuncture stimulation was applied to baihui gv zhongwan cv and bilateral zusanli st sanyinjiao sp yin lingquan sp and fenglong st for min twice daily for weeks except the weekends
11765,serum total cholesterol tc triglyceride tg high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c were detected by using a full automatic biochemistry analyzer before and after the treatment
11766,the therapeutic effect was assessed according to the standards described in guide principles for clinical researches of new chinese herbal drugs
11767,after the treatment the levels of serum tc tg of the two groups were significantly decreased in comparison with pre treatment in the same one group p and the therapeutic effect of the acupuncture medication group was significantly superior to that of simple medication group in lowering serum tc tg and ldl c levels and heightening hdl c levels p
11768,of the two cases in the medication and acupuncture medication groups and were basically controlled in their blood lipid levels and had a marked improvement and were improved and and were invalid with the effective rates being and respectively
11769,acupuncture combined with administration of lipitor is effective in improving primary hyperlipidemia in patients which is superior to administration of simple lipitor
11770,in a world of ever increasing health care costs generic drugs represent a major opportunity to ensure access to essential medicines for people who otherwise would be unable to afford them
11771,however some clinicians and patients are still questioning the safety and effectiveness of generic formulations compared to the proprietary drugs necessitating further systematic research analyzing the generic drugs efficacy
11772,our objective was to compare the lipid lowering effects of generic and branded atorvastatin
11773,this cross sectional retrospective cohort study was conducted at the university of malaya medical centre from may until may we analyzed the lipid profiles total cholesterol ldl cholesterol hdl cholesterol triglycerides of patients before and at least months after switching them from proprietary atorvastatin lipitor
11774,patients were included in this study
11775,when comparing the median values we found no statistically significant differences wilcoxon signed rank test p between proprietary and generic atorvastatin in lowering total cholesterol mmol l pre transition vs mmol l post transition p ldl cholesterol mmol l vs mmol l p and triglycerides mmol l vs mmol l p
11776,while there was a statistically significant p difference in hdl cholesterol levels favouring proprietary atorvastatin the extent of this change mmol l vs mmol l was deemed not to be clinically relevant
11777,there was no statistically significant difference when analyzing the effects on various ethnic groups
11778,substituting proprietary atorvastatin for its generic formulation atorvastatin calcium does not result in a less effective management of hyperlipidemia
11779,our findings lend support to the approach of lowering health care costs by switching patients from branded drugs to their less expensive generic analogues
11780,atorvastatin calcium ac loaded nanoparticles nps of mean particle diameter nm and narrow distribution were prepared and characterized
11781,their in vivo pk as well as pd measures following oral administration in different dosage regimens in hyperlipidemic rats were evaluated
11782,the results revealed that the oral bioavailability of two selected ac nps formulations was and relative to lipitor
11783,however the treatment regimens were not superior in reducing serum total cholesterol tc low density lipoproteins ldl and triglycerides tg levels compared to lipitor
11784,moreover the ac nps treatments were associated with significant adverse effects observed biochemically and histologically
11785,these results were contradictory with those obtained from a previous study in which similarly formulated ac nps of mean particle diameter nm were found to be more safe and effective in reducing tc ldl and tg levels when administered to hyperlipiemic rats at reduced dosing frequency compared to daily dose of lipitor despite their lower oral bioavailability
11786,the discrepant correlation between pharmacokinetics pk and pharmacodynamics pd results was suggested to pertain to the different biodistribution profiles of ac nps depending on their sizes
11787,hereby we provide a simple approach of particle size modulation to enhance the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin
11788,to examine temporal and geographic associations between google queries for health information and healthcare utilization benchmarks
11789,retrospective longitudinal study
11790,using google trends and google insights for search data the search terms lipitor atorvastatin calcium pfizer ann arbor mi and simvastatin were evaluated for change over time and for association with lipitor revenues
11791,the relationship between query data and community based resource use per medicare beneficiary was assessed for us metropolitan areas
11792,google queries for lipitor significantly decreased from january through june and queries for simvastatin significantly increased p for both particularly after lipitor came off patent p for change in slope
11793,the mean number of google queries for lipitor correlated r with the percentage change in lipitor global revenues from to p
11794,query preference for lipitor over simvastatin was positively associated r with a community s use of medicare services
11795,for every increase in utilization of medicare services in a community there was a unit increase in the ratio of lipitor queries to simvastatin queries in that community p
11796,specific search engine queries for medical information correlate with pharmaceutical revenue and with overall healthcare utilization in a community
11797,this suggests that search query data can track community wide characteristics in healthcare utilization and have the potential for informing payers and policy makers regarding trends in utilization
11798,statins are a group of medicines that can help to lower the level of low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol bad cholesterol in the blood
11799,having a high level of ldl cholesterol is potentially dangerous as it can lead to a hardening and narrowing of arteries atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease cvd atorvastatin is one of the oldest member of the statin family and is used in the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cvd
11800,atorvastatin was first made in august and from to under the trade name lipitor atorvastatin became the world s best selling drug
11801,numerous analytical methodologies are available for the quantification of atorvastatin and its content in pharmaceutical preparations and in biological fluids
11802,atorvastatin lipitor pfizer is a safe and effective hydroxy methyl glutaryl coa hmg coa reductase inhibitor statin
11803,it is the most potent currently available statin in terms of lowering low density lipoprotein ldl and total cholesterol levels
11804,it was the first statin shown to lower triglycerides in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridaemia
11805,it has a good safety profile
11806,in common with other statins it has non lipid lowering effects including improving endothelial function antiproliferative actions on smooth muscle and reducing platelet aggregation
11807,it also has anti inflammatory effects and may reduce plasma glucose levels
11808,clinical trial evidence with this statin is currently limited
11809,it did slightly reduce events in the avert trial comparing patients receiving coronary angioplasty with those receiving high dose atorvastatin therapy and in the miracl study reduced ischemia in patients with acute coronary syndromes
11810,other end point trials are in progress
11811,to investigate the mechanism of the treatment of hyperlipidemia rats induced by huangqi san
11812,the male sd rats were randomly divided into normal group model group huangqi san low and high dose group g kg and positive lipitor group mg kg
11813,the normal group feeds on base feed and other groups feed on high fat feed
11814,after weeks the hyperlipidemia model was successful
11815,after intervention by drugs for weeks fasting blood glucose total cholesterol triglycerides and ldl cholesterol content of all rats were measured
11816,the pathological changes of liver and skeletal muscle of rats were observed in rats
11817,real time pcr and western blot were used to detect the mrna and protein expression levels of ampk signaling pathway in the liver and skeletal muscles ampk acc cpta srebp hmgcr
11818,the degree of fpg tc tg and ldl c were the highest in the model group and the liver and skeletal muscle pathology were the most obvious
11819,after intervention by huangqi san and lipitor a significant reduction in the blood sugar blood fat liver and skeletal muscle injury has improved significantly except srebf and hmgcr mrna and protein expression of this enzyme is reduced other ampk pathway related mrna and protein expression increased significantly
11820,huangqi san effect is superior to lipitor
11821,huangqi san may improve hyperlipidemia by regulating the ampk signaling pathway increasing the oxidation of fatty acids and inhibiting cholesterol synthesis
11822,although generic medications are approved based on bioequivalence with brand name medications there remains substantial concern regarding their clinical effectiveness and safety
11823,lipitor available as generic atorvastatin is one of the most commonly prescribed statins
11824,therefore we compared the effectiveness of generic atorvastatin products and lipitor
11825,we conducted a population based cohort study using propensity score matching to minimize potential confounding of patients years discharged alive after acute coronary syndrome acs hospitalization between and in ontario canada who were prescribed lipitor or generic atorvastatin within days of discharge
11826,the primary outcome was year death recurrent acs hospitalization
11827,secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure stroke new onset diabetes rhabdomyolysis and renal failure
11828,in the propensity matched pairs patients mean age was years were male had myocardial infarction and all patients had complete follow up
11829,at year of those prescribed generic atorvastatin and of those prescribed lipitor experienced death or recurrent acs hazard ratio ci p
11830,no significant differences in rates of secondary outcomes between groups were observed
11831,prespecified subgroup analyses by age sex diabetes atorvastatin dose or admission diagnosis found no outcome difference between groups
11832,among older adults discharged alive after acs hospitalization we found no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes or serious infrequent side effects in patients prescribed generic atorvastatin compared with those prescribed lipitor at year
11833,our findings support the use of generic atorvastatin in acs which could lead to substantial cost saving for patients and health care plans without diminishing population clinical effectiveness
11834,five prescribable statins are licensed in the uk atorvastatin lipitor fluvastatin lescol pravastatin lipostat or generic rosuvastatin crestor simvastatin zocor or generic or branded generic e g
11836,here we discuss the relative merits of different statins in addressing cardiovascular risk
11837,we have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury sci by lipitor atorvastatin at pre treatment
11838,though informative pre treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable
11839,therefore this study investigates the efficacy of at treatment post sci
11840,in a rat model of contusion sci resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis at treatment mg kg gavage was begun or h post sci followed by a once daily dose thereafter for weeks
11841,while the placebo vehicle vhc sci rats showed substantial functional deficit at sci animals exhibited significant functional recovery
11842,at diminished injury induced blood spinal cord barrier bscb dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin beta inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury
11843,bscb protection in at sci was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase mmp expression a central player in bscb disruption
11844,furthermore endothelial mmp expression was found to be rhoa rock pathway mediated and regulated by at through an isoprenoid dependent mechanism
11845,attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage
11846,significant reduction in axonal degeneration myelin degradation gliosis and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in at sci compared with vhc sci
11847,in summary this novel report presenting the efficacy of post injury at treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for sci
11848,the search for potent and efficacious inhibitors of the enzyme hmg coa reductase hmgri was the focus of considerable research in the s
11849,building on the discovery of the fungal metabolite derived inhibitors mevastatin lovastatin pravastatin and simvastatin a number of totally synthetic inhibitors were discovered and developed
11850,this manuscript describes the discovery and development of one of those synthetic inhibitors atovastatin calcium currently marketed in the united states as lipitor
11851,this inhibitor was designed based in part on molecular modeling comparisons of the structures of the fungal metabolites and other synthetically derived inhibitors
11852,in addition to development of the structure activity relationships which led to atorvastatin calcium another critical aspect of the development of this area was the parallel improvement in the chemistry required to prepare compounds of the increased synthetic complexity needed to potently inhibit this enzyme
11853,ultimately the development of several chiral syntheses of enantiomerically pure atorvastatin calcium was accomplished through a collaborative effort between discovery and development
11854,the impact of the progress of the required chemistry as well as external factors on internal decision making with regards to the development of atorvastatin calcium will be discussed
11855,coronary heart disease chd is the leading cause of mortality worldwide and high low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels have been shown to be key in the pathogenesis of this condition
11856,lipid control has therefore been the subject of decades of research and has led to many large and robust randomized controlled trials as well as the highest grossing drug of all time lipitor atorvastatin
11857,statin therapy has long been indicated for secondary and more recently primary prevention
11858,however despite the large scale use of statins chd prevalence remains high and some patients do not respond to statin therapy
11859,there has been a large push to find and test alternative lipid lowering agents these include fibrates cholesterol absorption inhibitors and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type pcsk inhibitors
11860,it is the aim of this review to assess the literature surrounding each of these groups of drugs
11861,saponins identified from fenugreek trigonella foenum graecum seeds are reported effective on dyslipidemia
11862,however the definite mechanism is still not elucidated systematically
11863,in this study we evaluate the effects of saponin extract on cholesterol absorption metabolism synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport in vivo
11864,saponin extract was prepared according to a craft established in our previous study
11865,after the establishment of dyslipidemia model male sprague dawley rats were divided into five groups namely the control group normal diet plus normal saline hfd group high fat diet plus normal saline lipitor group high fat diet plus lipitor mg kg and l m and h saponin groups high fat diet plus saponin in dosages of and mg kg respectively
11866,rats were sacrificed at the end of the th week after treatment
11867,biochemical characteristics of rats were tested histopathological sections of liver tissue were observed and the protein and mrna expression of related factors of cholesterol in the intestine and liver were determined
11868,one way anova test spss software version chicago il usa was used to determine statistically significant differences between the hfd and other groups
11869,in saponin groups the serum lipid bile acid efflux anti peroxide activities and lipid area of liver tissue improved
11870,cholesterol alpha hydroxylase and scavenger receptor class b type i elevated in the liver
11871,hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase levels were suppressed in both the serum and liver
11872,however significant cholesterol efflux was not found and niemann pick c like levels elevated in the intestine
11873,the mechanisms of saponin in fenugreek effect on ameliorating dyslipidemia are probably related to accelerated cholesterol metabolism inhibited cholesterol synthesis and facilitated reverse cholesterol transport but not cholesterol absorption
11874,in this work lyophilized poly caprolactone nanoparticles nps loaded with atorvastatin calcium ac were developed in an attempt to improve the in vivo performance of ac following oral administration
11875,the individual and combined effects of several formulation variables were previously investigated using step wise full factorial designs in order to produce optimized ac nps with predetermined characteristics including particle size drug loading capacity drug release profile and physical stability
11876,four optimized formulations were further subjected in this work to lyophilization to promote their long term physical stability and were fully characterized
11877,the pharmacodynamics pd pharmacokinetics pk properties of two optimized freeze dried ac nps formulations showing acceptable long term stability were determined and compared to a marketed ac immediate release tablet lipitor in albino rats
11878,pd results revealed that the two tested formulations were equally effective in reducing low density lipoproteins ldl and triglycerides tg levels when given in reduced doses compared to lipitor and showed no adverse effects
11879,pk results on the other hand revealed that the two freeze dried ac nps formulations were of significantly lower bioavailability compared to lipitor
11880,taken together the pd and pk results demonstrate that the improved efficacy obtained at reduced doses from the freeze dried ac nps could be due to increased concentration of ac in the liver rather than in the plasma
11882,ethyl r cyano hydroxybutanoate hn is an important chiral synthon for side chain of the cholesterol lowering drug atorvastatin lipitor which is the hydroxymethylglutaryl coa reductase inhibitor
11883,hn is also used as a synthon in the production of l carnitine and r amino hydroxybutanoic acid
11884,it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the synthesis process of hn for its extensive use
11885,this review gives an overview of different synthetic strategies of optically active hn including chemical and enzymatic approaches
11886,the emphasis is focused mainly on the synthetic routes using biocatalysts such as halohydrin dehalogenase nitrilase carbonyl reductase and lipase
11887,in the statin therapies for elevated lipid levels compared across doses to rosuvastatin stellar trial the efficacy of rosuvastatin calcium crestor was compared with that of atorvastatin lipitor simvastatin zocor and pravastatin pravachol for lowering plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c after weeks of treatment
11888,in this multicenter parallel group open label trial adults with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to treatments with rosuvastatin or mg atorvastatin or mg simvastatin or mg or pravastatin or mg efficacy and safety results from this trial have been previously published
11889,the additional analyses included in this report show that to of patients in the rosuvastatin to mg groups achieved ldl c levels mg dl mmol l compared with to of patients who received atorvastatin to of patients who received simvastatin and to of patients who received pravastatin
11890,other additional analyses showed that more patients in the rosuvastatin to mg groups than in the comparator groups who were at high risk of coronary heart disease according to national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel atp iii joint european societies or canadian guidelines achieved the ldl c goals of mg dl mmol l to compared with to mmol l mg dl to compared with to and mmol l mg dl to compared with to respectively
11891,results favoring rosuvastatin versus the comparators were also reported for patients a who had triglycerides or mg dl or mmol l and achieved both atp iii ldl c and non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c goals to versus to b overall who achieved the canadian ldl c goals of mg dl to mmol l mg dl to versus to and c who achieved all canadian goals for ldl c triglycerides mmol l mg dl to mmol l mg dl and the total cholesterol high density lipoproteincholesterol ratio to to versus to
11893,research has been carried on the feasibility of near infrared nir and raman spectroscopy as rapid screening methods to discriminate between genuine and counterfeits of the cholesterol lowering medicine lipitor
11894,classification based on partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da models appears to be successful for both spectroscopic techniques irrespective of whether atorvastatine or lovastatine has been used as the active pharmaceutical ingredient api
11895,the discriminative power of the nir model in particular largely relies on the spectral differences of the tablet matrix
11896,this is due to the relative large sample volume that is probed with nir and the strong spectroscopic activity of the excipients
11897,pls da models based on nir or raman spectra can also be applied to distinguish between atorvastatine and lovastatine as the api used in the counterfeits tested in this study
11898,a disadvantage of raman microscopy for this type of analysis is that it is primarily a surface technique
11899,as a consequence spectra of the coating and the tablet core might differ
11900,besides spectra may change with the position of the laser in case the sample is inhomogeneous
11901,however the robustness of the pls da models turned out to be sufficiently large to allow a reliable discrimination
11902,principal component analysis pca of the spectra revealed that the conditions at which tablets have been stored affect the nir data
11903,this effect is attributed to the adsorption of water from the atmosphere after unpacking from the blister
11904,it implies that storage conditions should be taken into account when the nir technique is used for discriminating purposes
11905,however in this study both models based on nir spectra and raman data enabled reliable discrimination between genuine and counterfeited lipitor tablets regardless of their storage conditions
11906,pfizer s atorvastatin lipitor is a blockbuster drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases
11907,in china a critical polymorph patent of this drug has been recently invalidated by the supreme people s court for insufficiency of disclosure
11908,here we discuss the particularities in patent litigation in china worth attention from the community
11909,to determine the effects of diet rats were placed on a standard diet fat or on a modified western high fat diet hfd diet fat at days of age doa and administered methylnitrosourea mnu at doa
11910,rats were administered effective tamoxifen vorozole and targretin or ineffective metformin and lipitor chemopreventive agents either by daily gavage or in the diet beginning at doa and continuing until sacrifice doa
11911,latency period of the tumors was determined by palpation and multiplicity and cancer weights per rat were determined at final sacrifice
11912,rats on the hfd versus standard diet had i a increase in final body weights ii significant decreases in tumor latency and iii significant increases in final tumor multiplicity and average tumor weight
11913,tamoxifen vorozole and targretin were highly effective preventive agents whereas lipitor and metformin were ineffective in rats on either diet
11914,serum was collected at doa and at sacrifice doa and metabolomics were determined to identify the metabolite changes due to diets and effective agents
11915,rats given the hfd had increased levels of saturated free fatty acids including myristate and decreased levels of aminooctanoate
11916,furthermore rats on the hfd diet had increased levels of aminobutyrate and decreases in glycine markers previously identified as indicators of prediabetes
11917,targretin increased long chain glycophospholipids e g oleyl linoleoyl glycerophosphocholine and decreased primary bile acids e g taurocholate
11918,tamoxifen increased palmitoyl linoleoyl glycophosphocholine and decreased stearoyl arachidonyl glycophosphocholine
11919,finally increased levels of methylated nucleotides methylcytidine and decreased levels of urea cycle metabolites n acetylcitrulline were associated with the presence of mammary cancers
11920,studies of alzheimer s disease suggest that neuroinflammation or deranged brain wound healing may be a cause of some cases
11921,but a placebo controlled study showed no effect at all on alzheimer s disease of low dose oral prednisone after one year
11922,introducing the steroid directly into the hippocampus and rhinencephalon via the nose as happens in hay fever subjects could be more effective
11923,in the present study we analyzed fda medwatch data for intranasal fluticasone propionate flonase to determine the frequency of alzheimer s disease as an adverse event reported after use of the medication
11924,machine readable data from medwatch including adverse drug reaction reports from manufacturers are part of a public database
11925,we used the online tool
11926,by september people reported side effects to medwatch after taking flonase
11927,among them people had dementia alzheimer s type
11928,by october people reported side effects after taking lipitor
11929,among them people had dementia alzheimer s type
11930,the lower incidence of alzheimer s dementia in the flonase group compared to the lipitor group was significant
11931,long term use of oral non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids is linked with reduced risk of developing alzheimer s disease
11932,data from medwatch suggest that fluticasone propionate administered intranasally might have a similar preventive effect to ibuprofen
11933,perhaps combining ibuprofen and flonase could be therapeutic
11934,further studies would be desirable
11935,for the last two decades we have seen remarkable growth in the pharmaceutical industry
11936,this growth has mainly been due to the approximately new blockbuster drugs such as lipitor atorvastatin and plavix clopidogrel
11937,more than half of the revenue of major pharmaceutical companies and above one third of the total pharmaceutical revenues came from the sales of these blockbuster drugs
11938,questions concerning the fate of these blockbuster drugs are beginning to surface as they are approaching their patent expiration dates and as they are expected to face significant competition from generic versions
11939,branded drugs with more than usd billion in sales as of are expected to lose their patent protection in the next to years while the less expensive generic versions are ready to enter the market
11940,it is plausible that a major paradigm shift in our thinking is needed to stay innovative competitive and economically feasible in this new era of drug development
11941,a new wave of innovations is expected to boost the blockbuster regime
11942,herein we discuss the different threats facing the branded monopoly as well as some of the hopeful expectations for the blockbuster drug
11943,the aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect of pleurotus eryngii cellulose on experimental fatty liver in rats
11944,rats were fed high fat fodder to establish a rat fatty liver model and were then fed different concentrations of pleurotus eryngii cellulose for six weeks
11945,lipitor was used as a positive control
11946,measured levels of alanine aminotransferase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast total cholesterol tc and total triglyceride tg the activity of malondialdehyde mda superoxide dismutase sod hepatic lipase hl and lipoprotein lipase and liver histopathological changes
11947,successfully established rat fatty liver model after feeding high fat fodder for one week
11948,a diet of p eryngii cellulose for six weeks significantly reduced alt ast tc and tg levels in rat serum p tc and ast levels in p eryngii cellulose high dose group and lipitor group were not significantly different from those of the control p
11949,sod activity increased significantly while mda and hl activity decreased p fatty degeneration and fat accumulation both decreased in hepatic tissue
11950,hepatic protection of p eryngii cellulose showed dose related effect
11951,p eryngii cellulose can affect lipid metabolism having therapeutic effects on fatty liver in rats
11952,to document the availability of selected pharmacy services and out of pocket cost of medication throughout a diverse county in michigan and to assess possible associations between availability of services and price of medication and characteristics of residents of the zip codes in which the pharmacies were located
11953,cross sectional telephone survey of pharmacies coupled with zip code level census data
11954,pharmacies throughout the zip codes of wayne county mi
11955,the out of pocket cost for a days supply of levothyroxine mcg and brand name atorvastatin lipitor pfizer mg availability of discount generic drug programs home delivery of medications hours of pharmacy operation and availability of pharmacy based immunization services
11956,census data aggregated at the zip code level included race annual household income age and number of residents per pharmacy
11957,the overall results per zip code showed that the average cost for levothyroxine was and for lipitor
11958,per zip code the mean sd percentages of pharmacies offering discount generic drug programs was home delivery of medications was and immunization for influenza was of pharmacies
11959,the mean sd hours of operation per pharmacy per zip code was zip codes with higher household income as well as higher percentage of residents being white had lower levothyroxine price greater percentage of pharmacies offering discount generic drug programs more hours of operation per week and more pharmacy based immunization services
11960,the cost of lipitor was not associated with any zip code characteristic
11961,disparities in the cost of generic levothyroxine the availability of services such as discount generic drug programs hours of operation and pharmacy based immunization services are evident based on race and household income within this diverse metropolitan county
11962,atorvastatin commercialized by the pharmaceutical companies parke davis and pfizer under the trade name lipitor is a new statin acting as a potent hypolipidaemic drug
11963,by inhibiting hmg coa reductase the key enzyme of cellular synthesis of cholesterol it increases the expression of ldl receptors and promotes the hepatic extraction of circulating ldl
11964,it has a more potent action than other available statins both on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels
11965,atorvastatin is indicated after diet failure in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia or combined hyperlipidaemia
11966,lipitor is available as tablets of and mg the usual doses is mg once a day to be increased up to mg day if necessary
11967,in rare severe cases the doses may be increased up to mg day
11968,asymmetric reduction of ethyl chloro oxobutyrate cobe by carbonyl reductases presents an efficient way to produce ethyl s chloro hydroxybutanoate s chbe an important chiral intermediate for the synthesis of hydroxymethylglutaryl coa reductase inhibitors such as lipitor
11969,previous research on direct to consumer advertising dtca has not focused exclusively on the african american population
11970,the purpose of this study was to explore african americans attitudes toward proactive health behaviors following exposure to dtca of atorvastatin calcium lipitor pfizer inc
11971,one hundred fifty african american patients participated in the study
11972,participants functional health literacy and health locus of control were assessed
11973,the participants were asked to view a dtca of lipitor followed by face to face interviews
11974,after watching the dtca of lipitor of participants agreed that they would talk to their physician about their cholesterol agreed that they would ask their physician to test their cholesterol level and agreed that they would ask their physician to write them a prescription for lipitor
11975,those who had a history of high cholesterol were more likely to agree to ask their physician to test their cholesterol levels
11976,low household income having public health insurance and prior experience with taking lipitor were significant positive predictors of patients agreeing to ask their physician to write a prescription of the advertised drug
11977,african american patients showed favorable attitudes toward proactive health behaviors after exposure to dtca of lipitor
11978,although much has been learned about the pathophysiologic process of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ttp both diagnostically and therapeutically since its initial description by moschcowitz in its etiology and treatments remain in many instances problematic
11979,thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura remains a rare entity whose etiology is usually unknown but several drugs and infections have now been implicated in its development i e
11980,cyclosporine a mitomycin c ticlopidine simvastatin lipitor plavix fk rapamune sirolimus hiv
11981,although its treatment by plasma exchange has gained worldwide acceptance since the late s the optimal exchange media is not known nor the volume and duration of exchange therapy nor appropriate salvage therapy ies
11982,without the benefit of randomized controlled trials its treatment to a large extent remains not evidence based but eminence based making the same mistakes with increasing confidence over an impressive number of years
11983,hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase hmgcr is the rate limiting enzyme of the mevalonic acid pathway and is required for cholesterol biosynthesis and the synthesis of coenzyme q coq
11984,statins inhibit hmgcr thus inhibiting the downstream products of this pathway including the biosynthesis of decaprenyl pyrophosphate that is critical for the synthesis of coenzyme q coq
11985,we show that zebrafish danio rerio larvae treated in tank water with atorvastatin atv lipitor exhibited movement alterations and reduced whole body tissue metabolism
11986,the atv inhibition of hmgcr function altered transcript abundance of muscle atrophy markers atrogen murf and the mitochondrial biogenesis marker pgc
11987,furthermore atv induced reduction in larval response to tactile stimuli was reversed with treatment of coq
11988,together the implication of our results contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of the statin induced damage in this model fish species
11989,atorvastatin is a second generation synthetic statin introduced in belgium in may its mechanism of action is similar to that of the other statins i e
11990,the inhibition of hmg co a reductase the key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis which leads to the increase of ldl receptors
11991,the prolonged half life h of atorvastatin and its active metabolites induces a prolonged inhibition of hmg co a reductase and a reduction of hepatitic apo b production
11992,the biological efficacy of atorvastatin is high to lowering of ldl depending of the dose
11993,atorvastatin is indicated in primary hypercholesterolemia mixed hyperlipidemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
11994,if necessary a resin or even a fibrate may be added
11995,the safety profile is good
11996,the most common adverse effects are gastro intestinal and transient
11997,liver tests or muscle enzymes are rarely modified
11998,if clinical proof of reduction of cv morbidity and mortality in primary and secondary prevention is obtained atorvastatin shall represent a major step forward in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia
11999,rh ii catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition of h azirines with n sulfonyl triazoles is disclosed in which a series of fully functionalized pyrroles is produced via rhodium azavinyl carbene intermediates
12000,a distinct feature of this reaction is that the azavinyl carbene serves as a c equivalent instead of as c or aza c synthons which have been reported previously in cyclopropanations and n cycloadditions
12001,moreover this methodology has also been successfully applied in the total synthesis of urb as well as the formal synthesis of atorvastatin lipitor
12002,hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for the development of coronary heart disease
12003,hmg coa reductase inhibitors have been used as first line drugs because of both their superior cholesterol lowering effect and reliable safety profile
12004,since there are many patients whose plasma cholesterol level does not reach the therapeutic target even if reductase inhibitors are available more effective drugs have been strongly required for a long time
12005,atorvastatin one of the most recently introduced statins produces greater plasma ldl cholesterol reductions than other statins
12006,this pronounced effect of atorvastatin seems to be due to its long lasting action presumably a reflection of longer residence time of atorvastatin and its active metabolites in the liver
12007,clinical trials of atorvastatin have also demonstrated marked plasma triglyceride reductions
12008,the triglyceride reduction with atorvastatin seems to stem from the following two indirect mechanisms limiting vldl secretion from the liver and increase in clearance of triglyceride rich lipoprotein via induced ldl receptors from plasma
12009,eleven clinical trials of atorvastatin which have been developed in japan clearly demonstrated its ability to reduce ldl c levels more strongly and in significantly more patients to ldl c treatment goals than other reductase inhibitors with similar safety profiles
12010,therefore atorvastatin adds a new dimension to the effective management of hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia
12011,atorvastatin at is a widely used lipid regulating drug to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides
12012,its poor aqueous solubility and hepatic metabolism require development of drug delivery systems able to improve its solubility and bypass hepatic effect
12013,for this purpose atorvastatin nanostructured lipid carriers at nlcs were prepared and characterized
12014,at nlcs were prepared by emulsification using high speed homogenization followed by ultrasonication
12015,the prepared nlcs showed particle size between and nm while zeta potential values varied between and mv
12016,they also showed high encapsulation efficiency and amorphous state of the drug in lipid matrix
12017,pharmacokinetic parameters of optimized formulation nlc composed of gelucire
12018,bexarotene targretin ligand pharmaceuticals inc is a synthetic retinoid analog with specific affinity for the retinoid x receptor and belongs to a group of compounds called rexinoids
12019,early clinical trials of this drug demonstrated activity in cutaneous t cell lymphoma
12020,subsequent phase ii iii trials have demonstrated a greater than response rate in patients with all stages of cutaneous t cell lymphoma who were refractory or intolerant to the previous therapy
12021,the principal toxicities of bexarotene include central hypothyroidism xeroderma and elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides
12022,these toxicities can be managed with dose attenuation or addition of atorvastatin lipitor pfizer or fenofibrate tricor abbott laboratories
12023,since bexarotene has little bone marrow toxicity it is an excellent candidate for combination therapy with other modalities useful in the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma
12024,these include ultraviolet b irradiation psoralen and ultraviolet a photochemotherapy interferons denileukin diftitox ontak ligand pharmaceuticals inc and cytotoxic chemotherapy
12025,bexarotene has also been investigated in the treatment of breast cancer and non small cell carcinoma of the lung with promising early results
12026,we describe a directed evolution approach that should find broad application in generating enzymes that meet predefined process design criteria
12027,it augments recombination based directed evolution by incorporating a strategy for statistical analysis of protein sequence activity relationships prosar
12028,this combination facilitates mutation oriented enzyme optimization by permitting the capture of additional information contained in the sequence activity data
12029,the method thus enables identification of beneficial mutations even in variants with reduced function
12030,we use this hybrid approach to evolve a bacterial halohydrin dehalogenase that improves the volumetric productivity of a cyanation process approximately fold
12031,this improvement was required to meet the practical design criteria for a commercially relevant biocatalytic process involved in the synthesis of a cholesterol lowering drug atorvastatin lipitor and was obtained by variants that had at least mutations
12032,cationic charged chitosan as stabilizer was evaluated in preparation of nanocrystals using probe sonication method
12033,the influence of cationic charge densities of chitosan low cs l medium cs m high cs h molecular weights and labrasol in solubility enhancement and modifying the release was investigated using atorvastatin atr as poorly soluble model drug
12034,compared to cs m and cs h low cationic charge of cs l acted as both electrostatic and steric stabilizer by significant size reduction to nm with charge of mev
12035,solubility of atr cs l increased to fold relative to pure atr and atr l nanocrystals were characterized for physiochemical properties
12036,scanning electron microscopy revealed scaffold like structures with high surface area
12037,x ray powder diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry revealed crystalline to slight amorphous state changes after cationic charge size reduction
12038,fourier transform infrared spectra indicated no potent drug excipient interactions
12039,the enhanced dissolution profile of atr cs l indicates that sustained release was achieved compared with atr l and lipitor
12040,anti hyperlipidemic performance was ph dependent where atr cs l exhibited fold higher efficacy at ph compared to ph and lipitor
12041,stability studies indicated marked changes in size and charge for atr l compared to atr cs l exemplifying importance of the stabilizer
12042,therefore nanocrystals developed with cs l as a stabilizer is a promising choice to enhance dissolution stability and in vivo efficacy of major biopharmaceutical classification system ii iv drugs
12043,studies have shown positive correlations between inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il and the development of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease by activating c reactive protein crp
12044,both atorvastatin calcium lipitor as well as flavonoid rich fruit such as tart cherry demonstrate potent anti inflammatory effects on il secretion
12045,in this study we investigated whether tart cherry extract or specific anthocyanins contained in the tart cherry show synergistic anti inflammatory effects with lipitor
12046,results showed that lps induced adipose stem cell secretion of il reduced with the addition of tart cherry extract a mixture of tart cherry anthocyanins and pure tart cherry cyanidin o glucoside cg in a dose dependent manner
12047,furthermore lipitor and cg exhibited synergistic effects in reducing lps induced il secretion from adipose stem cells
12048,in conclusion these results support potential benefits of using dietary phytochemicals in conjunction with pharmacological therapies to decrease adipose inflammation drug doses and ultimately drug induced adverse effects
12049,we combine experimental and computational determination of
12050,lipid metabolism dysregulation plays a crucial role in the occurrence of atherosclerosis as
12051,scap srebp signaling is the main pathway for regulating lipid metabolism
12052,tetramethylpyrazine tmp a traditional chinese medicine tcm for treating angina pectoris has antiatherosclerotic effects and ameliorates blood lipids disturbance
12053,however its precise mechanism remains unclear
12054,this study investigated the mechanism of tmp in ameliorating as in mice model
12055,after six weeks of high fat diet apoe
12056,the past years have seen a growing interest in cholesterol metabolism and its relationship to alzheimer s disease
12057,from the first report linking cholesterol and beta amyloid metabolisms to the recent positive report on the use of atorvastatin lipitor pfizer inc a cholesterol lowering drug in mild to moderate alzheimer s disease this review examines the scientific progress pertaining to etiopathology of alzheimer s disease over the past years and the central role of lipids in this field of research
12058,the role of key proteins involved in this metabolic pathway such as apolipoprotein e lipoprotein lipase caveolin hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase low density lipoprotein receptors cholesterol hydroxylase acyl coenzyme a cholesterol acyltransferase and beta amyloid are discussed
12060,pdz binding kinase pbk also named t lymphokine activated killer cell originated protein kinase topk a serine threonine kinase is tightly controlled in normal tissues but elevated in many tumors and functions in tumorigenesis and metastasis
12061,however the signaling that regulates expression of pbk in cancer cells remains elusive
12062,here we show that atorvastatin lipitor an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl co enzyme a hmg coa reductase that is a rate limiting enzyme of mevalonate pathway down regulates expression of pbk by impairing protein geranylgeranylation
12063,the shrna knockdown demonstrated that yes associated protein yap mediates geranylgeranylation regulated expression of pbk
12064,importantly atorvastatin or the geranylgeranyltransferase i inhibitor ggti inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation through inactivation of yap signaling and down regulation of pbk
12065,these findings have defined a new signaling pathway that regulated expression of pbk and identified pbk as a downstream target of the hippo yap signaling uncoverd a mechanism underlying the anti cancer effect by inhibition of mevalonate pathway and geranylgeranylation and provided a potential target for breast cancer targeted therapy
12066,in the world health organization estimated that over of cardiovascular disease in north america is due to both blood pressure and cholesterol higher than optimal
12067,unfortunately less than a third of patients with both conditions are identified and fewer than one in ten reach the treatment goals for both factors
12068,adherence to treatment is notably improved when therapy is initiated simultaneously
12069,combination therapy of amlodipine besylate norvasc pfizer ltd with atorvastatin calcium lipitor pfizer ltd marketed as caduet pfizer ltd is the first dual therapy compound designed to treat hypertension and or angina and dyslipidemia concurrently with a single daily pill in the full range of dosing combinations
12070,amlodipine atorvastatin retains the safety and efficacy of its parent compounds whilst simplifying the management of these comorbid conditions in what may be considered the first version of a polypill
12071,because k ras mutation and cyclooxygenase cox overexpression are hallmarks of majority of pancreatic cancer patients an approach to inhibit the progression and growth of pancreatic cancer using the simultaneous administration of agents that inhibit the function of both targets should be considered
12072,in the present study we assessed the effects of atorvastatin lipitor celecoxib celebrex and tipifarnib zarnestra on the growth of human pancreatic cancer
12073,in the in vitro studies we found that treatment of human pancreatic tumor cells with a combination of atorvastatin celecoxib and tipifarnib had a stronger inhibitory effect on growth and a stronger stimulatory effect on apoptosis than each drug alone or for any combination of two drugs
12074,we also found that treatment of panc cells with a combination of all three drugs strongly decreased the levels of phosphorylated erk and akt
12075,in an animal model of xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient scid mice we found that daily i p
12076,injections of a combination of atorvastatin celecoxib and tipifarnib had a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of the tumors in mice than each drug alone or for any combination of two drugs
12077,the results of our study indicate that a combination of atorvastatin celecoxib and tipifarnib may be an effective strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
12078,the inhibitors of hmg coa reductase statins are widely used as cholesterol lowering drugs with excellent safety records in hypercholesterolemic patients
12079,statins exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of cells and they were recently described as a new class of immune modulators
12080,depending on their structure dose and route of administration statins regulate the function of both the antigen presenting cells and t cells by hmg coa reductase dependent and independent mechanisms
12081,herein we describe these mechanisms leading to prevention amelioration and reversal of autoimmune diseases
12082,we also present data from our laboratories showing for the first time that in a double transgenic mouse model for autoimmune diabetes atorvastatin lipitor prevented the onset of disease when administered in the neonatal period and stabilized the glucose levels when administered in mice developing a mild form of diabetes
12083,recent advances in the development of both experimental and computational protein engineering tools have enabled a number of further successes in the development of biocatalysts ready for large scale applications
12084,key tools are first the targeting of libraries leading to far smaller but more useful libraries than in the past second the combination of structural mechanistic and sequence based knowledge often based on prior successful cases and third the advent of structurally based algorithms allowing the design of novel functions
12085,based on these tools a number of improved biocatalysts for pharmaceutical applications have been presented such as an r transaminase for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis of sitagliptin januvia and ketoreductases glucose dehydrogenases and haloalkane dehalogenases for the api synthesis toward atorvastatin lipitor and montelukast singulair
12086,to test if offering zero generic co pays for oral antidiabetic drugs oads and statins increases generic dispensing for low income subsidy lis recipients with diabetes enrolled in medicare part d
12087,we analyzed a natural experiment in which lis recipients were randomized to part d plans in some plans placed selected generic oads and statins on zero co pay tiers whereas others did not
12088,randomization eliminated selection effects which could bias the study findings
12089,we analyzed a random sample of medicare beneficiaries with diabetes from the chronic condition data warehouse using part d claims formulary provisions and co pay tiers together with a special file prepared by cms that identified all randomly assigned lis recipients in we calculated proportions using generic drugs in the classes and annual days supply among users in plans with and without zero co pay tiers for the country as a whole and california where zero co pay plans were particularly popular
12090,we found that the demand for generic oads was not significantly different in plans with and without zero co pay tiers
12091,by contrast a large difference was observed in the percent of lis recipients using generic statins in plans with zero co pay tiers vs p
12092,however the difference disappeared once we controlled for formulary restrictions on the most popular brand statin at the time lipitor
12093,this cautionary tale suggests that policy makers should give greater consideration to formulary provisions when evaluating the effects of free generics in value based insurance designs
12094,water insoluble drugs cannot be absorbed effectively through the gastrointestinal tract due to insufficient solubility and often face the problems of low bioavailability and poor therapeutic efficacy
12095,to overcome these biopharmaceutical challenges lipid based formulations were suggested and have been researched in recent years
12096,in this study we used atorvastatin as a model drug to prepare a phospholipid complex prodrug system to upgrade its lipophilicity and further developed a drug loaded submicron emulsion to improve its in vivo bioavailability
12097,the mean particle size and zeta potential of submicron emulsion were nm and mv
12098,intestinal absorption of atorvastatin from submicron emulsion was significantly improved compared with free drug and the absorption rate constant k
12099,epidemiological studies showed a strong association between alcoholism and incidence of stroke for which the underlying causative mechanisms remain to be understood
12100,here we found that infiltration of immune cells and deposition of cholesterol at the site of brain artery capillary injury induced atherosclerosis in chronic alcohol ethanol consumption in the presence or absence of high fat diet
12101,conversion of cholesterol into sharp edges of cholesterol crystals ccs in alcohol intake was key to activation of nlrp inflammasome induction of cerebral atherosclerosis and development of neuropathy around the atherosclerotic lesions
12102,the presence of alcohol was critical for the formation of ccs and development of the neuropathology
12103,thus we observed that alcohol consumption elevated the level of plasma cholesterol deposition and crystallization of cholesterol as well as activation of nlrp inflammasome
12104,this led to arteriole or capillary walls thickening and increase intracranial blood pressure
12105,distinct neuropathy around the atherosclerotic lesions indicated vascular inflammation as an initial cause of neuronal degeneration
12106,we demonstrated the molecular mechanisms of nlrp activation and downstream signaling cascade event in primary culture of human brain arterial capillary endothelial cells in the setting of dose time dependent effects of alcohol ccs using nlrp gene silencing technique
12107,we also detected ccs in blood samples from alcohol users which validated the clinical importance of the findings
12108,finally combined therapy of acetyl l carnitine and lipitor prevented deposition of cholesterol formation of ccs activation of nlrp thickening of vessel walls and elevation of intracranial blood pressure
12109,we conclude that alcohol induced accumulation and crystallization of cholesterol activates nlrp caspase in the cerebral vessel that leads to early development of atherosclerosis
12110,cholesterol lowering statin drugs are among the most frequently prescribed for reducing human blood cholesterol and they have been detected as contaminants in natural waters
12111,in this study the photochemical behavior of atorvastatin lipitor was investigated at two different concentrations of m mg l and nm g l using a solar simulator and a uv reactor
12112,photochemical fate in natural waters can be described in most cases by the sum of the loss due to hydrolysis direct photolysis and reaction with hydroxyl radical oh singlet oxygen o or o d and excited state dissolved organic matter dom
12113,the absolute bimolecular reaction rate constant with oh was measured using pulsed radiolysis m s
12114,the reaction rate constant of o was determined to be m s
12115,under the experimental conditions used at high atorvastatin concentration m the contribution of singlet oxygen o to the photodegradation of atorvastatin in natural waters was higher than that of hydroxyl radical and accounted for up to of the loss in aqueous solutions
12116,whereas at a concentration of nm o and oh both played a minor role in the removal of this compound
12117,lastly it also appears that atorvastatin reacts with dom contributing to its loss in simulated natural waters
12118,in animals cholesterol is made from carbon building blocks produced by the mevalonate pathway
12119,drugs that inhibit the mevalonate pathway such as atorvastatin lipitor have led to successful treatments for high cholesterol in humans
12120,another potential target for the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase mdd which catalyzes the phosphorylation of r mevalonate diphosphate followed by decarboxylation to yield isopentenyl pyrophosphate
12121,we recently discovered an mdd homolog mevalonate kinase mk from thermoplasma acidophilum which catalyzes the identical phosphorylation of r mevalonate but without concomitant decarboxylation
12122,thus mk catalyzes half the reaction of the decarboxylase allowing us to separate features of the active site that are required for decarboxylation from features required for phosphorylation
12123,here we determine the crystal structure of mk in the apo form and with bound substrates and compare it to mdd structures
12124,structural and mutagenic analysis reveals modifications that allow mk to bind mevalonate rather than mevalonate diphosphate
12125,comparison to homologous mdd structures show that both enzymes employ analogous arg or lys residues to catalyze phosphate transfer
12126,however an invariant active site asp lys pair of mdd previously thought to play a role in phosphorylation is missing in mk with no functional replacement
12127,thus we suggest that the invariant asp lys pair in mdd may be critical for decarboxylation rather than phosphorylation
12128,atorvastatin lipitor is an hmg coa reductase inhibitor with well documented lipid lowering effects
12129,it has recently been evaluated for the primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with type diabetes mellitus without elevated serum low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels
12130,atorvastatin mg daily for years was effective at reducing the risk of a first major cardiovascular event including stroke in a large placebo controlled multicentre trial in patients with type diabetes and at least one other coronary heart disease chd risk factor but without markedly elevated ldl cholesterol levels
12131,in this trial known as cards the collaborative atorvastatin diabetes study atorvastatin had a similar tolerability profile to that of placebo
12132,thus atorvastatin has a potential role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients at risk of chd irrespective of pre treatment ldl cholesterol levels
12133,to compare the patient characteristics and the inter temporal reporting patterns of adverse events aes for atorvastatin lipitor
12134,we identified clinically important aes associated with atorvastatin muscle pain and sibutramine cardiovascular aes compared their patterns in social media postings versus faers and used granger causality tests to assess whether social media postings were useful in forecasting faers reports
12135,we analyzed and social media postings between and and faers reports between and for atorvastatin and sibutramine respectively
12136,social media reporters were younger atorvastatin vs years p sibutramine vs years p
12137,social media reviews contained fewer serious aes atorvastatin pain vs sibutramine cardiovascular issues vs p for both and concentrated on fewer types of aes proportion comprising the top aes atorvastatin vs sibutramine vs compared with faers
12138,while social media sibutramine reviews mentioning cardiac issues helped predict those in faers months later p social media atorvastatin reviews did not help predict faers reports
12139,social media ae reporters were younger and focused on less serious and fewer types of aes than faers reporters
12140,the potential for social media to provide earlier indications of aes compared with faers is uncertain
12141,our findings highlight some of the promises and limitations of online social media versus conventional pharmacovigilance sources and the need for careful interpretation of the results
12143,pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety published by john wiley sons ltd
12144,atorvastatin lipitor is a lipid lowering agent that is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases
12145,previous research has largely focused on its cholesterol lowering effects however a limited number of studies have investigated the actions of atorvastatin on vascular endothelial cells
12146,in the present study the effects of various doses of atorvastatin were investigated on human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs
12147,huvecs were treated with various concentrations of atorvastatin in serum free or serum containing medium and alterations in huvec morphology were observed
12148,cell survival and necrosis rates were evaluated using sulforhodamine b and lactate dehydrogenase assays respectively
12149,in addition the protein expression levels of cellular apoptosis and autophagy markers were detected using western blot analysis
12150,the results revealed that huvec morphology was altered following treatment with various concentrations of atorvastatin
12151,in addition autophagy was demonstrated to be induced by atorvastatin treatment at all concentrations whereas high concentrations appeared to induce apoptosis and suppress the survival of huvecs
12152,in conclusion the results of the present study suggested that various doses of atorvastatin may exert differential effects on huvecs and high doses may suppress angiogenesis
12153,therefore atorvastatin may present a novel potential anti tumor therapeutic strategy
12154,however further studies are required to fully elucidate the association between the dose of atorvastatin and its clinical outcome
12155,a recent meta analysis demonstrates a robust but small association between weekly religious attendance and longer life
12156,however the practical significance of this finding remains controversial
12157,age specific actuarial death rates were modified according to published odds ratios to model the additional years of life attributable to weekly religious attendance regular physical exercise and statin type lipid lowering agents
12158,secondary analyses estimated the approximate cost for each additional year of life gained
12159,weekly attendance at religious services accounts for an additional to life years compared with to life years for physical exercise and to life years for statin type agents
12160,the approximate cost per life year gained was between dollars and dollars for regular exercise dollars and dollars for regular religious attendance and between dollars and dollars for statin type agents
12161,the real world practical significance of regular religious attendance is comparable to commonly recommended therapies and rough estimates even suggest that religious attendance may be more cost effective than statins
12162,religious attendance is not a mode of medical therapy but these findings warrant more and better quality research designed to examine the associations between religion and health and the potential relevance such associations might have for medical practice
12163,current international guidelines recommend that the goal of treatment with lipid lowering therapy in patients with established coronary artery disease cad should be a low density lipoprotein cholesterol level of mg dl
12164,the question that remains to be answered is whether more aggressive lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below this target offers additional benefit and whether it can be tolerated
12165,two recently published related studies addressed this question by comparing intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin lipitor pfizer mg day with a moderate lipid lowering regimen of pravastatin pravachol bristol myers squibb mg day
12166,the first study the reversing atherosclerosis with aggressive lipid lowering reversal compared the effect of the two regimens on coronary artery atheroma burden and progression using intravascular ultrasound in patients with symptomatic cad
12167,the second study the pravastatin or atorvastatin evaluation and infection therapy prove it was a clinical outcome trial in patients recently hospitalised with acute coronary syndromes
12168,this article reviews the implications of these two studies in the management of patients with cad
12169,in addition other ongoing trials and future directions are explored
12170,atorvastatin calcium ac is a bcs class ii drug which shows poor bioavailability due to inadequate dissolution
12171,solid dispersions present a promising option to enhance the solubility of poorly soluble drugs
12172,co grinding with hydrophilic excipients is an easy and economical technique to improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs and is free from usage of organic solvents
12173,the aim of the present study was to explore novel carrier vbp organosulphur compound for formulating a solid dispersion by using a simple commercially viable co grinding technique to enhance the dissolution of ac and to develop an oral formulation of the same
12174,composition of the solid dispersion was optimized based on the release profile in ph buffer
12175,the optimized solid dispersion was further characterized for flow properties dsc ftir spectroscopy xrd contact angle sem studies and release profile in phosphate buffer ph the developed solid dispersion gave similar release profile as the innovator formulation lipitor tablets in both ph buffer and phosphate buffer ph the developed solid dispersion was formulated into hard gelatin capsules size
12176,the developed capsules were found to give similar release as the innovator formulation in both ph buffer and phosphate buffer ph the developed capsules were found to be stable for a period of months
12177,anti hyperlipidemic efficacy studies in rats showed higher reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels by the developed capsules in comparison to pure ac
12178,in conclusion novel carrier vbp was successfully employed to enhance the dissolution of ac using co grinding technique
12179,intracranial vascular atherosclerotic occlusion is one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke world wide
12180,the involvement of large intracranial vessels in particular the middle cerebral artery is usually associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients
12181,spontaneous recanalization of atherosclerotic occlusion is relatively rare
12182,the first patient was a year old male with slurred speech and left sided weakness for a duration of hours
12183,the second was a year old male with left sided weakness over a period of hours
12184,the last was a year old female patient presented with a month history of right sided headache
12185,atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery occlusion
12186,in all cases oral aspirin mg once daily plavix mg once daily and lipitor mg once daily were used
12187,oral plavix was stopped months
12188,spontaneous recanalization occured in the three cases of atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery occlusion
12189,spontaneous recanalization may occur in both early and late stages of atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery occlusion
12190,clinicians should be aware of this particular condition as it may represent a relatively favorable prognosis
12191,shen yuan dan capsule sydc a traditional chinese medicine is proposed to have the capacity to prevent angina pectoris
12192,however the effects and the related mechanisms of sydc on atherosclerosis as are still unknown
12193,this study was designed to investigate the effects of sydc on as and inflammatory reaction in the apoliprotein e knockout apoe
12194,thirty eight week old male apoe
12195,the data showed that the levels of total cholesterol tc triglyceride tg low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c atherosclerotic indexes ai and the corrected areas of atherosclerotic plaque of the mice on sydc group were significantly decreased compared with those of the mice in the control group p p
12196,sydc can significantly increase collagen proportion in plaques as compared to the untreated mice p
12197,in addition the messenger ribonucleic acid mrna expressions of insulin receptor substrate irs pik akt nf b and tumor necrosis factor tnf in the mice fed with a high fat diet were significantly reduced by sydc p p
12198,sydc can exert an anti atherosclerotic effect on apoe

12201,policy discussions concerning pharmaceutical promotion often assume that small promotional items are unlikely to influence prescribing behavior
12202,our experiment measures whether exposure to these items results in more favorable attitudes toward marketed products and whether policies that restrict pharmaceutical marketing mitigate this effect
12203,this is a randomized controlled experiment of third and fourth year medical students at two us medical schools with differing policies toward pharmaceutical marketing
12204,participants assigned to treatment were exposed to small branded promotional items for lipitor atorvastatin without knowledge that the exposure was part of the study
12205,we measured differences in implicit ie unconscious attitudes toward lipitor and zocor simvastatin in exposed and control groups with the implicit association test iat
12206,self reported attitudes were also measured and a follow up survey was administered measuring attitudes toward marketing
12207,fourth year students at the university of miami miller school of medicine exposed to lipitor promotional items had more favorable implicit attitudes about that brand name drug compared to the control group iat effect vs p while the effect was reversed at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine iat effect vs p where restrictive policies are in place limiting pharmaceutical marketing interaction effect p
12208,no significant effect was observed among third year students
12209,on a skepticism scale university of miami students held more favorable attitudes toward pharmaceutical marketing compared to university of pennsylvania students vs p but the results were similar to those of a previously published national study vs p
12210,subtle exposure to small pharmaceutical promotional items influences implicit attitudes toward marketed products among medical students
12211,we observed a reversal of this effect in the setting of restrictive policies and more negative school level attitudes toward marketing
12212,patients with type diabetes mellitus have a high risk of cardiovascular disease mainly caused by dyslipidemia
12213,metformin and atorvastatin are preferentially used to treat type diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia respectively
12214,the aim of this study was to develop a once a day fixed dose combination tablet containing metformin and atorvastatin
12215,for this purpose we designed gastroretentive bilayer tablets consisting of mg metformin in a sustained release layer and mg atorvastatin in an immediate release layer
12216,in addition we modified the formulation to maintain a dual release pattern for the kinetically different layers for once daily dosing
12217,the gastroretentive bilayer tablet was developed using polyethylene oxide as a swellable polymer and ammonium methacrylate copolymer as a granule coating polymer with minimal use of excipients
12218,in vitro release patterns of metformin and atorvastatin from the developed formulation were similar to those of the reference drugs glucophage xr for metformin and lipitor for atorvastatin with satisfactory dissolution similarity factor f values
12219,the pharmacokinetic study showed the sustained and immediate absorptions of metformin and atorvastatin respectively in beagle dogs
12220,the confidence intervals of the ratios of ln values of aucs of test formulation f and respective reference formulations of metformin and atorvastatin were and respectively compared with their respective reference drugs
12221,this formulation could contribute to improving the compliance and therapeutic outcome of patients with metabolic diseases
12222,blockbuster drugs which are widely prescribed and improve the health of millions often originate in fundamental laboratory research
12223,an important example of such drugs are the cholesterol lowering drugs called statins including zocor pravachol and lipitor which millions of people take in the u s every year
12224,this short paper outlines the direct and indirect contributions of federally sponsored research to the development of these important drugs
12225,biomarkers to predict recurrent stroke and targets of therapy to prevent stroke are lacking
12226,this study evaluated whether patients with prior cerebrovascular events and elevated levels of oxidized phospholipids on apolipoprotein b oxpl apob but without prior coronary artery disease cad are at risk for recurrent stroke and cad events following high dose statin therapy
12227,in the sparcl stroke prevention by aggressive reduction in cholesterol levels trial oxpl apob levels were measured in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack at baseline and in patients at years following randomization to placebo or mg atorvastatin
12228,the primary endpoint was the time from randomization to a second nonfatal or fatal stroke
12229,secondary endpoints included first major coronary events and any cardiovascular event
12230,patients with recurrent stroke had higher baseline median oxpl apob levels than patients without nmol l vs nmol l p
12231,after multivariable adjustment elevated baseline oxpl apob predicted recurrent stroke hazard ratio hr p first major coronary events hr p and any cardiovascular event hr p
12232,these comparisons for any endpoint did not differ by treatment shown as a nonsignificant interaction test
12233,the net reclassification improvement integrated discrimination improvement and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc were all significantly improved by adding oxpl apob to the models with auc p for recurrent stroke auc p for first major coronary event and auc p for any cardiovascular event
12234,elevated oxpl apob levels predicted recurrent stroke and first major coronary events in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack
12235,the lack of statin oxpl apob treatment interaction suggested that oxpls might be statin independent therapeutic targets to reduce risk of cardiovascular events
12236,lipitor in the prevention of stroke for patients who have had a previous stroke sparcl nct
12237,this study was designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the generic formulation atorva
12238,this study was a prospective open label randomized controlled study
12239,hypercholesterolemic patients who had not achieved low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol goals according to the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii ncep atp iii guideline were randomized to generic formulation or reference formulation of atorvastatin
12240,the primary end point was the percent change of blood ldl cholesterol at weeks from the baseline
12241,the secondary end points included the percent changes of total cholesterol high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol triglyceride tg apolipoprotein b apob and apolipoprotein a apoa levels the percent changes of apob apoa and total cholesterol hdl cholesterol ratios and the change in high sensitivity c reactive protein hscrp levels
12242,the ldl cholesterol goal achievement rate according to the ncep atp iii guideline was also evaluated
12243,three hundred and seventy six patients were randomized and patients in the generic group and in the reference group completed the study
12244,after the weeks of treatment ldl cholesterol level was significantly decreased in both the groups and the decrement was comparable between the two groups in the generic group in the reference group
12245,the generic formulation of atorvastatin mg was not inferior to the reference formulation of atorvastatin mg in the management of hypercholesterolemia
12246,background this retrospective clinical investigation aimed to evaluate the short term effectiveness and safety of sbcas for symptomatic bilateral high grade cs
12247,material and methods from to patients were recruited
12248,among them underwent sbcas and other patients underwent samm and served as controls
12249,the immediate postprocedural complications and postprocedural neurological evaluation as well as restenosis at month and year follow ups in the sbcas group are reported
12250,additionally baseline risk factors for ischemic stroke adverse effects of drugs and outcomes at day month and year follow ups were compared between the groups
12251,results our data did not reveal significant differences between the groups in baseline risk factors for ischemic stroke
12252,in the sbcas group both hps and hd occurred but they were not very severe and no patients had postprocedural neurological deficit
12253,moreover restenosis only occurred in patients at stent placement sites at year follow up
12254,adverse effects of drugs did not occur in sbcas group but adverse effects of bayer aspirin and lipitor occurred in patients and patients respectively at month follow up in the control group
12255,furthermore there were significant differences in outcomes between the groups at day month and year follow ups in that nihss cs ratio and incidence of endpoint events as well as year cumulative probability of endpoint events were all lower in the sbcas group than in the control group p
12256,conclusions compared to samm we found that sbcas was more effective and safer for symptomatic bilateral high grade cs
12258,compound chuanxiong capsule ccc a chinese herbal compound can exhibit antiatherosclerotic effect however its mechanism is still unclear
12259,this study is designed to study the mechanism of ccc on atherosclerosis in the apoe knockout apoe mice fed with a high fat diet
12260,after weeks of high fat feeding apoe mice were randomized n and treated with lipitor high dose or low dose ccc or distilled water apoe group for weeks
12261,the blood lipids in serum and the plaque areas of the mice were measured and the mrna expressions of phosphatidylinositol kinases pik akt nuclear factor kappa b nf b tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukin il of the aortae were determined
12262,the data showed that ccc can significantly decrease the levels of blood lipids atherosclerosis index and plaque areas and increase collagen proportion in plaques as compared with the untreated mice p p
12263,in addition ccc can significantly reduce the mrna expressions of pik akt nf b il and tnf in the mice fed with a high fat diet p
12264,thus we concluded that ccc can inhibit inflammatory reaction in the apoe mice fed with a high fat diet
12265,this mechanism may be attributed to regulating pik akt nf b signaling pathway
12266,in glagov published a provocative hypothesis that the principal initial response to plaque accumulation was enlargement of the vessel as a whole remodeling which preserved luminal diameter until the lesion occupied a substantial proportion of the area within the elastic external membrane eem
12267,this model has been confirmed and extended by intravascular ultrasound ivus studies
12268,remodeling renders most atheromas invisible to angiography
12269,in patients with single vessel disease the mean percent of eem area occupied by atheroma at a segment with an angiographically normal appearance is
12270,ivus studies further show that the disease progresses in a diffuse manner and that stenotic lesions represent only a small proportion of the total disease burden
12271,we further know that disease can begin as early as the teenage years
12272,data suggest that up to of individuals years old may be affected
12273,atherosclerotic lesions can be effectively targeted with lipid lowering therapy
12274,preliminary data suggest that as plaques stabilize and become smaller a reverse modeling occurs the eem area decreases but the lumen size remains unchanged
12275,this may explain why significant reductions in cardiovascular events in clinical trials were accompanied by only modest angiographic evidence of regression
12276,this hypothesis will be tested prospectively in the reversal of atherosclerosis with lipitor reversal study
12277,to determine the impact of two isocaloric diets containing and energy from fat protein and carbohydrate respectively western diet wd rich in saturated fat refined carbohydrate low in fiber and high in cholesterol and a heart healthy diet hhd rich in unsaturated fat unrefined carbohydrate fruits vegetables high in fiber and low in cholesterol on the composition and function of the gut microbiome
12278,thirty ossabaw pigs were fed wd or hhd diets with half within each group therapeutically treated with statin atorvastatin lipitor
12279,the fecal microbiome was analyzed one and six months after dietary intervention by s rrna sequencing and metagenomic function was empirically inferred
12280,genus diversity was transiently affected with a reduced shannon diversity index one month after feeding the wd or hhd fdr
12281,these data document for the first time a distinctive bacterial profile in ossabaw pigs with a diet induced dyslipidemia and early stage atherosclerosis
12282,taken together these results represent a new model to examine mechanistic pathways of dietary patterns and or drug interactions and its effect on modulating microbiome in developing atherosclerosis

12284,statins hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitors have been used for a decade to lower low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels and to improve cardiovascular disease and clinical outcomes
12285,to evaluate the safety profile of atorvastatin lipitor
12286,data were pooled for completed patients and ongoing patients clinical trials of atorvastatin conducted in us and international community and university based research centers
12287,in these trials patients with lipid disorders received atorvastatin at dosages of to mg d
12288,the majority of patients had moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia and were treated from weeks to more than months
12289,transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels and adverse events were recorded
12290,atorvastatin was well tolerated fewer than of the atorvastatin treated patients withdrew due to drug attributable adverse events
12291,the overall adverse event profile for atorvastatin was similar to that observed with other statins
12292,the most common adverse events with atorvastatin as well as with other statins tested were constipation flatulence dyspepsia and abdominal pain
12293,approximately of atorvastatin treated patients had serious adverse events only of these events were possibly associated with treatment
12294,thirty patients had confirmed transaminase elevations greater than times the upper limit of the normal range
12295,most elevations occurred within weeks of beginning treatment
12296,no patients had a conclusive characterization of drug induced myopathy
12297,the safety profile of atorvastatin was consistent with that of all statins tested and was similar to that seen in all compounds of this class
12298,statins lower cholesterol and adverse cardiovascular outcomes but this drug class increases diabetes risk
12299,statins are generally anti inflammatory
12300,however statins can promote inflammasome mediated adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance through an unidentified immune effector
12301,statins lower mevalonate pathway intermediates beyond cholesterol but it is unknown whether lower cholesterol underpins statin mediated insulin resistance
12302,we sought to define the mevalonate pathway metabolites and immune effectors that propagate statin induced adipose insulin resistance
12303,we found that ldl cholesterol lowering was dispensable but statin induced lowering of isoprenoids required for protein prenylation triggered nlrp caspase inflammasome activation and interleukin il dependent insulin resistance in adipose tissue
12304,multiple statins impaired insulin action at the level of akt protein kinase b signaling in mouse adipose tissue
12305,providing geranylgeranyl isoprenoids or inhibiting caspase prevented statin induced defects in insulin signaling
12306,atorvastatin lipitor impaired insulin signaling in adipose tissue from wild type and il
12307,familial hypercholesterolaemia fh affects in people in the uk population and is associated with premature morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease
12308,in national institute for health and care excellence nice recommended genetic testing of potential fh index cases and cascade testing of their relatives
12309,commissioners have been slow to respond although there is strong evidence of cost and clinical effectiveness
12310,our study quantifies the recent reduced cost of providing a fh service using generic atorvastatin and compares nice costing estimates with three suggested alternative models of care a specialist led service a dual model service where general practitioners gps can access specialist advice and a gp led service
12311,revision of existing year costing template provided by nice for fh services and prediction of costs for running a programme over years
12312,costs were modelled for the first population based fh service in england which covers southampton hampshire isle of wight and portsmouth ship
12313,population million
12314,with expiry of the lipitor pfizer atorvastatin patent the cost of providing a year fh service in ship reduces by million on patent vs million off patent
12315,further cost reductions are possible as a result of the reduced cost of dna testing more management in general practice and lower referral rates to specialists
12316,for instance a dual care model with gp management of patients supported by specialist advice when required costs million
12317,the three alternative models of care are now of the cost of the original estimates undertaken by nice
12318,disease modifying therapies are being developed for alzheimer s disease ad
12319,these are expected to slow the clinical progression of the disease or delay its onset
12320,cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta a beta peptides is an early and perhaps necessary event for establishing ad pathology
12321,consequently therapies aimed at attenuating brain amyloidosis are expected to be disease modifying
12322,based on the epidemiological evidence pointing to a link between cholesterol metabolism and ad and the numerous laboratory studies implicating cholesterol in the process of a beta production and accumulation it is now believed that cholesterol lowering therapies will be of value as disease modifying agents
12323,several epidemiological studies revealed that statin use for the treatment of coronary arterial disease is associated with a decreased prevalence or a decreased risk of developing ad
12324,these observations require both preclinical and clinical validation
12325,the former involves testing statins in one or more animal models of ad in order to establish which disease features are affected by statin treatment the relative efficacy with which different statins modify these features and the mechanism s by which statins affect ad phenotypes
12326,the latter requires prospective randomized placebo controlled trials to evaluate the effect of statin treatment on cognitive and ad biomarker outcomes
12327,we have initiated a study aimed at determining the effects of atorvastatin lipitor a statin with the largest us market share on brain a beta deposition in the psapp transgenic mouse model of alzheimer s amyloidosis
12328,our results indicate that lipitor treatment markedly attenuates a beta deposition in this animal model
12329,intracellular pathogens have complex metabolic interactions with their host cells to ensure a steady supply of energy and anabolic building blocks for rapid growth
12330,here we use the obligate intracellular parasite toxoplasma gondii to probe this interaction for isoprenoids abundant lipidic compounds essential to many cellular processes including signaling trafficking energy metabolism and protein translation
12331,synthesis of precursors for isoprenoids in apicomplexa occurs in the apicoplast and is essential
12332,to synthesize longer isoprenoids from these precursors t gondii expresses a bifunctional farnesyl diphosphate geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase tgfpps
12333,in this work we construct and characterize t gondii null mutants for this enzyme
12334,surprisingly these mutants have only a mild growth phenotype and an isoprenoid composition similar to wild type parasites
12335,however when extracellular the loss of the enzyme becomes phenotypically apparent
12336,this strongly suggests that intracellular parasite salvage fpp and or geranylgeranyl diphosphate ggpp from the host
12337,we test this hypothesis using inhibitors of host cell isoprenoid synthesis
12338,mammals use the mevalonate pathway which is susceptible to statins
12339,we document strong synergy between statin treatment and pharmacological or genetic interference with the parasite isoprenoid pathway
12340,mice can be cured with atorvastatin lipitor from a lethal infection with the tgfpps mutant
12341,we propose a double hit strategy combining inhibitors of host and parasite pathways as a novel therapeutic approach against apicomplexan parasites
12342,serious efforts have been made to overcome the bioavailability problems of ever increasing number of poorly soluble drugs including atorvastatin ato however enhancing its gastric solubility has not received much attention
12343,to improve the bioavailability of ato by increasing its gastric solubility in a stable oral disintegration tablet odt formulation
12344,amorphous solid dispersion asd of ato with eudragit epo was used as api in odt formulation
12345,characterization using differential scanning calorimetry powder x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared drug polymer interaction simulated by molecular modeling solubility dissolution and stability studies together with in vivo evaluation
12346,in asd there was uniform distribution of drug in the polymer and it retained the amorphous nature without any chemical interactions except the possibility of hydrogen bond formation with substantially higher gastric solubility
12347,the dissolution profile of the odt containing asd was significantly improved within min compared with of plain ato formulation
12348,in vivo results showed an overall enhancement in the apparent bioavailability and more than lipitor and plain amorphous ato tablets respectively
12349,combining the asd with odt presents a reliable solution to overcome the low solubility and bioavailability problems of ato in a simple robust and cost effective formulation
12350,in australian competition and consumer commission v pfizer australia pty ltd fca the accc alleged that pfizer s project leap involved a scheme to lock pharmacists into substituting its generic version of the high sales volume anti cholesterol drug patent expired atorvastatin lipitor which took advantage of a substantial degree of market power for a purpose proscribed by s c of the competition and consumer act cth
12351,the accc also claimed that pfizer s actions constituted a course of exclusive dealing pursuant to s d and e for the proscribed purpose of lessening competition
12352,flick j in the federal court of australia in a judgment heavy with quotations but sparse in reasoning dismissed the accc s amended originating application alleging abuse of market power and ordered the accc to pay pfizer s costs
12353,the accc has now appealed the decision
12354,this column explores this case in the context of pfizer s broader strategies to preserve its income globally from this high sales volume drug in the period following its patent expiration
12355,in this work a capillary electrophoretic method for the rapid quantitation of atorvastatin at in a lipitor tablet was investigated and developed
12356,method development included studies of the effect of applied potential buffer concentration buffer ph and hydrodynamic injection time on the electrophoretic separation
12357,the method was validated with regard to linearity precision specificity lod and loq
12358,the optimum electrophoretic separation conditions were mm sodium acetate buffer at ph with a separation voltage of kv using a microm capillary of cm total length
12359,sodium diclofenac was used as an internal standard
12360,analysis of at in a commercial lipitor tablet by electrophoresis gave quite high efficiency coupled with an analysis time of less than min in comparison to lc
12361,once the separation was optimized on capillary it was further miniaturized to a microchip platform with linear imaging uv detection using microchip electrophoresis mce
12362,linear imaging uv detection allowed for real time monitoring of the analyte movement on chip so that the optimum separation time could be easily determined
12363,this microchip electrophoretic method was compared to the ce method with regard to speed efficiency precision and lod
12364,this work represents the most rapid and first reported analysis of at using mce
12365,the medicinal plants artemisia iwayomogi and curcuma longa radix are both used to treat hyperlipidemia in traditional korean and chinese medicine
12366,to evaluate the anti hyperlipidemic effects of the ethanol extracts of a iwayomogi ai c longa cl and the mixture of a iwayomogi and c longa ace using a high fat diet induced hyperlipidemia model
12367,six of seven groups of cbl n male mice i e not including the na ve group were fed a high fat diet freely for weeks
12368,of these six groups five i e not including the control group were administered a high fat diet supplemented with ai mg kg cl mg kg ace or mg kg or lipitor mg kg
12369,serum lipid profiles obesity related markers hepatic steatosis hepatic gene expression and oxidative stress markers were analyzed
12370,ai cl and ace were associated with significant effects on serum lipid profiles total cholesterol tc and triglyceride body liver and peritoneal adipose tissue weights hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress biomarkers
12371,ace at mg kg was associated with significantly greater improvements in serum tc and triglyceride hepatic triglyceride epididymal adipocyte size and oxidative stress biomarkers compared with ai and cl
12372,ai cl and ace normalized lipid synthesis associated gene expression peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma fatty acid synthase sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor c and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha
12373,ace exhibits anti hyperlipidemia properties and is associated with partially synergistic effects compared with ai or cl alone
12374,the aim of this study was to improve the solubility stability and bioavailability of amorphous atorvastatin calcium at by complexing it with hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin
12375,the formation of the inclusion complexation was identified by molecular modeling phase solubility diagrams differential scanning calorimetry and x ray powder diffractometry
12376,orally disintegrating tablets odt were then manufactured by direct compression
12377,apart from improved stability compared to pure at disintegration time of s hardness of kg and favorable mouth feel were achieved
12378,in vitro dissolution tests of the odt of at inclusion complex exhibited higher dissolution rates than those with pure drug and the commercial tablet lipitor
12379,in vivo bioavailability studies in rats also showed shorter t max higher c max and increased auc of and fold compared to the plain drug odt and lipitor
12380,these results strongly suggest to use hp beta cd to improve the physicochemical characteristics and bioavailability of at
12381,hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase hmgcoar is required for isoprenoid and cholesterol biosynthesis
12382,in drosophila reduced hmgcoar activity results in germ cell migration defects
12383,we show that pharmacological hmgcoar inhibition alters zebrafish development and germ cell migration
12384,embryos treated with atorvastatin lipitor exhibited germ cell migration defects and mild morphologic abnormalities
12385,the effects induced by atorvastatin were completely rescued by prior injection of mevalonate the product of hmgcoar activity or the prenylation precursors farnesol and geranylgeraniol
12386,in contrast squalene a cholesterol intermediate further down the pathway failed to rescue statin induced defects
12387,moreover pharmacologic inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase ggt protein prenylation activity also resulted in abnormal germ cell migration
12388,thus our pharmacological inhibition and rescue approach provided detailed information about the elements of isoprenoid biosynthesis that contribute to germ cell migration
12389,together with data from drosophila santos and lehmann this issue our results highlight a conserved role for protein geranylgeranylation in this context
12390,statins including atorvastatin lipitor are the top selling drugs in the world
12391,the biocatalytic production of chiral side chains of statin drugs is of great interest to academia and industry
12392,stereoselective double reduction of a beta delta diketo ester catalyzed by a diketoreductase offers a simple and efficient route for the preparation of statin side chains
12393,comparison of different cofactor regeneration systems resulted in an easy and cost effective process for this enzymatic reduction
12394,statins are inhibitors of hmg coa reductase that have been recently recognized as anti inflammatory and neuroprotective drugs
12395,herein we investigated anti excitotoxic and anti seizure effects of statins by using kainic acid ka rat seizure model an animal model for temporal lobe epilepsy and excitotoxic neurodegeneration
12396,we observed that pre treatment with lipitor atorvastatin efficiently reduced ka induced seizure activities hippocampal neuron death monocyte infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression
12397,in addition we also observed that lovastatin treatment attenuated ka or glutamate induced excitotoxicity of cultured hippocampal neurons
12398,these observations suggest a potential for use of statin treatment in modulation of seizures and other neurological diseases associated with excitotoxicity
12399,the discovery from nature of a large and diverse set of nitrilases is reported
12400,the utility of this nitrilase library for identifying enzymes that catalyze efficient production of valuable hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives is demonstrated
12401,unprecedented enantioselectivity and substrate scope are highlighted for three newly discovered and distinct nitrilases
12402,for example a wide array of r mandelic acid derivatives and analogues were produced with high rates yields and enantiomeric excesses ee
12403,we also have found nitrilases that provide direct access to s phenyllactic acid and other aryllactic acid derivatives again with high yields and enantioselectivities
12404,finally different nitrilases have been discovered that catalyze enantiotopic hydrolysis of hydroxyglutaronitrile to afford either enantiomer of cyano hydroxybutyric acid with high enantiomeric excesses ee
12405,the first enzymes are reported that effect this transformation to furnish the r cyano hydroxybutyric acid which is a precursor to the blockbuster drug lipitor
12406,atorvastatin calcium atc is the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of the best selling lipid lowering formulation lipitor
12407,twelve atc crystal forms are known and several pharmaceutical companies are developing or have developed generic drug formulations based on different atc polymorphs
12408,the strong overlap of the x ray diffraction patterns xrd of the polymorphs with the respective patterns of the excipients the presence of small api quantities in the tablet and the similarity of the crystal phase viii xrd pattern used in the tablet examined in this work to that of phases iv and ix made identification difficult
12409,quantitative determination of atc was attempted using raman spectroscopy rs ir spectroscopy and x ray powder diffraction
12410,it was found that rs exhibited lower detection limit and a calibration model was constructed
12411,its application on commercial atc tablets with mg strength yielded an error of
12412,statins have multiple pleiotropic effects that are independent of their cholesterol lowering properties including rapid improvement of endothelial function in vitro
12413,hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and we hypothesized that a single dose of atorvastatin may have an acute effect on vascular function
12414,endothelium dependent vasodilation edv and endothelium independent vasodilation were assessed with venous occlusion plethysmography during intra arterial infusion of acetylcholine ach and sodium nitroprusside snp respectively in hypertensive men after wash out from antihypertensive medication
12415,vasoconstrictive responses were evaluated in response to angiotensin ii ang ii infusion
12416,the protocol was repeated h after mg oral atorvastatin atv lipitor
12417,atv treatment significantly increased baseline forearm blood flow from to ml min ml tissue p
12418,atv did not affect ach induced edv
12419,forearm vascular resistance in response to snp was significantly lowered by atv p
12420,vasoconstriction in response to ang ii was significantly inhibited by atv treatment p
12421,the observed acute statin effects in hypertension appear to be endothelium independent and related to vascular smooth muscle cell function
12422,these actions may in part contribute to the beneficial pleiotropic effects of statin therapy even in the acute in vivo setting
12423,we determined the effect of atorvastatin on myocardial apoptosis and caspase activation following coronary microembolization cme in a rat model
12424,for this rats were randomly and equally divided into cme sham operated control atorvastatin lavage gastric lavage control and caspase inhibitor cho groups
12425,in cme animals a microembolization ball was injected through the left ventricle
12426,sham animals were injected with normal saline ns
12427,atorvastatin group received atorvastatin gastric lavage once a day week before surgery
12428,gastric lavage controls had similar lavage with ns
12429,cho group was i p injected cho mg kg min before surgery
12430,cardiac indices in each group were determined by echocardiography h postoperatively
12431,tunel assay and western blot were used for myocardial apoptosis and expression of caspases respectively
12432,echocardiography data show that left ventricular ejection fraction lvef in cme group was significantly decreased p compared with sham controls
12433,besides left ventricular fractional shortening fs and cardiac output co were also decreased with an increase in left ventricular end diastolic dimension lvedd
12434,atorvastatin and cho animals had significantly improved p cardiac function compared with cme group
12435,myocardial apoptosis and activation levels of caspases were significantly increased p compared with sham myocardial apoptosis and activation levels of caspases were significantly decreased p in atorvastatin and cho groups compared with cme group
12436,in conclusion atorvastatin pretreatment suppressed post cme myocardial apoptosis and improved cardiac function through the blockade of a myocardial death receptor mediated apoptotic pathway
12437,in the business world creativity has become the latest buzzword
12438,how to attract nurture and direct the extraordinarily talented people who will come up with the next lipitor sonywalkman or ipod is an enduring topic among business people
12439,as the director of the macarthur fellows program daniel j socolow has considerable experience with the process of rooting out creativity
12440,in this conversation with hbr senior editor diane coutu he describes how recipients of the genius grant half a million dollars with no strings attached are chosen
12441,as significant as the money is the recognition that comes with a fellowship may be more so
12442,macarthur grants provide powerful validation of the fellows work socolow says and that validation opens doors for people whatever the field
12443,although the program keeps a lookout for entrepreneurs who are on the brink of major new advances he believes that the market does a good job of rewarding the best ideas in business
12444,replicating the macarthur model in a company would entail giving some employees unlimited time and lots of money to follow their own inclinations not very feasible in most contexts
12445,nevertheless the program has learned a lesson that may be valuable for business the kind of creativity that leads to important breakthroughs is extremely hard to find
12446,and says socolow exceptionally creative people aren t always the obvious suspects who may simply be good at promoting themselves listen to others and look in the least likely places extend your networks and try to get information from as many people as possible just as we do
12447,some recent clinical trials have concluded the following patients who need noncardiac surgery and who are at risk of major cardiac events should not undergo revascularization with the aim of achieving a better perioperative outcome
12448,they should have an office evaluation only and be prescribed a beta blocker if indicated
12449,except for unusual high risk cases patients at risk of stroke due to atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis should undergo carotid endarterectomy rather than carotid stenting
12450,because the technology is still developing however carotid stenting may still be appropriate as part of a clinical trial
12451,although drug eluting coronary stents reduce the risk of restenosis in the short term they pose a small but significant risk of in stent thrombosis
12452,clopidogrel plavix should be prescribed for at least a year following drug eluting stent placement and perhaps indefinitely
12453,patients with known coronary heart disease have better outcomes if they receive aggressive statin therapy eg atorvastatin lipitor mg day to lower their serum levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to less than mg dl
12454,to examine whether local area pharmacy market structure influences contract terms between prescription drug plans pdps and pharmacies under part d
12455,data were collected and compiled from four sources a national mail survey to independent pharmacies national councilfor prescription drug programs ncpdp pharmacy database u s census data and economic census data
12456,reimbursements varied substantially across pharmacies
12457,reimbursement for mg lipitor tablets ranged from to and for mg lisinopril tablets it ranged from to
12458,for brand name drug lipitor local area pharmacy ownership concentration had a consistent positive effect on pharmacy bargaining power across model specifications estimates between and while local area per capita income had a consistent negative effect on pharmacy bargaining power across specifications to
12459,few statistically significant relationships were found for generic drug lisinopril
12460,significant variation exists in pdp reimbursement and pharmacy bargaining power with pdps
12461,pharmacy bargaining power is negatively related to the competition level and the income level in the area
12462,these relationships are stronger for brand name than for generics
12463,as contract offers tend to be non negotiable variation in reimbursements and pharmacy bargaining power reflect differences in initial insurer contract offerings
12464,such observations fit rubinstein s subgame perfect equilibrium model
12465,our results suggest pharmacies at the most risk of closing due to low reimbursements are in areas with many competing pharmacies
12466,this implies that closures related to part d changes will have limited effect on medicare beneficiaries access to pharmacies
12467,a process is reported for efficient enantioselective production of key intermediates for the common chiral side chain of statin type cholesterol lowering drugs such as lipitor atorvastatin and crestor rosuvastatin
12468,the process features a one pot tandem aldol reaction catalyzed by a deoxyribose phosphate aldolase dera to form a carbon intermediate with installation of two stereogenic centers from carbon starting materials
12469,an improvement of almost fold in volumetric productivity relative to the published enzymatic reaction conditions has been achieved resulting in a commercially attractive process that has been run on up to a g scale in a single batch at a rate of g liter per h catalyst load has been improved by fold as well from to wt dera
12470,these improvements were achieved by a combination of discovery from environmental dna of deras with improved activity and reaction optimization to overcome substrate inhibition
12471,the two stereogenic centers are set by dera with enantiomeric excess at and diastereomeric excess at
12472,in addition down stream chemical steps have been developed to convert the enzymatic product efficiently to versatile intermediates applicable to preparation of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin
12473,the effect of atorvastatin lipitor on diabetes induced changes in plasma lipids oxidative stress and the ability of aortic tissues to generate prostacyclin was studied in streptozotocin diabetic rats
12474,in diabetic rats plasma total cholesterol triglycerides and serum glucose significantly increased compared to nondiabetic rats
12475,atorvastatin administration to diabetic rats did not affect hyperglycemia but significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides compared to diabetic rats
12476,the oxidative stress markers urinary isoprostane liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances tbars and plasma protein carbonyl content significantly increased in diabetic rats compared to nondiabetic rats
12477,atorvastatin admnistration to diabetic rats significantly reduced oxidative stress levels compared to diabetic rats but urinary isoprostane and liver tbars remained significantly higher than nondiabetic rats
12478,prostacyclin pgi generation by aortic tissues significantly decreased in diabetic rats compared to nondiabetic rats
12479,atorvastatin administration to diabetic rats did not reverse that inhibition
12480,these results were discussed in the light of the possible effects of hyperglycemia and statins on nad p h oxidase and cyclooxygenase activities and the genetic difference between rats and other mammals regarding the level of vascular superoxide dismutase sod activity
12481,atorvastatin is an antilipemic drug belonging to the statins class whose reference drug is pfizer s lipitor
12482,it is used to reduce the levels of lipoproteins rich in cholesterol and reduce the risk of coronary artery disease
12483,it is well known that calcium atorvastatin atv c h caf n o h o presents polymorphism
12484,the drug in question is commonly sought after by pharmaceutical industries that produce generic drugs due to the fact that the drug has a high value price it is consumed globally and its patent expired in late many questions concerning this drug s pharmaceutical scope demonstrate its importance regarding stability studies and the identification of degradation products of drugs and pharmaceutical formulations
12485,atv has been found to degrade under acid and basic conditions including a first order kinetic degradation under acid conditions as compared to a zero order kinetic degradation under basic conditions which tends to be less stable when studied within acid mediums
12486,the rate constant k for degradation in acid medium was s first order while for basic medium k mol l s zero order demonstrating a lower stability of the drug within acid mediums
12487,to explore evolution rules of phlegm and blood stasis syndrome pbss in hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis as using nmr based metabolic profiling and metabonomic approaches based on formulas corresponding to syndrome
12488,totally sd rats were divided into the normal group the model group the erchen decoction ed group the xuefu zhuyu decoction xzd group the lipitor group in each group
12489,the hyperlipidemia and as rat model was duplicated by suturing carotid artery injecting vitamin d and feeding with high fat diet
12490,ed and xzd were used as drug probes
12491,blood samples were withdrawn at week and after modeling
12492,blood lipids blood rheology histopathology and metabolomics were detected and analyzed
12493,results results of blood lipids and pathology showed hyperlipidemia and early as rat models were successfully established
12494,at week after modeling levels of total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c significantly increased which reached the peak at week and maintained at higher levels at week ed exerted obvious effect in improving tc and ldl c levels of early models while xzd could greatly improve levels of tc and ldl c of late models
12495,rheological results showed at week there was no significant difference in whole blood viscosity plasma viscosity or hematocrit between the model group and the normal group p
12496,at week partial hemorheological indicators such as plasma viscosity were abnormal
12497,till week whole blood viscosity plasma viscosity and hematocrit were significantly abnormal p
12499,as time went by whole blood viscosity plasma viscosity and hematocrit showed gradual increasing tendency in the ed group while they showed gradual decreasing tendency in the xzd group
12500,results of metabonomics showed significant difference in spectra of metabolites between the normal group and the model group
12501,as modeling time was prolonged contents of acetyl glucoprotein and glucose in the model group increased in late stage which was in
12502,line with results of blood lipids and hemorheology
12503,ed showed more obvious effect in early and mid term modeling at week and and increased contents of partial metabolites such as choline phosphatidyl choline glycerophosphocholine but these changes in the xzd group were consistent with those of the model group
12504,in late modeling at week xzd showed more obvious effect in improving contents of lactic acid acetyl glycoprotein ldl creatine choline and glucose
12505,ed and xzd not only showed regulatory effects on lipid disorders but also could improve dysbolism of chos
12506,in formulas corresponding to syndrome damp phlegm was main pathogenesis of hyperlipidema and as in early and mid stages
12507,blood stasis syndrome began to occur along with it progressed
12508,phlegm can result in blood stasis and intermingles with stasis
12509,phlegm turbidity runs through the whole process
12510,to estimate the concurrent use between statins and amiodarone in context with published case reports of drug interaction induced rhabdomyolysis
12511,retrospective analysis of a longitudinal prescription claims database for concurrent prescriptions of statins and amiodarone dispensed during
12512,the study population includes an unprojected annual number of patients who filled a prescription for an hmg coa reductase inhibitor or simvastatin containing products or lovastatin containing products or lipitor atorvastatin or caduet amlodipine atorvastatin concurrently with brand and generic forms of amiodarone during the concurrency analysis was used to provide context for published case reports of rhabdomyolysis myopathy related to simvastatin and amiodarone concurrent use
12513,episodes of concurrent use between statins and amiodarone
12514,findings from this analysis indicate noteworthy amiodarone and statin concurrency when based on amiodarone patient volume
12515,atorvastatin had the greatest level of concurrency with amiodarone followed by simvastatin
12516,proportionality based on amiodarone patient volume shows a greater level of concurrency with mg and mg simvastatin strengths compared with other simvastatin strengths
12517,clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring the regimens of patients prescribed a statin with drugs that may increase the risk of myopathy
12518,in particular since nearly half of the patients prescribed amiodarone may also be prescribed a statin then addition of amiodarone or changes in statin dose should trigger a drug regimen review and patient level monitoring
12519,clinicians should avoid simvastatin doses greater than mg per day in patients taking amiodarone
12520,the aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability of two atorvastatin formulations divator drogsan pharmaceuticals ankara turkey as the test formulation and lipitor pfizer ireland pharmaceuticals dublin ireland as the reference formulation in healthy volunteers
12521,the study was conducted using a randomised single dose two way crossover study with a week washout period between the doses
12522,since the confidence intervals for cmax auc and auc proprtional to ratios for both the parent atorvastatin and its main active metabolite ortho hydroxy atorvastatin were within the pre defined bioequivalance acceptance limits approved by emea we concluded that the atorvastatin formulation elaborated by drogsan pharmaceuticals was bioequivalent to the lipitor in its rate and extent of absorption
12523,a year old saudi male school teacher presented with clinical features of nephrotic syndrome
12524,physical examination revealed loss of subcutaneous fat over the face and upper arms partial lipodystrophy and drusen in both eyes
12525,the serum level of complement c was low with normal c
12526,renal biopsy revealed features consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulo nephritis mpgn type ii dense deposit disease ddd
12527,he was treated with prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil with partial remission
12528,he also received lipitor and lisinopril
12529,the occurrence of partial lipo dystrophy and drusen in a patient with nephrotic syndrome provides a rare clinical opportunity of making a bedside diagnosis of type ii mpgn even before kidney biopsy
12530,a full functionalization of all four positions of the thiophene ring was achieved
12531,starting from readily available dichlorothiophene successive magnesiations of the and positions using tmpmgcl x licl furnish after trapping with various electrophiles difunctionalized dichlorothiophenes
12532,subsequent dechlorination and metalation or magnesium insertion into the c cl bond provides fully functionalized thiophenes in high yields
12533,an application to the synthesis of a thiophene analogue of atorvastatin lipitor is reported
12534,reductions of carbonyl groups catalyzed by oxidoreductases are involved in all biological processes and are often a class of important biocatalyst
12535,in this article we report a novel enzyme designated as diketoreductase dkr that was able to reduce two carbonyl groups in a diketo ester to corresponding dihydroxy ester with excellent stereoselectivity
12536,the dkr was cloned from acinetobacter baylyi by reverse genetic method heterogeneously expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by two chromatographic steps
12537,this novel enzyme exhibited dual cofactor specificity with a preference of nadh over nadph
12538,the dihydroxy ester product catalyzed by the dkr was only r s stereoisomer with both diastereomeric excess and enantiomeric excess values more than
12539,in addition some biochemical properties of the enzyme such as the optimal ph and temperature were also characterized
12540,furthermore sequence analysis indicated that this new enzyme was homologous to bacterial hydroxyacyl coenzyme a dehydrogenase
12541,more importantly based on the unique catalytic activity and excellent stereoselectivity the dkr could be utilized in the synthesis of valuable chiral drug intermediates such as lipitor
12542,with the advent of new therapies and management strategies for carotid atherosclerosis there is a parallel need for measurement tools or biomarkers to evaluate the efficacy of these new strategies
12543,d ultrasound has been shown to provide reproducible measurements of plaque area volume and vessel wall volume
12544,however since carotid atherosclerosis is a focal disease that predominantly occurs at bifurcations biomarkers based on local plaque change may be more sensitive than global volumetric measurements in demonstrating efficacy of new therapies
12545,the ultimate goal of this paper is to develop a biomarker that is based on the local distribution of vessel wall plus plaque thickness change vwt change that has occurred during the course of a clinical study
12546,to allow comparison between different treatment groups the vwt change distribution of each subject must first be mapped to a standardized domain
12547,in this study we developed a technique to map the d vwt change distribution to a d standardized template
12548,we then applied a feature selection technique to identify regions on the d standardized map on which subjects in different treatment groups exhibit greater difference in vwt change
12549,the proposed algorithm was applied to analyse the vwt change of subjects in a placebo controlled study of the effect of atorvastatin lipitor
12550,the average vwt change for each subject was computed i over all points in the d map and ii over feature points only
12551,for the average computed over all points subjects per group would be required to detect an effect size of that of atorvastatin in a six month study
12552,the sample size is reduced to subjects if the average were computed over feature points only
12553,the introduction of this sensitive quantification technique for carotid atherosclerosis progression regression would allow many proof of principle studies to be performed before a more costly and longer study involving a larger population is held to confirm the treatment efficacy
12554,gene site saturation mutagenesis gssm technology is applied for the directed evolution of a nitrilase
12555,the nitrilase effectively catalyzes the desymmetrization of the prochiral substrate hydroxyglutaronitrile to afford r cyano hydroxybutyric acid a precursor to the valuable cholesterol lowering drug lipitor
12556,the discovered wild type enzyme effectively performs the reaction at the industrially relevant m substrate concentration but affords a product enantiomeric excess of only ee
12557,through gssm a mutagenesis technique that effects the combinatorial saturation of each amino acid in the protein to each of the other amino acids combined with a novel high throughput mass spectroscopy assay a number of improved variants were identified the best of which is the alahis mutant that yields product enantiomeric excess of at m substrate loading and a volumetric productivity of g l d
12558,sulfated polysaccharides from ulva lactuca were extracted in hot water and precipitated by ethanol then orally gavaged to rats fed on a hypercholesterolemic diet for days to evaluate the antihypercholesterolemic and antioxidant actions
12559,atorvastatine ca lipitor was used as a reference drug
12560,the intragastric administration of u lactuca extract to hypercholesterolemic rats caused significant decrease of serum total lipids triglycerides total cholesterol ldl cholesterol and vldl cholesterol levels
12561,whereas hdl cholesterol concentration was markedly increased by
12562,aqueous extract showed a significant ameliorative action on elevated atherogenic index creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities of hypercholesterolemic group
12563,furthermore serum activities of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase were also improved
12564,high fat diet intake caused a highly significantly elevated serum urea creatinine concentration
12565,these effects were reversed by oral administration of u lactuca extract
12566,sulfates polysaccharides extract of u lactuca ameliorate hepatic enzymatic catalase glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase non enzymatic reduced glutathione total thiol antioxidant defenses and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
12567,in conclusion the tested u lactuca polysaccharides extract has potent hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant effects in experimentally induced hypercholesterolemic animal model
12568,pancreatic cancer is the one of most common causes of cancer deaths and has the worst prognosis
12569,clinical observational studies suggest that statins may reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer
12570,the chemopreventive efficacy of the statin atorvastatin lipitor and the role of the phosphatidyl inositol kinase pi akt signaling pathway were evaluated for the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms panins to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac in conditional p cre lsl kras gd transgenic mice
12571,six week old male p cre lsl kras gd group mice were fed ain a diets containing and ppm atorvastatin for weeks
12572,at termination pancreata were evaluated histopathologically for panins and pdac and for various pi akt signaling markers and inflammatory cytokines by immunohistochemistry immunohistoflourscence elisa western blotting and or reverse transcription pcr methods
12573,control diet fed mice showed incidence of pdac whereas mice fed with atorvastatin showed pdac incidence of and respectively p
12574,similarly significant suppression of panin was observed in mice fed ppm atorvastatin
12575,importantly pancreata from atorvastatin treated mice were free from ductal lesions
12576,furthermore pancreas of mice administered with atorvastatin had significantly reduced expressions levels of pcna px p erk rhoa cyclin d survivin akt pakt catenin cyclin e cdk and caveolin
12577,also atorvastatin treated mice had shown dose dependent suppression of inflammatory cytokines and a significant increase in tunnel positive cells p and parp expression levels in pancreas
12578,atorvastatin significantly delays the progression of panin and lesions to panin and pdac by modulating pi akt signal molecules in a preclinical model suggesting potential clinical benefits of statins for high risk pancreatic cancer patients
12579,the aim of this research is to study the effects of traditional chinese medicine on endotoxin and its receptors in rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash
12580,fifty six sd rats were divided into seven groups
12581,all the animals were fed high fatty diet for weeks
12582,rats with non alcoholic steatohepatitis nash were treated with traditional chinese medicine according to low dose middle dose high dose and lipitor from fifth week
12583,all rats were killed at the end of th week
12584,the liver pathology changes were observed under light microscope
12585,the levels of serum lipoid alanine aminotransferase alt endotoxin et tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf alpha and interleukine beta il beta were determined
12586,the expressions of cd and nuclear transcriptional factor kappab nf kappab were observed by immunohistochemistry
12587,the expressions of lipopolysaccharide binding protein lbp toll like receptor tlr myeloid differentiation md and induced nitric oxide synthase inos mrna were detected by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr
12588,the levels of serum endotoxin in the middle dose group eu l were lower than those in high fatty diet model group eu l at th week the difference was significant p
12589,in the middle dose group mean values of serum tnf alpha and il beta levels decreased dramatically ng ml and ng ml compared with those in the high fatty diet model group ng ml and ng ml p and p
12590,the expressions of cd and nf kappab in the middle dose group decreased compared with those in the high fatty diet model group
12591,the expressions of lbp mrna and tlr mrna in the middle dose group down regulated compared with those in the high fatty diet model group and p and p
12592,in the middle dose group md and inos gene expressions were and respectively which were significantly lower compared with the high fatty diet model group and p and p
12593,the mechanism of non alcoholic steatohepatitis nash maybe related to increasing the levels of serum endotoxin upregulating endotoxin receptors of hepatic tissue and enhancing liver inflammatory injury
12594,traditional chinese medicine is a good treatment for non alcoholic steatohepatitis nash
12595,it can produce a marked effect via relieving lps induced liver injury
12596,the prodrug clopidogrel plavix is activated by cytochrome p p to a metabolite that inhibits adp induced platelet aggregation
12597,clopidogrel is frequently administered to patients in conjunction with the cypa substrate atorvastatin lipitor
12598,since clinical studies indicate that atorvastatin inhibits the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel we investigated whether cypa metabolized clopidogrel in vitro
12599,microsomes prepared from dexamethasone pretreated rats metabolized clopidogrel at a rate of nmol min nmol of p which is and faster than the rate of metabolism by microsomes from control and beta napthoflavone treated rats respectively
12600,to identify the human ps responsible for clopidogrel oxidation genetically engineered microsomes containing a single human p isozyme were tested for their ability to oxidize clopidogrel
12601,cypa and a metabolized clopidogrel at a significantly higher rate than eight other p isozymes suggesting that cypa and a are primarily responsible for in vivo clopidogrel metabolism
12602,clopidogrel interacts with human cypa with a spectral dissociation constant k s k m and v max of microm microm and nmol min nmol p respectively
12603,atorvastatin lactone the physiologically relevant substrate inhibits clopidogrel with a k i of microm
12604,when clopidogrel and atorvastatin are present at equimolar concentrations clopidogrel metabolism is inhibited by greater than
12605,since cypa and a metabolize clopidogrel faster than other human p isozymes and are the most abundant ps in human liver they are predicted to be predominantly responsible for the activation of clopidogrel in vivo
12606,plasma cholesterol and other lipoproteins play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease chd
12607,this year study was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin lipitor compared to pravastatin a marketed agent for low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c reduction in hypercholesterolemic patients
12608,patients were recruited at centers in six european countries
12609,after a week placebo baseline phase patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin mg or pravastatin mg daily
12610,the dose could be doubled at week if ldl c levels remained or mmol l mg dl
12611,atorvastatin significantly lowered ldl c from baseline by compared with for pravastatin p
12612,a total of of atorvastatin patients attained the ldl c target level of mmol l compared to of pravastatin patients
12613,atorvastatin also significantly reduced tc tg and apo b p
12614,safety was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring clinical laboratory parameters
12615,the adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups and neither treatment caused clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities
12616,atorvastatin and mg once daily is superior to pravastatin and mg once daily in treating patients with hypercholesterolemia
12617,aldolases are emerging as powerful and cost efficient tools for the industrial synthesis of chiral molecules
12618,they catalyze enantioselective carbon carbon bond formations generating up to two chiral centers under mild reaction conditions
12619,despite their versatility narrow substrate ranges and enzyme inactivation under synthesis conditions represented major obstacles for large scale applications of aldolases
12620,in this study we applied directed evolution to optimize escherichia coli deoxy d ribose phosphate aldolase dera as biocatalyst for the industrial synthesis of r s chloro trideoxyhexapyranoside
12621,this versatile chiral precursor for vastatin drugs like lipitor atorvastatin is synthesized by dera in a tandem aldol reaction from chloroacetaldehyde and two acetaldehyde equivalents
12622,however e coli dera shows low affinity to chloroacetaldehyde and is rapidly inactivated at aldehyde concentrations useful for biocatalysis
12623,using high throughput screenings for chloroacetaldehyde resistance and for higher productivity several improved variants have been identified
12624,by combination of the most beneficial mutations we obtained a tenfold improved variant compared to wild type dera with regard to r s chloro trideoxyhexapyranoside synthesis under industrially relevant conditions
12625,deoxyribose phosphate aldolase dera ec catalyzes the reversible aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and d glyceraldehyde phosphate to generate d deoxyribose phosphate
12626,it is unique among the aldolases as it catalyzes the reversible asymmetric aldol addition reaction of two aldehydes
12627,in order to expand the substrate scope and stereoselectivity of dera structure based substrate design as well as site specific mutation has been investigated
12628,using the a crystal structure of dera in complex with its natural substrate as a guide five site directed mutants were designed in order to improve its activity with the unnatural nonphosphorylated substrate d deoxyribose
12629,of these the sd variant exhibited a fold improvement over the wild type enzyme in the retroaldol reaction of deoxyribose
12630,interestingly this sd mutant enzyme was shown to accept azidopropinaldehyde as a substrate in a sequential asymmetric aldol reaction to form a deoxy azidoethyl pyranose which is a precursor to the corresponding lactone and the cholesterol lowering agent lipitor
12631,this azidoaldehyde is not a substrate for the wild type enzyme
12632,another structure based design of new nonphosphorylated substrates was focused on the aldol reaction with inversion in enantioselectivity using the wild type or the sd variant as the catalyst and methyl substituted aldehydes as substrates
12633,an example was demonstrated in the asymmetric synthesis of a deoxypyranose as a new effective synthon for the total synthesis of epothilones
12634,in addition to facilitate the discovery of new enzymatic reactions the engineered e coli strain select deltaace adhc de was developed to be used in the future for selection of dera variants with novel nonphosphorylated acceptor specificity
12635,direct to consumer advertising dtca of prescription drugs is the most common form of health communication americans are exposed to
12636,the effects of dtca on prescription requests and utilization are well established but little is known about the effects of advertisements on health behaviors
12637,many advertisements especially those promoting drugs to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease refer to lifestyle change as a way to improve health
12638,however no studies have examined how consumers interpret these frequently ambiguous messages
12639,we used in depth interviews with participants recruited in los angeles usa between april and july to explore perceptions of advertisements for drugs that prevent or treat cardiovascular disease lipitor vytorin zetia caduet plavix
12640,we found that participants interpreted advertising messages within their own life context and identified four trajectories for enacting behavior change versus taking prescription drugs negotiators avoiders embracers and jumpstarters
12641,underlying these four typologies were beliefs about whether lifestyle change was something an individual could do or was willing to do
12642,our results also show how an advertisement narrative could potentially shift perceptions of causality by suggesting that high cholesterol is primarily hereditary thereby obviating the need for lifestyle change
12643,some participants stated that they would prefer lifestyle change to a particular prescription drug but felt that others would be more likely to embrace taking a prescription drug
12644,this third person effect may be masking participants intentions by identifying a more socially desirable route to therapeutic change
12645,these findings raise questions about how the typologies are distributed in the population and how advertising may shift consumers beliefs over time thereby contributing to new forms of medicalization
12646,effective regulation of dtca may require expanding scrutiny beyond the accuracy of claims about benefits and risks to also considering the broader narratives in which these claims are made
12647,to investigate the effect of atorvastatin lipitor a commonly used drug for dyslipidaemia in experimental autoimmune uveitis eau
12648,b riii mice were immunised with human interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein irbp peptide p
12649,they were divided into three groups of each and treated orally once daily for days group one received phosphate buffered saline control group group two received mg kg of atorvastatin low dose group and group three received mg kg high dose
12650,on day lymph nodes spleens and right eyes were harvested
12651,rna was extracted from lymph nodes for rnase protection assay rpa to determine proinflammatory il alpha and il beta th tnf alpha il il and th il il and il cytokine levels
12652,protein was extracted from spleens for western blot to detect the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription stat and stat
12653,the severity of inflammation in enucleated eyes was graded by a masked observer
12654,paired t test was performed for the mean difference in histological scoring between treated groups and the immunised control group
12655,surprisingly atorvastatin did not modulate the immune response
12656,the proinflammatory cytokines il alpha and il beta and th cytokines tnf alpha and il were upregulated equally in control and atorvastatin treated groups
12657,il and th cytokines were not upregulated in all three groups
12658,western blot analysis showed high levels of phosphorylated stat but not stat protein in the control and atorvastatin treated groups
12659,mean differences in histological scoring between treated groups and the immunised control group were not statistically significant
12660,atorvastatin treatment had no effect on th and th cytokine transcription
12661,although histological grading suggested mildly decreased inflammation in the high dose treated group the equivalence of cytokine expression in all groups suggests that the statins may not modulate irbp induced uveoretinitis
12662,the present study investigated the possible synergistic inhibitory effect of a novel combination of polyphenon e ppe a standardized green tea polyphenol preparation and atorvastatin trade name lipitor in a mouse tumorigenesis model and in human lung cancer h and h cell lines
12663,female a j mice were given two weekly i p
12664,injections of methylnitrosaminao pyridyl butanone mg kg total dose week later mice were treated with ppe or in drinking fluid atorvastatin or ppm in diet or ppe plus atorvastatin ppm for weeks
12665,the interaction of these two agents was also studied in human lung cancer h and h cells
12666,the individual agents ppe or atorvastatin were not effective in inhibiting lung tumorigenesis
12667,the low dose combination of ppe and atorvastatin however significantly reduced both the tumor multiplicity and tumor burden by and respectively p
12668,isobologram analysis of the interaction of the two agents indicated that the combination synergistically decreased tumor multiplicity p and tumor burden p
12669,the inhibition was associated with enhanced apoptosis and suppressed myeloid cell leukemia mcl level in adenoma as determined by immunohistochemistry and western blots
12670,treatment with combinations of ppe and atorvastatin also synergistically decreased the number of viable h and h cells as determined by isobologram analysis
12671,this synergistic effect was associated with increased apoptosis as determined by the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase mediated nick end labeling assay
12672,the combination of ppe and atorvastatin was more efficient in reducing the antiapoptotic protein mcl level and increasing the cleaved caspase and cleaved poly adp ribose polymerase level than the single agent treatment
12673,the present work showed that ppe and atorvastatin synergistically inhibited methylnitrosaminao pyridyl butanone induced lung tumorigenesis in mice and the growth of lung cancer h and h cells possibly through enhanced apoptosis
12674,the results provide leads for future research on the application of this combination for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer
12675,statins have recently been shown to exert neuronal protection in ischemic stroke
12676,reactive oxygen species specifically superoxide formed during the early phase of reperfusion augment neuronal injury
12677,nadph oxidase is a key enzyme for superoxide production
12678,the present study tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin protects against cerebral infarction via inhibition of nadph oxidase derived superoxide in transient focal ischemia
12679,transient focal ischemia was created in halothane anesthetized adult male sprague dawley rats g by middle cerebral artery occlusion mcao
12680,atorvastatin lipitor mg kg sc was administered three times before mcao
12681,infarct volume was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining
12682,nadph oxidase enzymatic activity and superoxide levels were quantified in the ischemic core and penumbral regions by lucigenin microm enhanced chemiluminescence
12683,expression of nadph oxidase membrane subunit gp phox and membrane translocated subunit p phox and small gtpase rac was analyzed by western blot
12684,nadph oxidase activity and superoxide levels increased after reperfusion and peaked within h of reperfusion in the penumbra but not in the ischemic core in mcao rats
12685,atorvastatin pretreatment prevented these increases blunted expression of membrane subunit gp phox and prevented translocation of cytoplasmic subunit p phox to the membrane in the penumbra h after reperfusion
12686,consequently cerebral infarct volume was significantly reduced in atorvastatin treated compared with nontreated mcao rats h after reperfusion
12687,these results indicate that atorvastatin protects against cerebral infarction via inhibition of nadph oxidase derived superoxide in transient focal ischemia
12688,background atorvastatin calcium lipitor is a new hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitor
12689,the present study was conducted to examine the effect of pronounced cholesterol lowering on adrenal function in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia
12690,methods and results adrenal function was examined under basal conditions and following adrenal corticotropin hormone stimulation in patients with heterogeneous familial and with polygenic hypercholesterolemia
12691,the study was part of a larger study comparing the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin colestipol atorvastatin colestipol and simvastatin colestipol treatment over a year period
12692,maximum doses of all agents were studied mg atorvastatin once daily mg simvastatin once daily and g day colestipol
12693,at the end of the year treatment period reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol were and for the atorvastatin colestipol atorvastatin and colestipol simvastatin groups respectively
12694,no clinically significant changes in basal serum cortisol levels were seen in any treatment group during the year treatment period
12695,mean serum cortisol concentrations and area under the curve for cortisol concentration versus time data following adrenal corticotropin hormone stimulation were not clinically different during treatment compared with values obtained at baseline for any of the treatment groups
12696,conclusions treatment with maximum doses of atorvastatin for year did not have any adverse effects on adrenal function under basal conditions or during maximum stimulation
12697,similarly colestipol therapy alone and in combination with either atorvastatin or simvastatin did not appear to affect adrenal function
12698,medication errors occur frequently and poor medication labeling is cited as a potential cause
12699,we assessed the format content and variability of prescription drug container labels dispensed in the community
12700,identically written prescriptions for commonly used medications atorvastatin calcium lipitor alendronate sodium fosamax trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole bactrim and ibuprofen were filled in pharmacies the largest chains grocery stores and independent pharmacies in cities boston chicago los angeles and austin texas
12701,characteristics of the format and content of the main container label and auxiliary stickers were evaluated
12702,labels were coded independently by abstractors and differences were reconciled by consensus
12703,we evaluated labels after excluding ibuprofen prescriptions that were filled with over the counter containers that lacked labels printed at the pharmacy
12704,the pharmacy name or logo was the most prominent item on of the labels with a mean font size of point
12705,font sizes were smaller for medication instructions point medication name point and warning and instruction stickers point
12706,color boldfacing and highlighting were most often used to identify the pharmacy and items most useful to pharmacists
12707,while the content of the main label was generally consistent there was substantial variability in the content of instruction and warning stickers from different pharmacies and independent pharmacies were less likely to use such stickers p
12708,none of the ibuprofen containers were delivered with food and drug administration approved medication guides as required by law
12709,the format of most container labels emphasizes pharmacy characteristics and items frequently used by pharmacists rather than use instructions or medication warnings
12710,the content of warning and instruction stickers is highly variable depending on the pharmacy selected
12711,statins hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitors which are approved for cholesterol reduction may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases
12712,atorvastatin lipitor was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis a cd th mediated central nervous system cns demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis
12713,here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis
12714,atorvastatin induced stat phosphorylation and secretion of th cytokines interleukin il il and il and transforming growth factor tgf beta
12715,conversely stat phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of th cytokines il il interferon ifn gamma and tumour necrosis factor tnf alpha was suppressed
12716,atorvastatin promoted differentiation of th cells into th cells
12717,in adoptive transfer these th cells protected recipient mice from eae induction
12718,atorvastatin reduced cns infiltration and major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii expression
12719,treatment of microglia inhibited ifn gamma inducible transcription at multiple mhc class ii transactivator ciita promoters and suppressed class ii upregulation
12720,atorvastatin suppressed ifn gamma inducible expression of cd cd and cd co stimulatory molecules
12721,l mevalonate the product of hmg coa reductase reversed atorvastatin s effects on antigen presenting cells apc and t cells
12722,atorvastatin treatment of either apc or t cells suppressed antigen specific t cell activation
12723,thus atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both apc and t cell compartments
12724,statins may be beneficial for multiple sclerosis and other th mediated autoimmune diseases
12725,epidemiology studies suggest that statins and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs reduce the risk of prostate cancer
12726,in the present study lncap cells were cultured in regular medium containing fetal bovine serum or in medium supplemented with charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum to mimic androgen deprivation treatment
12727,we found that atorvastatin lipitor or celecoxib celebrex treatment of lncap cells cultured in regular or androgen depleted medium inhibited growth and stimulated apoptosis
12728,a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib was more effective than either agent alone
12729,in animal studies severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected s c with lncap cells in matrigel
12730,after to weeks mice with lncap tumors about cm wide and cm long were surgically castrated and received daily i p
12731,injections of vehicle atorvastatin microg g body weight d celecoxib microg g d or a combination of atorvastatin microg g d and celecoxib microg g d for days
12732,in all groups the androgen dependent lncap tumors regressed initially in response to castration but the tumors eventually progressed to androgen independence and started to grow
12733,treatment of the mice with atorvastatin or celecoxib alone suppressed the regrowth of lncap tumors after castration
12734,a combination of low doses of atorvastatin and celecoxib had a more potent effect in inhibiting the growth and progression of lncap tumors to androgen independence than a higher dose of either agent alone
12735,our results indicate that administration of a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib may be an effective strategy for the prevention of prostate cancer progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence
12736,to assess the effect of pharmaceutical advertising embedded in clinical software on the prescribing behaviour of general practitioners
12737,secondary analysis of data from a random sample of australian gps who participated in bettering the evaluation and care of health a national continuous cross sectional survey of general practice activity between november and march the prescribing behaviour of participants who used the advertising software was compared with that of participants who did not for seven pharmaceutical products advertised continually throughout the study period
12738,prescription for advertised product as a proportion of prescriptions for all pharmaceutical products in the same generic class or group
12739,gp age practice location accreditation status patient bulk billing status and hours worked were significantly associated p with use of advertising software
12740,we found no significant differences either before or after adjustment for these confounders in the prescribing rate of lipitor adjusted odds ratio aor p micardis aor p mobic aor p norvasc aor p natrilix aor p or zanidip aor p
12741,gps using advertising software prescribed nexium significantly less often than those not using advertising software aor p
12742,when all advertised products were combined and compared with products that were not advertised no difference in the overall prescribing behaviour was demonstrated aor p
12743,exposure to advertisements in clinical software has little influence on the prescribing behaviour of gps
12744,spinal cord injury sci is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss axonal destruction and demyelination at the site of impact
12745,the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase inos in exacerbation of sci pathology is well documented
12746,we have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins hydroxy methylglutaryl hmg coa reductase inhibitors in the animal model of multiple sclerosis experimental allergic encephalitis eae
12747,the present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin lipitor lp treatment in attenuating sci induced pathology
12748,immunohistochemical detection and real time pcr analysis showed increased expression of inos tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfalpha and interleukin beta il beta after sci
12749,in addition neuronal apoptosis was detected hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ed positive inflammatory infiltrates glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap positive reactive astrocytes and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by week after sci relative to control
12750,lp treatment attenuated the sci induced inos tnfalpha and il beta expression
12751,lp also provided protection against sci induced tissue necrosis neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis demyelination and reactive gliosis
12752,furthermore rats treated with lp scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after sci than did untreated rats
12753,this study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of sci related pathology and disability
12754,preclinical and clinical studies have established evidence that cyclooxygenase cox inhibitors and statins hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase hmgr inhibitors inhibit colon carcinogenesis
12755,chronic use of high doses of cox inhibitors may induce side effects and combining the low doses of agents may be an effective way to increase their efficacy and minimize the side effects
12756,we assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of atorvastatin lipitor and celecoxib individually or in combination in an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis
12757,six week old male cbl j apcmin mice were either fed diets containing or ppm atorvastatin or ppm celecoxib or a combination of both for approximately days
12758,mice were sacrificed and their intestines were scored for tumors
12759,normal seeming mucosa and intestinal tumors were harvested and assayed for apoptosis terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling and hmgr and cox protein expression and activity
12760,we observed that ppm atorvastatin significantly p suppressed intestinal polyp formation
12761,as anticipated ppm celecoxib decreased the rate of formation of intestinal polyps by approximately p
12762,importantly the combination of ppm atorvastatin and ppm celecoxib in the diet suppressed the colon polyps completely and small intestinal polyps by p compared with the control group
12763,the inhibition of tumor formation by the atorvastatin and celecoxib combination was significant p when compared with tumor inhibition by celecoxib alone
12764,in addition increased rates of apoptosis in intestinal tumors p were observed in animals fed with atorvastatin and celecoxib and more so with the combinations
12765,tumors of animals fed atorvastatin showed a significant decrease in hmgr r activity
12766,similarly tumors of mice exposed to celecoxib showed significantly lower levels of cox activity
12767,these observations show that atorvastatin inhibits intestinal tumorigenesis and that importantly when given together with low doses of celecoxib it significantly increases the chemopreventive efficacy in an apc min mice
12768,the influence of the phenolic hydroxyl group of ortho hydroxy atorvastatin metabolite ato oh on the photochemistry of atorvastatin ato has been evaluated by steady and time resolved experiments
12769,direct excitation of ato and ato oh led to phenanthrene like intermediate formation being for ato oh less efficient than that for its parent compound in methanol
12770,both ato and ato oh are able to quench benzophenone e t kcal mol and xanthone e t kcal mol triplet excited state with rate constants close to diffusion limit control which suggest energy transfer mechanism is taking place
12771,in fact lower triplet energies kcal mol and character were confirmed by dft calculations for both compounds
12772,interestingly only ato oh can act as a hydrogen donor towards triplet benzil excited state e t kcal mol due to the presence of the phenolic hydroxyl group
12773,nevertheless the presence of this group in ato oh does not modify to a significant degree the compound reactivity toward singlet oxygen
12774,the importance of triplet energy transfer in biological systems to form ato and ato oh triplet excited state as well as the hydrogen donor capacity of ato oh toward triplet excited state are discussed in the present communication
12775,preclinical and clinical studies have provided evidence that aspirin celecoxib cyclooxygenase inhibitor and statins hydroxy methylglutaryl coa reductase inhibitors inhibit colon carcinogenesis
12776,chronic use of high doses of these agents may induce side effects in ostensibly normal individuals
12777,combining low doses of agents may be an effective way to increase their efficacy and minimize toxicity
12778,we assessed the efficacy of atorvastatin lipitor celecoxib and aspirin given individually at high dose levels and in combination at lower doses against azoxymethane induced colon carcinogenesis in male f rats
12779,one day after the last azoxymethane treatment mg kg body weight s c once weekly for weeks groups of male f rats were fed the ain a diet or ain a diet containing ppm atorvastatin ppm celecoxib and ppm aspirin ppm atorvastatin ppm celecoxib and ppm atorvastatin ppm aspirin
12780,rats were killed weeks later and colon tumors were processed histopathologically and analyzed for cell proliferation and apoptosis immunohistochemically
12781,administration of these agents individually and in combination significantly suppressed the incidence and multiplicity of colon adenocarcinomas
12782,low doses of these agents in combination inhibited colon carcinogenesis more effectively than when they were given individually at higher doses
12783,inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by these agents is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis in colon tumors
12784,these observations are of clinical significance because this can pave the way for the use of combinations of these agents in small doses against colon cancer
12785,to examine how pharmacy bargaining activities affect reimbursement rates in medicare part d prescription drug plan pdp contracts controlling for pharmacy quality attributes market structures and area socioeconomic status
12786,cross sectional study
12787,six medicare regions throughout the united states between october and december
12788,random sample of independent pharmacies returned surveys containing sufficient responses for analysis
12789,pharmacies were surveyed regarding pdp reimbursement rates costs and cash prices of two popular prescription drugs atorvastatin calcium lipitor pfizer and lisinopril month supply of a common strength as well as pharmacy bargaining activities and quality attributes
12790,data also were used from the national council for prescription drug programs pharmacy database the u s census and the economic census on local market structures and area socio economic status
12791,pdp reimbursement rates
12792,for the brand name drug atorvastatin calcium the pdp reimbursement was positively related to a pharmacy s request for a contract change p whereas other bargaining activities were not significantly related to pdp reimbursement
12793,however for the generic drug lisinopril no bargaining activities were found to be significantly related to the pdp reimbursement
12794,pharmacy request for a contract change was associated with higher reimbursement rates for the brand name drug atorvastatin calcium in pdp contracts after controlling for pharmacy quality attributes local market structures and area socioeconomic status this finding likely applies to other brand name drugs because of the structure of the contracts
12795,our results suggest that independent pharmacies are more likely to acquire higher reimbursement rates by engaging in active bargaining with third party payers
12796,thyroid receptors tralpha and trbeta are involved in important physiological functions such as metabolism cholesterol level and heart activities
12797,whereas metabolism increase and cholesterol level lowering could be achieved by trbeta isoform activation tralpha activation affects heart rates
12798,therefore beta selective thyromimetics have been developed as promising drug candidates for treatment of obesity and elevated cholesterol level
12799,gc dimethyl hydroxy isopropylbenzyl phenoxy acetic acid has ability to lower ldl cholesterol with to fold more potency and approximately two to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin lipitor c in studies in rats mice and monkeys
12800,to investigate gc specificity we solved crystal structures and performed molecular dynamics simulations of both isoforms complexed with gc
12801,crystal structures reveal that in tralpha arg is observed in multiple conformations an effect triggered by the differences in the interactions between gc and ser or the corresponding asparagine asn of trbeta
12802,the corresponding arg of trbeta is observed in only one single stable conformation interacting effectively with the ligand
12803,molecular dynamics support this model our simulations show that the multiple conformations can be observed for the arg in tralpha in which the ligand interacts either strongly with the ligand or with the ser residue
12804,in contrast a single stable arg conformation is observed for trbeta in which it strongly interacts with both gc and the asn
12805,our analysis suggests that the key factors for gc selectivity are the presence of an oxyacetic acid ester oxygen and the absence of the amino group relative to t
12806,these results shed light into the beta selectivity of gc and may assist the development of new compounds with potential as drug candidates to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and obesity
12807,antibody titers to heat shock protein hsp and are positively related to risk of vascular disease and cardiovascular endpoints
12808,there are few data on the factors that regulate the levels of these antibodies
12809,it is known that the statins have antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory properties
12810,the authors examined the effects of statins simvastatin zocor and atorvastatin lipitor on antibody titers to hsp and in a group of dyslipidemic patients
12811,twenty patients attending a lipid clinic and previously not receiving lipid lowering treatment were treated with mg of simvastatin n or atorvastatin n for months
12812,an additional patients were recruited from the same clinic at the same hospital as a control group
12813,the medication of these latter patients was unaltered for months and the same parameters were measured as for the statin group
12814,antibody titers to hsp and were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and lipoprotein profile and highly sensitive serum c reactive protein crp were measured by routine methods before and after treatment
12815,pretreatment and posttreatment data were compared by paired t or mann whitney tests
12816,overall statin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in median antibody titers to hsp p hsp p and hsp p but not in control patients
12817,both statins caused a reduction in median serum crp concentrations overall p but significant changes were not observed in the control patients
12818,the effects on hsp antibody titers were not related to changes in serum crp concentrations p
12819,however there was a significant correlation between changes in antibody titers to hsp vs hsp p hsp vs hsp p and hsp vs hsp p
12820,statin treatment was associated with a reduction in antibody titers to hsp and this reduction is not fully explained by the antiinflammatory effects of the statins but may be due to their other immunomodulatory properties
12821,the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways produce the largest class of small molecules in nature isoprenoids also called terpenoids
12822,not surprisingly then isoprenoid biosynthesis is a target for drug discovery and many drugs such as lipitor used to lower cholesterol fosamax used to treat osteoporosis and many anti infectives target isoprenoid biosynthesis
12823,however drug resistance in malaria tuberculosis and staph infections is rising cheap and effective drugs for the neglected tropical diseases are lacking and progress in the development of anticancer drugs is relatively slow
12824,isoprenoid biosynthesis is thus an attractive target and in this account i describe developments in four areas using in each case knowledge derived from one area of chemistry to guide the development of inhibitors or drug leads in another seemingly unrelated area
12825,first i describe mechanistic studies of the enzyme isph which is present in malaria parasites and most pathogenic bacteria but not in humans
12826,isph is a fe s protein and produces the five carbon c isoprenoids ipp isopentenyl diphosphate and dmapp dimethylallyl diphosphate from hmbpp e hydroxy methyl but enyl diphosphate via a h e reduction of an allyl alcohol to an alkene
12827,the mechanism is unusual in that it involves organometallic species metallacycles alkenes and allyls
12828,these observations lead to novel alkyne inhibitors which also form metallacycles
12829,second i describe structure function inhibition studies of fpp synthase the macromolecule that condenses ipp and dmapp to the sesquiterpene farnesyl diphosphate fpp in a head to tail manner
12830,this enzyme uses a carbocation mechanism and is potently inhibited by bone resorption drugs bisphosphonates which i show are also antiparasitic agents that block sterol biosynthesis in protozoa
12831,moreover lipophilic bisphosphonates inhibit protein prenylation and invasiveness in tumor cells in addition to activating t cells to kill tumor cells and are important new leads in oncology
12832,third i describe structural and inhibition studies of a head to head triterpene synthase dehydrosqualene synthase crtm from staphylococcus aureus
12833,crtm catalyzes the first committed step in biosynthesis of the carotenoid virulence factor staphyloxanthin the condensation of two fpp molecules to produce a cyclopropane presqualene diphosphate
12834,the structure of crtm is similar to that of human squalene synthase sqs and some sqs inhibitors originally developed as cholesterol lowering drugs block staphyloxanthin biosynthesis
12835,treated bacteria are white and nonvirulent because they lack the carotenoid shield that protects them from reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils rendering them susceptible to innate immune system clearance a new therapeutic approach
12836,and finally i show that the heart drug amiodarone also known to have antifungal activity blocks ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of oxidosqualene cyclase in trypanosoma cruzi work that has led to its use in the clinic as a novel antiparasitic agent
12837,in each of these four examples i use information from one area organometallic chemistry bone resorption drugs cholesterol lowering agents heart disease to develop drug leads in an unrelated area a knowledge based approach that represents an important advance in the search for new drugs
12838,lipid lowering statins are thought to have a favorable safety profile
12839,statins inhibit hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase the rate limiting step of mevalonate synthesis
12840,mevalonate is the substrate for further synthesis of cholesterol and co enzyme q coq
12841,coq plays an important role during oxidative phosphorylation in the myocardial cell
12842,since myocardial diastolic function is a highly atp dependent we reasoned that early changes of diastolic function may be an early marker of ventricular dysfunction
12843,patients who are to commence on statin therapy will be enrolled in the trial
12844,baseline measurements of plasma coq total cholesterol ldl hdl coq ldl ratio peak e peak a velocities e a ratio deceleration time isovolumetric relaxation time color m mode propagation velocity will be performed and patients will then begin to take oral atorvastatin lipitor parke davis mg daily for three to six months
12845,all baseline measurement will be repeated after to months of statin therapy
12846,those patients demonstrating measurement of diastolic lv function that worsened during the to months of statin therapy will be supplemented with coq mg daily for months
12847,a followup echocardiogram and blood coq level will be measured in patients who received coq supplementation
12848,statistical analysis will be performed using the paired t test to compare coenzyme levels and echocardiographic indices at baseline and after treatment and after supplementation
12849,hmg coa reductase inhibitor drugs or statins have been shown to effectively reduce plasma total cholesterol chol chol associated with low density lipoprotein ldl and triglycerides tg
12850,in addition slight elevations in hdl chol are also typically observed
12851,poloxamer p a nonionic surfactant effectively elevates both plasma chol and especially tg in a dose controlled fashion and results in formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the aortas of cbl mice without the requirement of dietary cholic acid
12852,the purpose of the present study was to assess whether a typical statin namely atorvastatin lipitor r would significantly reduce p induced hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia as well as cause regression of atherosclerotic lesions resulting from administration of p to cbl mice
12853,cbl mice in the present study were treated with either normal saline c controls g kg of p p or a high fat high cholesterol cholate containing diet hf for days
12854,mice in all groups were then equally and randomly divided and treated with either atorvastatin or saline for an additional days
12855,beginning at day and using mice in groups p and hf as an example one fourth of the mice in each group received mg kg per day of atorvastatin with either concomitant hf feeding or p administration progression treatment groups one fourth received mg kg per day of atorvastatin following cessation of hf feeding or p administration one fourth received saline placebo with either simultaneous hf feeding or p administration progression placebo groups and one fourth received saline placebo following cessation of hf feeding or p administration
12856,total plasma chol was significantly p lower for mice in groups p and hf when administered atorvastatin relative to saline but remained significantly p elevated compared to total plasma chol of c mice
12857,with discontinuation of either p administration or hf feeding total plasma chol declined rapidly in both p and hf mice with atorvastatin treated mice generally demonstrating lower plasma chol concentrations relative to saline treated mice
12858,total plasma tg was significantly p lower for mice in group p administered atorvastatin relative to saline but remained significantly p elevated compared to plasma tg of c mice
12859,with discontinuation of p administration total plasma tg declined rapidly in p mice with atorvastatin treated mice typically demonstrating lower plasma tg concentrations relative to saline treated p mice
12860,aortas of mice treated with mg kg per day of atorvastatin in both groups p and hf whether maintained on the hf diet or treated with p from day to or whether each treatment was terminated at day revealed no presence of atherosclerotic lesions relative to saline treated mice and were indistinguishable from aortas retrieved from c mice
12861,atorvastatin at a dose of mg kg per day not only significantly reduced the plasma chol and tg concentrations but also resulted in regression of atherosclerotic lesions induced in cbl mice by administration of p or ingestion of a hf diet containing cholic acid
12862,alzheimer s disease ad is a neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia in the elderly
12863,the two hallmark lesions in ad brain are deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles nfts
12864,hypercholesteremia is one of the risk factors of ad
12865,but its role in the pathogenesis of ad is largely unknown
12866,the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between hypercholesteremia and tau phosphorylation or beta amyloid abeta and evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on the level of tau phosphorylation and abeta in the brains of rats fed with high cholesterol diet
12867,sprague dawley sd rats were randomly divided into normal diet control group high cholesterol diet group and high cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin lipitor mg x kg x d treated group
12868,blood from caudal vein was collected to measure total cholesterol tc triglyceride tg low density lipoprotein ldl and high density lipoprotein hdl at the end of the rd and the th months by an enzymatic method
12869,the animals were sacrificed months later and brains were removed
12870,all left brain hemispheres were fixed for immunohistochemistry
12871,hippocampus and cerebral cortex were separated from right hemispheres and homogenized separately
12872,tau phosphorylation and abeta in the brain tissue were determined by western blotting using antibodies phf and tau and anti abeta anti abeta respectively
12873,we found that high cholesterol diet led to hypercholesteremia of rats as well as hyperphosphorylation of tau and increased abeta level in the brains
12874,treatment of the high cholesterol diet fed rats with atorvastatin prevented the changes of both tau phosphorylation and abeta level induced by high cholesterol diet
12875,hypercholesteremia could induce tau hyperphosphorylation and abeta production in rat brain
12876,atorvastatin could inhibit tau hyperphosphorylation and decrease abeta generation
12877,it may play a protective role in the patho process of hypercholesteremia induced neurodegeneration in the brain
12878,atorvastatin lipitor was developed as an inhibitor of hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase for treatment of serum lipid disorders
12879,other reductase inhibitors ris induce cataracts in dogs exposed to relatively high levels of the drugs for extended periods of time
12880,the purpose of these studies was to assess the cataractogenic potential of atorvastatin when administered for up to years in beagle dogs
12881,atorvastatin was administered at doses up to mg kg day in week week or week studies
12882,a week interim sacrifice and a reversal group in which dosing was terminated at week and the dogs sacrificed at week was included in the week study
12883,serum cholesterol was significantly lowered in all studies
12884,no clinical or histologic evidence of drug induced cataracts was found in any study
12885,lens biochemical analyses in the week study revealed no statistically significant changes in lenticular weight reduced or oxidized glutathione content adenosine nucleotide content glucose phosphate dehydrogenase activity or phosphofructokinase activity in any treatment group
12886,modest and transient decreases in lens protein potassium and glucose content were noted in the week study and at week glucose only in the week study at the doses or mg kg
12887,these studies demonstrated that in spite of marked reduction in serum cholesterol atorvastatin was not cataractogenic in dogs at any tested dose
12888,we conclude that atorvastatin differs from other ris in this regard
12889,background the effect of atorvastatin calcium lipitor parke davis morris plains nj on the crystalline lenses of hypercholesterolemic patients was evaluated and compared with that of lovastatin after weeks of treatment to reduce cholesterol levels
12890,methods and results six hundred ninety six atorvastatin treated and lovastatin treated patients completed a large safety study that included an ophthalmologic examination
12891,efficacy was evaluated as mean percent change from baseline in low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol
12892,patients received atorvastatin or mg or lovastatin or mg once daily for either or weeks
12893,patients were evaluated by slit lamp examination and a standardized format was used to describe the findings
12894,best corrected visual acuity was measured using the snellen chart
12895,patients treated with atorvastatin had significantly p greater decreases in ldl cholesterol than those treated with lovastatin vs
12896,although some patients in both groups experienced various lenticular opacities none were considered unexpected
12897,in addition there were no significant p differences in the distribution of cortical opacities and spokes right eye od and left eye os and posterior subcapsular opacity os between the atorvastatin and lovastatin groups
12898,in general the percent deterioration in best corrected visual acuity was similar in both groups
12899,overall there were no clinically significant differences in the development of lenticular opacity between patients treated with atorvastatin and those treated with lovastatin
12900,conclusions treatment with atorvastatin or mg significantly reduced ldl cholesterol p and was not associated with an increased risk of lenticular opacity development compared with lovastatin a widely prescribed compound in the same class of drugs
12901,the effects of atorvastatin lipitor were evaluated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia fh
12902,following a week drug free baseline period male and female patients were treated with atorvastatin mg once daily qd for the initial weeks increasing to mg qd during the following weeks
12903,atorvastatin and mg resulted in a dose related reduction in ldl cholesterol of and p respectively
12904,the reduction of triglycerides tg was p with and mg atorvastatin
12905,the lipoprotein lipase and the hepatic lipase activity decreased dose independently by p and p respectively
12906,in males a dose independent increase in high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol concentration was observed of p
12907,in females the hdl cholesterol concentration did not change
12908,baseline ldl size in the females was significantly larger than in the males being a and a p respectively
12909,in males ldl size increased significantly from a at baseline to a at mg p and to a p at mg atorvastatin
12910,in females ldl size did not change upon treatment with atorvastatin and mg qd
12911,in conclusion atorvastatin has the ability to decrease cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations as well as the activity of both lipoprotein and hepatic lipase activity
12912,additionally it has a favorable effect on ldl size and hdl cholesterol concentration in male but not in female fh patients
12913,chemvassa a new chemical structure search technology was developed to allow rapid in silico screening of compounds for hit and hit to lead identification in drug development
12914,it functions by using a novel type of molecular descriptor that examines in part the structure of the small molecule undergoing analysis yielding its information signature
12915,this descriptor takes into account the atoms bonds and their positions in dimensional space
12916,for the present study a database of chemvassa molecular descriptors was generated for nearly million compounds from the zinc database and other compound sources then an algorithm was developed that allows rapid similarity searching of the database using a query molecular descriptor e g the signature of atorvastatin below
12917,a scoring metric then allowed ranking of the search results
12918,we used these tools to search a subset of drug like molecules using the signature of a commercially successful statin atorvastatin lipitor
12919,the search identified ten novel compounds two of which have been demonstrated to interact with hmg coa reductase the macromolecular target of atorvastatin
12920,in particular one compound discussed in the results section tested successfully with an ic of less than um and a completely novel structure relative to known inhibitors
12921,interactions were validated using computational molecular docking and an hmg coa reductase activity assay
12922,the rapidity and low cost of the methodology and the novel structure of the interactors suggests this is a highly favorable new method for hit generation
12923,monotherapy with lipid modifying medication is frequently insufficient to normalize lipid abnormalities in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and type diabetes mellitus
12924,to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenofibric acid statin combination therapy in this population
12925,a pooled subgroup analysis of three randomized controlled double blind week trials

12928,fenofibric acid trilipix mg monotherapy low moderate or high dose statin monotherapy rosuvastatin crestor or mg simvastatin zocor or mg or atorvastatin lipitor or mg or fenofibric acid low or moderate dose statin
12929,mean percentage changes in lipid parameters percentages of patients achieving optimal serum lipid apolipoprotein levels and incidence of adverse events
12930,fenofibric acid low dose statin resulted in significantly p greater mean percentage changes in high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c and triglycerides than low dose statin monotherapy and respectively and significantly p greater reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c than fenofibric acid monotherapy
12931,similarly fenofibric acid moderate dose statin resulted in significantly p or greater mean percentage changes in hdl c and triglycerides than moderate dose statin monotherapy and respectively and significantly p greater reductions in ldl c than fenofibric acid monotherapy
12932,compared with low or moderate dose statin fenofibric acid low or moderate dose statin resulted in over fold higher percentages of patients achieving optimal levels of ldl c non hdl c apolipoprotein b hdl c and triglycerides simultaneously
12933,incidence of adverse events was generally similar among treatments
12934,fenofibric acid statin combination therapy in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and type diabetes was well tolerated and resulted in more comprehensive improvement in the lipid apolipoprotein profile than either monotherapy
12935,clinical trials are registered at www clinicaltrials gov nct nct and nct
12936,the effects of atorvastatin lipitor on cholesterol rich and triglyceride rich lipoproteins were evaluated in this multicenter trial
12937,following a week baseline period patients with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels were treated with atorvastatin mg once daily qd for the initial weeks period increasing to mg qd for the following weeks period
12938,at both the and mg doses atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant reductions compared to pretreatment levels in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c total cholesterol tc very low density lipoprotein cholesterol vldl c apolipoprotein apo b apob in ldl ldl apo b apo b in vldl vldl apo b lipoprotein lp b lipoprotein b complex lpbc triglycerides tg low density lipoprotein triglycerides ldl tg very low density lipoprotein triglyceride vldl tg high density lipoprotein triglycerides hdl tg and apo c iii
12939,atorvastatin and mg qd also resulted in significant increases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c apo ai and lpaii b c d e due to its unique ability to normalize both cholesterol rich and triglyceride rich particles atorvastatin is a promising candidate for monotherapy in a broad range of patients including those with varying degrees of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia
12940,we directly compared the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients
12941,this year randomized double blind study was performed at community and university based research hospitals in australia
12942,one hundred seventy seven patients between the ages of and years with baseline low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol or and or mmol l and mg dl respectively and triglycerides or mmol l mg dl received once daily dosing with atorvastatin lipitor mg or simvastatin zocor mg at week the dose of medication was titrated to atorvastatin mg or simvastatin mg if patients did not meet ldl cholesterol target of or mmol l mg dl
12943,efficacy was reported as percent change from baseline in ldl cholesterol total cholesterol very low density lipoprotein cholesterol total triglycerides high density lipoprotein cholesterol apolipoproteins ai and b and lipoprotein a
12944,atorvastatin caused significantly greater reductions from baseline than did simvastatin for ldl cholesterol total cholesterol very low density lipoprotein cholesterol triglycerides and apolipoprotein b p
12945,no patient in either treatment group had clinically important elevations in creatine phosphokinase alanine aminotransaminase or aspartate aminotransaminase
12946,no serious adverse events were considered associated with treatment
12947,with atorvastatin mg of the patients achieved ldl cholesterol target goal by week whereas only of the simvastatin patients achieved the target goal at the mg dose
12948,this cholesterol lowering profile affords utility in many patient types
12949,the present study evaluated the bioavailability and bioequivalence of fixed dose combination test formulation atorvastatin mg and aspirin mg capsule against marketed reference formulations lipitor tablets mg and nu seals tablets mg
12950,this study was an open label balanced randomized treatment period sequence single dose crossover trial in healthy adult human volunteers under fasting conditions
12951,plasma concentrations of atorvastatin aspirin and salicylic acid were quantified using lc ms ms method
12952,pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental model and mean pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between test and reference formulations
12953,the mean pharmacokinetic parameters auc t auc cmax cmax auc t and cmax auc for atorvastatin test and reference formulations were ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h and ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h respectively and for aspirin were ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h and ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h respectively
12954,where as for salicylic acid above parameters were ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h and ng h ml ng h ml ng ml h and h respectively for test and reference formulations
12955,the confidence intervals of atorvastatin and salicylic acid for auc t auc cmax cmax auc t and cmax auc parameters were found to be within the acceptable regulatory bioequivalence limits
12956,in conclusion the new fixed dose combination test formulation was bioequivalent to the reference formulations under fasting conditions
12957,in the calcium acetate renagel evaluation care study the effects of calcium acetate plus atorvastatin lipitor on the progression of coronary artery calcifications cacs are evaluated versus those of renagel monitored using dual electron beam tomography ebt scans two scans at study initiation and two at follow up
12958,the aim of this study is to estimate the interscan variation for the agatston score and for the volume score determined in patients with end stage renal disease esrd in the care study
12959,cac score and volume were measured at study initiation in esrd subjects mean age years female
12960,all patients underwent dual scanning using an ebt as first scan of two needed to measure the progression of cac when treated with sevelamer renagel compared with calcium acetate with or without atorvastatin
12961,all scans in all participants were completed by using an ebt system ge imatron south san francisco ca
12962,interscan variability was defined by the following formula abs scan a scan b x scan a x scan b x where a and b denote the first and second scan respectively of the dual scan procedure performed before treatment
12963,we evaluated the reproducibility of the cutpoints commonly used for calcium scores clinically namely and
12964,the cac interscan variability was using the agatston score and using the volume score
12965,the reproducibility was then assessed using cutpoints and
12966,agatston score variability for the four subgroups was and respectively mean variability
12967,volume score variability was and respectively mean variability
12968,the correlation coefficient for scan a to scan b goes up significantly with increasing calcium scores and reaches for scores greater than p
12969,interscan variability was sufficiently small for patients with calcium scores greater than our study thus demonstrates a sufficient reproducibility of the calcium score using ebt
12970,this score allows for accurate serial assessment of these patients and for comparing different therapies
12971,growing evidence suggests that elevated cholesterol levels in mid life are associated with increased risk of developing alzheimer s disease ad and that statins might have a protective effect against ad and dementia
12972,the lipitor s effect in alzheimer s dementia leade study tests the hypothesis that a statin atorvastatin mg daily will provide a benefit on the course of mild to moderate ad in patients receiving background therapy of a cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil mg daily
12973,this is an international multicenter double blind randomized parallel group study with a double blind randomized withdrawal phase of patients with mild to moderate ad mini mental state examination mmse score to

12980,leade will report in and is expected to provide a more definitive evaluation of the potential for statins in the treatment of people with ad
12981,effects of atorvastatin lipitor drug monotherapy mg daily on fasting blood lipid profiles and cardiovascular disease cvd risks were examined for a single subject with c c tetraplegia
12982,routine fasting lipid profiles were analyzed by standard biochemistry techniques for total cholesterol tc triglycerides tg low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c
12983,lipid profiles were analyzed on occasions before drug therapy was initiated and months after therapy commenced
12984,the tc hdl and ldl hdl ratios were computed for all sampling times and used to assess pretreatment and post treatment cvd risk
12985,fasting tc tg and ldl c were all significantly reduced by therapy
12986,the pretreatment hdl c of mg dl was lowered to mg dl
12987,as a result the tc hdl risk ratio was only marginally reduced from to whereas the ldl hdl risk ratio remained unchanged by treatment
12988,in this man with tetraplegia atorvastatin drug monotherapy rapidly lowered tc tg ldl c and hdl c however the tc hdl ratio considered the best predictor of cvd risk was unchanged
12989,to observe the effects of huanglian jiedu decoction hjd a compound traditional chinese herbal medicine on lipid metabolism and its related gene expressions in rats with hyperlipidemia
12990,fifty sd rats were randomly divided into normal control group untreated group lipitor atorvastatin group and low and high dose hjd groups
12991,except the normal control group rats in the other groups were fed with high fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia
12992,then the rats were administered with corresponding drugs for weeks
12993,after treatment the serum levels of total cholesterol tc triacylglycerol tag low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c were assayed
12994,the activities of lipoprotein lipase lpl and hepatic lipase hl in liver tissues were measured
12995,low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ppargamma mrna expressions in liver tissues were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
12996,compared with the normal control group the levels of serum tc tag and ldl c in the untreated group were increased and the level of serum hdl c was reduced
12997,the activities of lpl and hl and expressions of ldlr and ppargamma mrnas in the untreated group were lower than those in the normal control group
12998,after treatment high dose hjd significantly improved hyperlipemia by decreasing tc tag and ldl c and increasing hdl c the activities of lpl and hl and expression levels of ldlr and ppargamma mrnas in liver tissues were also markedly enhanced in the high dose hjd group as compared with those in the untreated group
12999,hjd can activate the activity of lipid metabolism enzyme and enhance the expressions of ldlr and ppargamma mrnas to modulate the lipid metabolic disorders in rats with hyperlipidemia
13000,type diabetes mellitus is associated with a to fold increased risk of coronary heart disease chd
13001,combined therapy with an antihyperglycaemic agent and an hmg coa reductase inhibitor statin is indicated for the treatment of diabetic patients at risk of chd
13002,patients with type diabetes are generally considered to be at equivalent cardiovascular disease risk to patients with established chd and should have low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels reduced to mg dl or by
13003,atorvastatin is the drug of choice for lowering ldl cholesterol levels
13004,metformin is the first therapeutic option in type diabetes patients who are overweight or obese because it may also prevent vascular complications and mortality
13005,hence a fixed dose combination fdc of atorvastatin mg and metformin mg extended release er was developed for patients with type diabetes with or without hyperlipidaemia
13006,this study set out to establish bioequivalence between treatment test atorvastatin metformin er mg mg fdc and treatment reference atorvastatin mg lipitor and metformin mg glucophage xr administered concurrently as individual tablets
13007,the study was a randomized open label two treatment two period two sequence single dose crossover bioequivalence study in male subjects of asian origin aged years
13008,the order of receiving the test and reference treatments for each subject during both the periods of the study was determined according to an sas generated randomization schedule
13009,the two treatments were separated by a washout period of days
13010,blood samples were collected pre dose and up to hours post dose in each period for determination of plasma atorvastatin metformin concentrations and calculation of the respective pharmacokinetic parameters
13011,anova was performed on the lognormal transformed pharmacokinetic parameters
13012,a confidence interval ci for the ratios of the test and reference product averages least squares means was calculated for atorvastatin and metformin to establish bioequivalence
13013,the cis for atorvastatin and metformin were within the bioequivalence acceptance criteria of
13014,the cis obtained for atorvastatin for maximum plasma concentration c max area under the plasma concentration time curve auc from time zero to time of last measurable concentration auc last and auc from time zero to infinity auc were and respectively
13015,the cis observed for metformin for c max auc last auc and auc from time zero to hours auc were and respectively
13016,the two treatments were well tolerated by the study subjects
13017,atorvastatin metformin er mg mg fdc has similar bioavailability to the co administration of separate atorvastatin mg and metformin mg tablets
13018,the fdc tablets show similar safety and tolerability profiles to their individual components
13019,therefore atorvastatin metformin er mg mg fdc tablets can be used safely in clinical settings to decrease the pill burden and increase patient compliance with therapy
13020,hmg coa reductase inhibitors statins have effects beyond lipid lowering including immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory properties
13021,statins are frequently combined with immunosuppressive agents in transplant recipients to modulate the hyperlipidemic side effects of the immunosuppressants
13022,however the role of statins in the immunosuppressive response that is achieved in individual patients remains to be assessed
13023,the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of atorvastatin given alone and in combined treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil
13024,two patient groups were studied renal transplant recipients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil therapy and hypercholesterolemic patients the control group
13025,fasting blood samples were taken from participants before and month after atorvastatin treatment was started to study a small battery of biomarkers that are able to reflect the range of the effects of immunosuppressive therapy and atorvastatin
13026,all patients in the study were enrolled at the hospital clinic of barcelona
13027,all patients enrolled in the study were candidates for treatment with atorvastatin because of high cholesterol levels
13028,one group consisted of stable renal transplant recipients with low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels above mg dl after months of therapeutic lifestyle changes according to the guidelines of the national kidney foundation kidney disease outcomes quality initiative
13029,the other group included hypercholesterolemic patients with ldl cholesterol levels above target values for the patients overall risk as derived from the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel iii criteria
13030,atorvastatin lipitor treatment was started at a fixed dose of mg daily
13031,the studied biomarkers were lymphocyte proliferation intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp synthesis in cd t cells intralymphocytary cytokine expression interleukin il interferon ifn soluble cytokine production il ifn il il and transforming growth factor and regulatory t t reg cells
13032,atorvastatin proved to be an immunomodulatory agent significantly decreasing lymphocyte proliferation by p increasing atp levels by p and showing a trend toward increasing t reg cells in hypercholesterolemic patients p
13033,in the renal transplant recipients atorvastatin therapy did not modify any of the biomarkers of immunosuppression that were studied
13034,atorvastatin showed immunoregulatory effects on t cells in hypercholesterolemic patients
13035,these effects were absent in renal transplant recipients suggesting that the beneficial effects of atorvastatin in this patient group do not relate to immunoregulation
13036,therefore statin treatment cannot be considered as a means to reduce the dose of immunosuppressive agents
13037,to systematically review published randomized controlled trials rct evaluating a new topical diclofenac solution pennsaid in patients with osteoarthritis oa of the knee
13038,rct were identified by searching electronic data sources as well as by contact with the manufacturer of pennsaid
13039,details of study demographics methodology quality and outcomes were analyzed
13040,a metaanalysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of pennsaid in oa of the knee was performed
13041,four rct were analyzed in this systematic review published reports and one published abstract
13042,mean trial duration was weeks
13043,generally these rct were of excellent quality
13044,the mean jadad quality score was out of many indicators of high quality in a rct were found in these rct including adequate descriptions of the methods used for randomization blinding and allocation concealment
13045,in comparison to a vehicle control placebo vcp the standardized mean differences smd for the womac pain stiffness and physical function subscales as well as for patient global assessment were all statistically significant in favor of pennsaid with smd ranging from to pennsaid was as safe as vcp with the only exception that it was more likely to result in minor skin dryness at the site of application relative risk
13046,in a week equivalence trial that used the womac subscales to compare treatment response pennsaid was as effective as oral diclofenac but was much better tolerated
13047,pennsaid is an effective topical nsaid in patients with oa of the knee
13048,apart from minor localized skin reactions pennsaid was as safe as vcp
13049,it is not known whether the favorable results of pennsaid can be extrapolated to other topical nsaid preparations
13050,pennsaid deserves further consideration when the existing treatment guidelines for oa of the knee are updated
13052,to compare the safety and efficacy of a topical diclofenac solution versus oral diclofenac in relieving the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis oa of the knee in a randomized double blind double dummy equivalence trial
13053,a total of men and women with radiological evidence of primary knee oa and mild to severe symptoms were randomly assigned to treatment with a topical diclofenac solution plus placebo oral capsules or placebo topical solution plus oral diclofenac mg capsules
13054,patients applied drops of study solution and took study capsule times daily for weeks
13055,efficacy variables were pain and physical function measured by the western ontario and mcmaster universities womac va oa index and patient global assessment pga
13056,equivalence in the per protocol group was based on previously defined ranges of clinically significant difference
13057,safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events vital signs and laboratory data
13058,the difference in mean ci change scores final minus baseline between treatments was mm to for pain total scale mm mm to for physical function total scale mm and mm to for pga total scale mm
13059,the ci for each efficacy variable fell within the predefined equivalence ranges pain mm physical function mm pga mm indicating that no clinically relevant difference was found between the treatment arms
13060,safety analyses of patients applying topical diclofenac solution revealed some minor skin irritation at the application site mostly skin dryness in patients but a significantly reduced incidence relative to oral diclofenac of total and severe gastrointestinal gi adverse events including dyspepsia abdominal pain diarrhea and nausea
13061,the number of patients developing abnormal liver function tests including clinically significant elevation hemoglobin and creatinine clearance was significantly higher in the oral diclofenac group
13062,application of this topical diclofenac solution to the knee of patients with oa produced relief of symptoms equivalent to oral diclofenac with minor local skin irritation but significantly reduced incidence of diclofenac related gi complaints and abnormal laboratory values
13063,this article reviews topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid formulations available in the united states including advantages and disadvantages therapeutic usefulness adverse effects and formulation considerations
13064,in the united states several topical nsaid products are approved to treat painful conditions including diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel endo pharmaceuticals diclofenac sodium topical solution w w in dimethyl sulfoxide pennsaid mallinckrodt inc and diclofenac epolamine flector patch alpharma pharmaceuticals llc a subsidiary of pfizer inc
13065,recent studies suggest topical diclofenac preparations are effective for osteoarthritis pain and suggest the efficacy of topical formulations is similar to that achieved with oral nsaid formulations
13066,all nsaid formulations contain the same boxed warnings regarding cardiovascular and renal toxicity however topical nsaids are proposed to have a more favorable safety profile than oral nsaids due to the low serum concentrations achieved with topical nsaid formulations
13067,topical nsaids have been shown to be beneficial from both a therapeutics and adverse effect perspective and are increasingly recommended in treatment guidelines
13068,osteoarthritis oa is the most common chronic degenerative disease which is characterised by the destruction of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone
13069,the current treatment of oa is based primarily on the use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and analgesics
13070,there are disadvantages to routinely using nsaids in oa
13071,topical nsaids represent a potentially important advance in this regard as they may be significantly safer than oral nsaids
13072,cutaneous diclofenac solution pennsaid was developed for the treatment of symptomatic oa of the knee and contains diclofenac sodium as an active ingredient and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso a penetration enhancer
13073,to review i dermal drug application ii the treatment of oa with systemic and topical nsaid therapies and iii the clinical efficiency of pennsaid on the topical treatment of oa of the knee
13074,a literature search was carried out on skin topical drug delivery treatment of oa and assessment of published clinical studies with pennsaid
13075,the clinical studies showed that applying the topical diclofenac solution pennsaid to a painful knee with primary oa could provide symptom relief equivalent to oral diclofenac with minimal systemic side effects however studies are needed that compare the effectiveness of pennsaid with different topical forms of diclofenac
13076,oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are commonly used to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis oa but can produce harmful systemic effects and end organ damage
13077,a topical nsaid formulation may provide symptom relief with fewer adverse effects
13078,a new topical diclofenac sodium solution containing the absorption enhancer dimethyl sulfoxide was evaluated for the relief of the symptoms of primary oa of the knee
13079,a total of patients met entry criteria including abnormal radiographic findings and flare of pain and were randomized to receive drops of topical diclofenac solution or a vehicle control solution times daily for weeks
13080,we evaluated primary outcome measures the western ontario mcmaster universities lk oa index womac pain and physical function subscales and a patient global assessment and other measures stiffness and pain on walking at baseline and after final application
13081,we assessed safety by evaluation of adverse events vital signs and irritation at the application site
13082,topical diclofenac solution was significantly more effective than the vehicle control solution for all outcome measures pain p physical function p patient global assessment p stiffness p and pain on walking p among patients receiving topical diclofenac self limiting minor skin irritation occurred in of patients including dryness in rash in and paresthesia pruritus and vesiculobullous rash in each
13083,there was no significant difference between groups in nsaid related gastrointestinal tract complaints or in dropouts due to study related adverse effects
13084,topical diclofenac is effective in the treatment of the symptoms of primary oa of the knee with only minor local irritation and no significant systemic adverse events
13085,the extent of metabolism of diclofenac sodium in excised viable human skin was investigated using combination hplc and radioactivity assay
13086,in an earlier diffusion experiment using an in vitro flow through diffusion system radiolabelled diclofenac sodium in either lotion pennsaid or aqueous solution was applied to viable human skin either as single dose or multiple dose times over days
13087,in this study the receptor fluid samples from the diffusion experiment were subjected to extraction and the aliquot was analysed using hplc to separate diclofenac and authentic metabolites
13088,based on the radioactivity of each hplc fraction the collection time of the fractions was compared with the retention time of diclofenac and metabolites in standard solutions
13089,the samples from a single or multiple dose application of lotion showed radioactivity in mainly one fraction whose retention time corresponded with diclofenac
13090,other hplc fractions showed none or only small amounts of radioactivity within the error range of the assay
13091,the same results were obtained with the pooled samples from the application of the lotion or of aqueous solution
13092,the results suggest that diclofenac sodium does not undergo metabolism in viable human epidermis during percutaneous absorption in vitro
13093,hence with topical application to human skin in vivo diclofenac will be delivered with minimal if any metabolism
13094,topical diclofenac solution pennsaid is a liquid formulation containing the nsaid diclofenac sodium w w
13095,the solution base contains w w dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to enhance the absorption of diclofenac through the skin
13096,topical diclofenac solution is applied directly to the knee for treatment of symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee
13097,in well designed to week trials in patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee topical diclofenac solution drops four times daily was significantly more effective than placebo or vehicle control carrier solution without diclofenac for improving western ontario and mcmaster universities womac osteoarthritis index pain and physical function and improving patient global assessment pga and or patient overall health assessment scores from baseline to the final assessments
13098,topical diclofenac solution drops three times daily was as effective as oral diclofenac mg day for improving womac pain and physical function and pga scores in a week double blind study in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee
13099,topical diclofenac solution was generally well tolerated
13100,the most common treatment emergent adverse event experienced by topical diclofenac solution recipients was dry skin at the application site
13101,gastrointestinal adverse events and abnormal laboratory parameters were less common with topical diclofenac solution than with oral diclofenac
13102,topical nsaids have been proven to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis oa in short term studies weeks
13103,to justify its chronic use efficacy of a topical nsaid over a longer term of study should be demonstrated
13104,the efficacy and safety of a topical diclofenac solution over a week treatment course in symptomatic primary oa of the knee was investigated
13105,men and women age years with radiologically confirmed primary oa of the knee and a flare of pain at baseline following discontinuation of prior therapy were enrolled into this double blind study
13106,participants applied either a topical diclofenac solution pennsaid or vehicle control solution carrier with no diclofenac drops times daily directly to the painful knee s without massage for weeks
13107,pre planned primary efficacy outcome measures included the core continuous variables pain relief and improved physical function measured by the western ontario and mcmaster universities womac lk oa index and improved patient global assessment pga
13108,secondary efficacy measure was reduced stiffness
13109,safety assessments included adverse events and vital signs
13110,the topical diclofenac group had a significantly greater mean change in score final minus baseline compared to the vehicle control group for pain vs p physical function vs p pga vs p and stiffness vs p
13111,the mean difference between treatment arms confidence interval ci was to to to and to respectively
13112,safety analyses showed that topical diclofenac caused skin irritation mostly minor local skin dryness in leading to discontinuation of treatment in participants
13113,this topical diclofenac solution demonstrated relief at weeks of the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis of the knee
13114,osteoarthritis oa is a chronic degenerative joint disease that is debilitating for many individuals
13115,while oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids remain a common and effective treatment approach to managing oa concerns over cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events can potentially limit their use
13116,various formulations of topical nsaids have been shown to provide effective localized treatment with minimal adverse events
13117,a patient perception study was conducted to evaluate patient preference between topical diclofenac sodium gel and that of diclofenac sodium topical solution with the penetration enhancer dimethyl sulfoxide dmso
13118,twenty four healthy volunteers were randomized and asked to administer one dose of the topical products
13119,surveys were provided and assessed immediately after application minutes after application and after the application had dried to gauge subjects overall experience with the topical preparation
13120,overall each drug s application was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported
13121,results of the patient preference survey demonstrated that topical diclofenac solution with dmso had a number of characteristics that were rated significantly better than for diclofenac sodium gel
13122,mean subjective responses to topical diclofenac solution with dmso were also more favorable for most items in the questionnaire and more subjects preferred or highly preferred topical diclofenac solution with dmso over diclofenac sodium gel
13123,the primary objective of this study was to determine the rate and extent of transdermal absorption for systemic delivery of diclofenac from pennsaid dimethaid research inc topical lotion into the systemic circulation after the lotion was applied to human volunteers in an open treatment non blinded non vehicle controlled study
13124,in addition the in vivo metabolism of this topical diclofenac lotion has also been studied
13125,human volunteers were dosed with topical c diclofenac sodium lotion on the knee for h sequential time blood and urine samples were taken to determine pharmacokinetics bioavailability and metabolism
13126,topical absorption was of applied dose
13127,peak plasma c occurred at h after dosing and peak urinary c excretion was at h the urinary c excretion pattern exhibits more elimination towards h and beyond as opposed to early urinary c excretion
13128,this suggests a continuous delivery of c diclofenac sodium from the lotion into and through skin which only ceased when the dosing site was washed
13129,skin surface residue at h was dose remainder assumed lost to clothing and bedding
13130,extraction of metabolites from urine amounted to in untreated urine suggesting substantial diclofenac metabolism to more water soluble metabolites probably conjugates which could not be extracted by the method employed
13131,two dimensional tlc analysis of untreated urine showed minimal or no diclofenac again emphasizing the extensive in vivo metabolism of this drug
13132,treatment of the same urine samples with the enzymes sulfatase and beta glucuronidase showed a substantial increase in the extractable material
13133,three spots were consistently present in each sample run namely diclofenac hydroxy diclofenac and an intermediate polar metabolite probably a hydroxylated metabolite
13134,therefore there was significant sulfation and glucuronidation of both diclofenac and numerous hydroxy metabolites of diclofenac but many of the metabolites conjugates remain unidentified
13135,conclusions there was a continuous delivery of diclofenac sodium from the lotion into and through the skin which ceased after the dosing site was washed
13136,the majority of the material excreted in the urine were conjugates of hydroxylated metabolites and not the parent chemical although further identification is required
13137,interest is increasing in the use of sequential or combined therapeutic modalities for spot or area treatment of actinic keratoses aks to achieve complete sustained remission
13138,for multiple lesions in a contained area topical treatment offers less discomfort better cosmesis and greater patient convenience than destructive ablative techniques
13139,twelve patients with multiple grade i and ii ak lesions of the scalp cases or the dorsum of the hand cases and most with a history of recurrence were treated with solaraze gel diclofenac sodium in hyaluronic acid twice daily for weeks followed by a week treatment free interval then actikerall cutaneous solution fluorouracil mg g and salicylic acid mg g once daily for up to weeks as required
13140,sequential treatment provided complete clinical and histological clearance in male patients
13141,two patients with numerous lesions had partial clearance significant improvement and the remaining few lesions were treated with erbium laser
13142,both female patients achieved complete clinical clearance with sequential treatment
13143,solaraze actikerall were well tolerated
13144,a case of contact dermatitis with solaraze resolved after discontinuation and the patient progressed to treatment with actikerall
13145,local application site reactions resolved upon treatment completion
13146,topical lesion directed sequential treatment with solaraze actikerall is a rational approach to treat patients with multiple aks
13147,sequential treatment produces excellent clearance rates which are accompanied by relevant improvement in patients quality of life
13148,solaraze gel shire deutschland gmbh co kg cologne germany containing diclofenac has been licensed in as a topical treatment for actinic keratoses
13149,it is commonly used in dermatological practice
13150,undesirable effects are believed to be rare but include pruritus paresthesia and application site reactions dry skin rash erythema contact dermatitis and vesicobullous eruptions
13151,recently a few cases of contact dermatitis due to three different allergens including diclofenac have been reported
13152,topical treatment with diclofenac in hyaluronic acid solaraze has been extensively documented for the treatment of actinic keratoses ak
13153,since sun protection is a vital part of ak management two phase iv studies were carried out to investigate the phototoxicity and photosensitisation potential of diclofenac in hyaluronic acid in combination with sunscreens
13154,patches of diclofenac in hyaluronic acid and control were applied under occlusion to the backs of healthy volunteers aged in the phototoxicity study n a single application followed by administration of the sunscreens and exposition with ultraviolet uv were done whereas in the photosensitisation study application was repeated twice weekly for three weeks then once after a two week rest phase
13155,the erythema reaction was recorded together with other local skin reactions
13156,in both analyses areas treated with diclofenac in hyaluronic acid in combination with sunscreens had the lowest incidence of erythema reactions indicating that it was well tolerated when used in conjunction with sunscreen products and with exposure to uv irradiation
13157,the results showed that no phototoxic or photosensitisation reactions occurred with diclofenac in hyaluronic acid either alone or in combination with sunscreens
13158,hyaluronic acid ha is a naturally occurring polyanionic polysaccharide that consists of n acetyl d glucosamine and beta glucoronic acid
13159,it is present in the intercellular matrix of most vertebrate connective tissues especially skin where it has a protective structure stabilizing and shock absorbing role
13160,the unique viscoelastic nature of ha along with its biocompatibility and non immunogenicity has led to its use in a number of clinical applications which include the supplementation of joint fluid in arthritis as a surgical aid in eye surgery and to facilitate the healing and regeneration of surgical wounds
13161,more recently ha has been investigated as a drug delivery agent for various routes of administration including ophthalmic nasal pulmonary parenteral and topical
13162,in fact regulatory approval in the usa canada and europe was granted recently for diclofenac in ha gel solaraze for the topical treatment of actinic keratoses which is the third most common skin complaint in the usa
13163,the gel is well tolerated safe and efficacious and provides an attractive cost effective alternative to cryoablation curettage or dermabrasion or treatment with fluorouracil
13164,the purpose of this review is to describe briefly the physical chemical and biological properties of ha together with some details of its medical and pharmaceutical uses with emphasis on this more recent topical application
13165,a clearance rate of all occurrences or for actinic keratoses ak lesions is an accepted efficacy endpoint for topical agents
13166,this efficacy endpoint has not been assessed for diclofenac sodium gel solaraze
13167,we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac sodium gel in the treatment of ak for a treatment period of days and a day follow up period
13168,this is a multicenter single arm open label study in patients diagnosed with five or more ak lesions contained in to blocks cm on the forehead central face or scalp
13169,patients were treated twice daily with a topical application of diclofenac sodium gel for a period of days with a follow up assessment at days post treatment
13170,the presence or absence of target lesions and new lesions was assessed at each visit a long with a global improvement index score
13171,of the patients who entered the study patients completed the study
13172,at day of treatment of patients had or ak lesion clearance based on the target lesion number score tlns
13173,improving to of patients demonstrating or ak lesion clearance at day follow up
13174,improvement was also demonstrated by ak lesion clearance based on the tlns clearance day of treatment day follow up
13175,similar improvements were shown in cumulative lesion number score clns which included new as well as targeted ak lesions within the designated treatment areas at day and day follow up
13176,investigators assessment based on investigator global improvement index igii confirmed the efficacy of diclofenac gel in the clearance of ak lesions
13177,a total of patients experienced at least adverse event considered to be related to diclofenac sodium gel during the study
13178,dry skin and rash at the application site were most common reported adverse events and most of these adverse events were mild or moderate in severity
13179,the topical application of diclofenac sodium gel provides a safe and effective approach for the treatment of ak
13180,recently solaraze gel bioglan herts uk a topical hyaluronan ha diclofenac formulation for the treatment of actinic keratosis has received regulatory approval in the us canada and europe for the treatment of actinic keratosis
13181,however a mechanism of action to explain the topical delivery properties of ha remains to be elucidated
13182,thus the aim of this study was to compare the effect of ha with other glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate cs heparin hp and pharmaceutically relevant polysaccharides sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and pectin on the dermal partitioning and percutaneous penetration of diclofenac and ibuprofen
13183,the studies demonstrated that ha significantly enhanced the partitioning of both diclofenac and ibuprofen into human skin when compared to an aqueous control pectin and carboxymethylcellulose p
13184,although the ha vehicle increased the partitioning of both drugs compared to the effects of the other glycosaminoglycans cs and hp this difference was not significant p
13185,however the results from the franz cell diffusion studies showed that ha w w significantly enhanced the amount of drug localising within the skin when compared to all of the other polysaccharides p
13186,the results suggest that the use of ha as a vehicle excipient offers potential advantages in the dermal delivery and localisation of drugs
13187,the cost of topical treatments for actinic keratosis ak has historically been evaluated in relation to the number of lesions requiring treatment or simply by the price of a single tube sachet of the drug used
13188,to demonstrate a new method of costing topical treatments in ak which takes into account the actual cancerization area treated
13189,in order to evaluate the actual cost of each treatment the official approval status of the drug was used to estimate the amount of cream needed per one cm
13190,areas which could be treated with a single tube sachet of metvix
13191,changing treatment costing strategy in the management of multiple aks towards costing per cancerization area instead of costing per lesion is a much more accurate representation of the real world cost for ak
13192,in addition to having anti inflammatory activities nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids also inhibit neoplastic cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis
13193,diclofenac is the anti neoplastic compound in diclofenac gel solaraze used for topical treatment of actinic keratosis ak
13194,main target of nsaids seems to be the inhibition of cyclo oxygenase cox which is overexpressed in several epithelial tumours and catalyses the synthesis of prostaglandins
13195,the precise mechanism of action of diclofenac in cutaneous cells is still unclear but induction of apoptosis is a key effect of anti neoplastic drugs including nsaids
13196,in this paper we give an overview of the anti tumoural activities of nsaids with emphasis on induction of apoptosis
13197,cyclo oxygenase mediated synthesis of prostaglandin e pge leads to activation of mitogen activated protein kinase mapk as well as phosphatidylinositol kinase pik akt pathways
13198,induction of the anti apoptotic bcl and mcl as well as activation of the caspase inhibitor cflip have been reported
13199,in addition altered lipid concentrations in the cytoplasmic membrane may modulate death receptor activities
13200,downregulation of both the intrinsic mitochondrial and the extrinsic pathways have been reported
13201,our data demonstrate induced apoptosis and activation of the caspase cascade in three of four cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma scc cell lines after treatment with diclofenac plus hyaluronic acid and diclofenac alone one cell line remained nonresponsive
13202,the effects were less pronounced in normal keratinocytes and cytotoxic effects were not seen
13203,detailed analysis of apoptosis pathways employed by diclofenac in these cells may help to improve therapeutic strategies and to overcome possible mechanisms that are involved in nonresponsiveness
13204,actinic keratoses aks are epidermal skin lesions that have the potential to develop into squamous cell carcinoma
13205,many of the treatment options available can cause discomfort pain or skin irritation
13206,topical diclofenac in hyaluronan gel solaraze bioglan pharma is a relatively new treatment that has been shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of aks
13207,disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis dsap is the most common of the of five clinical variants of porokeratosis
13208,these are disorders of keratinization and the distinctive pathological feature is the cornoid lamella at the margin
13209,dsap usually manifests in the third or fourth decades of life with a female preponderance and with multiple lesions over sun exposed areas
13210,a diverse range of treatments is employed though evidence of efficacy remains largely anecdotal
13211,we report a series of eight patients with dsap treated with diclofenac gel solaraze gel
13212,the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of laser microporation using p l e a s e technology on diclofenac delivery kinetics
13213,skin transport of diclofenac was studied from aqueous solution propylene glycol and marketed formulations across intact and laser porated porcine and human skins cumulative permeation and skin deposition were quantified by hplc
13214,after h cumulative diclofenac permeation across skins with and shallow pores m was and fold superior to that across untreated skin
13215,it was also found to be linearly dependent on laser fluence permeation g cm fluence j cm r
13216,after h permeation was and g cm at and j cm respectively
13217,however there was no statistically significant effect of laser fluence on skin deposition
13218,diclofenac delivery from marketed gel formulations was also significantly higher across laser porated skins e g
13219,for solaraze cumulative permeation after h across treated pores j cm and untreated skin was and g cm respectively
13220,diclofenac delivery from solaraze across laser porated porcine and human skins was also shown to be statistically equivalent
13221,the results demonstrated that laser microporation significantly increased diclofenac transport from both simple and semi solid formulations through porcine and human skin and that pore depth and pore number could modulate delivery kinetics
13222,a similar improvement in topical diclofenac delivery in vivo may increase the number of potential therapeutic applications
13223,progression from actinic keratosis ak and bowen s disease bd to invasive disease involves a complex cascade of events
13224,the preparation of diclofenac gel solaraze shire pharmaceuticals has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in ak
13225,the inhibition of the cox enzymes results in a decrease in downstream by products of arachidonic acid metabolism
13226,these metabolites have been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting epithelial tumour growth
13227,given its mechanism of action we hypothosize that diclofenac gel may have potential to halt the progression of actinic keratoses aks in the setting of field cancerisation and bd
13228,we report a series of five patients with bd all treated with diclofenac gel with clinical and histological clearance
13229,topical diclofenac in hyaluronic acid ha gel diclofenac ha gel solaraze is an nsaid approved for the treatment of actinic keratoses ak
13230,the efficacy of diclofenac ha gel g applied twice daily to each cm x cm treatment area in patients with ak has been evaluated in three randomized double blind ha gel vehicle controlled trials
13231,in each trial efficacy was assessed days after the end of treatment because an earlier study revealed that resolution of lesions was greater when measured after a week interval rather than at the end of treatment
13232,in two fully published multicenter trials there was no difference in baseline characteristics of the study groups
13233,in a further single center study not yet published patients randomized to diclofenac ha gel had a significantly higher mean number of target lesions at baseline compared with ha gel vehicle
13234,in the two published studies the efficacy of diclofenac ha gel increased with increased treatment duration
13235,when compared with ha gel vehicle recipients significant improvements in total lesion number scores tlns cumulative lesion number scores clns patient global improvement indices pgii and investigator global improvement indices igii were obtained in patients treated for and but not days with diclofenac ha gel
13236,fifty percent of patients treated for days with diclofenac ha gel vs in ha gel vehicle recipients and of those treated for days vs had tlns and clns of zero at the end of follow up
13237,in the third trial in which treatment was applied for days there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with tlns or clns of zero at the end of follow up
13238,however when controlling for the significant difference in mean baseline target lesion scores by calculating the mean change from baseline in lesion counts tlns and clns were significantly lower in recipients of diclofenac ha gel than ha gel vehicle at the end of follow up
13239,pruritus was the most frequently reported adverse event in all trials and the incidence was generally similar or lower in patients treated with diclofenac ha gel than ha gel vehicle
13240,in conclusion diclofenac ha gel produces significant reductions in the number of ak lesions and can produce complete clearance of lesions when applied twice daily for or days
13241,the product is well tolerated and did not produce serious adverse cosmetic effects in clinical trials
13242,thus diclofenac ha gel represents a useful addition to the array of pharmacologic treatments available for ak
13243,the purpose of this study was to determine if non specific cox inhibition could extend pore lifetime in hairless guinea pigs following microneedle treatment
13244,hairless guinea pigs were treated with microneedle arrays daily application of solaraze gel diclofenac sodium non specific cox inhibitor and hyaluronic acid transepidermal water loss was utilized to evaluate pore lifetime
13245,to examine the permeation of naltrexone additional guinea pigs were treated with microneedles daily solaraze gel followed by application of a transdermal naltrexone patch pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma naltrexone levels was performed
13246,histological analysis was employed to visualize morphological changes following microneedle and solaraze treatment
13247,animals treated with microneedles solaraze displayed extended pore lifetime determined by transepidermal water loss measurements for up to days
13248,enhanced naltrexone permeation was also observed for an extended amount of time in animals treated with microneedles solaraze
13249,no morphological changes resulting from microneedle treatment or cox inhibition were noted
13250,non specific cox inhibition is an effective means of extending pore lifetime following microneedle treatment in hairless guinea pigs
13251,this may have clinical implications for extending transdermal patch wear time and therefore increasing patient compliance with therapy
13252,the treatment of actinic keratoses aks provides an important opportunity to prevent the development of squamous cell carcinoma
13253,the recent discovery that cyclo oxygenase cox is a potential pharmacological target for skin tumours has prompted interest in using topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids as a treatment for aks
13254,topical diclofenac in hyaluronic acid gel solaraze is currently the only nsaid licensed for the treatment of aks
13255,in randomised double blind studies this therapy was effective in clearing aks with the efficacy increasing in proportion to the duration of treatment
13256,topical diclofenac in hyaluronic acid gel was well tolerated with the vast majority of adverse events rated as mild or moderate
13257,older treatments such as fluorouracil which promotes an inflammatory response are also effective in treating aks but are not acceptable to many patients because of severe irritation
13258,imiquimod is an alternative inflammatory treatment which although highly effective is expensive and produces severe erythema erosion and flaking in a large proportion of patients
13259,topical anti inflammatory agents such as diclofenac in hyaluronic acid gel can facilitate the early treatment of aks without the level of severe side effects observed with some of the other therapies
13260,diclofenac sodium gel solaraze gained us approval for the treatment of actinic keratosis ak more than years ago
13261,since the publication of the pivotal phase studies numerous clinical studies have assessed use of this therapy in a variety of body areas special populations and novel combinations
13262,to provide a comprehensive update on clinical data and research on the use of diclofenac sodium gel in ak
13263,review of the literature
13264,accumulating evidence from preclinical research supports that the proposed mechanism of diclofenac sodium gel may include cyclo oxgenase cox inhibition inhibition of angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis
13265,a literature review identified publications beyond the pivotal studies on the use of diclofenac sodium gel for ak
13266,a phase open label study reported that percent of patients achieved complete clearance of target lesions at the day post treatment assessment among patients who were evaluable at year post treatment sustained long term clearance of ak lesions was observed
13267,active comparator studies demonstrated comparable efficacy of diclofenac sodium gel with fluorouracil and imiquimod
13268,publications on the efficacy of diclofenac sodium gel for ak of the lip report complete clearance rates comparable to those reported for other body areas
13269,diclofenac sodium gel has also demonstrated efficacy for clearing ak lesions in immunosuppressed populations
13270,sequential use of diclofenac sodium gel with cryosurgery or photodynamic therapy has been investigated and may emerge as a useful approach for some patients
13271,diclofenac sodium gel has a unique proposed mechanism of action in ak that may involve cox inhibition inhibition of angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis
13272,in the past decade numerous clinical studies have demonstrated this topical therapy to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of ak
13273,this study is an evaluation of patients diagnosed with actinic keratosis ak lesions of the upper and lower lip both cutaneous and mucosal surfaces with at least one lesion on the vermilion mucosal lip
13274,patients were treated twice daily with a topical application of diclofenac sodium gel solaraze gel doak dermatologics for a period of days with a follow up assessment at days post treatment
13275,the presence or absence of target and new lesions was assessed and quantified at the initial baseline visit and at each follow up visit
13276,an investigator global improvement index score assessment and an evaluation of tolerability was also performed at each follow up visit
13277,the application of diclofenac sodium gel provides an effective approach for the treatment of ak of the lip
13278,the cure rate reported in this study for ak of the lip was similar to that of diclofenac sodium gel for ak on skin elsewhere on the body and has a low incidence of irritation and other adverse reactions as well as a high rate of patient satisfaction
13279,the unique safety and tolerability profile of diclofenac sodium gel would appear to lend itself well to treatment of the mucosal lip and vermilion particularly when treatment decisions involve cosmetic appearance during and subsequent to therapy
13280,the purpose of this study was to develop a new method using beagle dogs in order to evaluate the colonic absorption properties of oral extended release er solid dosage forms
13281,the established method is not only noninvasive and inexpensive but full sized er dosage forms are also directly administered to the colons of conscious dogs through the anus with an endoscope and modified bioptome
13282,in the method it was possible to administer the er dosage forms into the ascending colon of dogs within s min
13283,the colonic absorption of voltaren xr diclofenac sodium glucophage xr metformin pacif morphine hydrochloride herbesser r diltiazem hydrochloride and plendil felodipine which are currently on the market were investigated by this method
13284,the relative bioavailabilities of these er dosage forms to oral drug solution were and respectively
13285,some of these results reflected the human colonic absorption profiles reported in the literature
13286,this newly developed method could provide researchers with an alternative way to predict the human colon absorption performance of oral er delivery systems
13287,the influence of different cyclodextrin derivatives on the in vitro permeability of diclofenac sodium through pig cornea was investigated and compared to the commercial product voltaren ophtha
13288,hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin hp beta cd and two amorphous methylated cyclodextrins with different degrees of substitution were used
13289,in hemolysis studies on human erythrocytes the hemolytic activity of the different cyclodextrins and the drug was assessed
13290,it was shown that hp beta cd reveals the most favorable toxicological properties
13291,a decrease in the hemolytic activity of diclofenac was yielded by adding hp beta cd
13292,in the permeability experiments the dependency of the permeability coefficients and lag times on the type of cyclodextrin and ph of the solutions were examined
13293,a solution containing hp beta cd buffered in the ph range to is proposed as a useful eye drop formulation
13294,all cyclodextrin formulations showed advantages as compared to voltaren ophtha
13295,pharmacologic treatment of chronic pain is challenging
13296,oral therapy may require multiple medications each has side effects dose limitations and limited efficacy
13297,compounded topical formulations have evolved as potential treatment options
13298,the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of compounded topical creams cream i and cream ii in patients with chronic extremity joint musculoskeletal neuropathic or other chronic topical pain conditions and compare their efficacy with voltaren gel
13299,the primary efficacy outcome was the change in visual numeric pain intensity score from pretreatment to posttreatment
13300,the cream i contained flurbiprofen tramadol clonidine cyclobenzaprine and bupivacaine
13301,the cream ii contained flurbiprofen baclofen clonidine gabapentin and lidocaine
13302,the voltaren gel contained diclofenac sodium
13303,a total of patients were evaluated males and females
13304,during their medical treatment patients received cream i patients received cream ii and patients received voltaren gel
13305,after treatment the pain intensity score decreased by with cream i from to p by with cream ii from to p and by with voltaren gel from to p
13306,cream i and cream ii did not differ significantly in efficacy and both were significantly more effective than voltaren gel p
13307,it is concluded that voltaren gel had less efficacy than the compounded creams which were effective and provided pain relief in the majority of the patients studied
13308,we report a rare case of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug induced pneumonitis in a year old man taking diclofenac for wound pain after pulmonary resection
13309,the pneumonitis and pleural effusion were predominant on the operative side and resolved rapidly after the diclofenac was discontinued
13310,the diagnosis of drug induced pneumonitis was based on a lymphocyte stimulation test that was positive for diclofenac sodium and negative for other drugs
13311,this case report demonstrated that surgeons should be aware of the possibility of pneumonitis induced by a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug
13312,the influence of the arachidonic acid metabolism inhibitors indomethacin and voltaren an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity theophylline and the protease inhibitor epsilonaminocaproic acid eaca on n ethyl n nitrosourea enu induced transplacental carcinogenesis was studied in rats
13313,enu was given to pregnant rats as a single i v
13314,exposure at a dose of mg kg body weight on the st day after conception
13315,indomethacin and voltaren p p m
13316,in drinking water theophylline in diet and eaca p p m
13317,in drinking water were given to the offspring throughout their post natal life until all survivors were killed at months
13318,in the enu only control groups of the offspring developed tumors of brain spinal cord peripheral nervous system or kidneys with a total average number of tumors per rat
13319,the most marked inhibitory effect was exerted by theophylline which significantly decreased the incidence and multiplicity of total tumors and at all main sites selectively brain spinal cord peripheral nerves and kidneys
13320,it also prolonged average survival time of the offspring
13321,indomethacin and voltaren significantly decreased total tumor incidence and multiplicity and brain tumor incidence and multiplicity
13322,indomethacin also decreased kidney tumor multiplicity and voltaren diminished spinal cord tumor multiplicity
13323,eaca decreased multiplicities of total brain peripheral nerve and kidney tumors and diminished the incidence of brain tumors
13324,these chemopreventive agents decreased tumor incidences and tumor multiplicities times compared with the enu only controls
13325,limited research has evaluated the consumer usability of written information available with similar over the counter otc products in different countries
13326,this study evaluated the usability of labels and leaflets for australian and uk otc diclofenac products and explored consumer perspectives on their design content usability and potential improvements
13327,australian and uk otc diclofenac products were selected for user testing
13328,demographically matched groups of australian and uk consumers were recruited to user test each label and leaflet set to determine whether salient clinical messages could be found and understood
13329,consumer perspectives on the tested label and leaflet were explored using semi structured interviews as part of user testing
13330,forty consumers user tested the voltaren rapid australia and voltarol pain eze extra strength mg tablets uk information participants per brand per country
13331,dosage maximum daily dose and contraindications information was found and understood by most per group except the voltaren dosage which was misunderstood by
13332,however could not locate the maximum duration of continuous use in the voltaren leaflet
13333,participants had difficulty determining that another nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug could not be used with diclofenac and understood this in the voltaren and voltarol groups respectively
13334,suggested label and leaflet improvements included increased font size bolding highlighting and color
13335,when evaluated in both countries not all key clinical information was effectively communicated by information accompanying australian and uk diclofenac products
13336,improvements in how information is communicated are needed
13337,this article reviews topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid formulations available in the united states including advantages and disadvantages therapeutic usefulness adverse effects and formulation considerations
13338,in the united states several topical nsaid products are approved to treat painful conditions including diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel endo pharmaceuticals diclofenac sodium topical solution w w in dimethyl sulfoxide pennsaid mallinckrodt inc and diclofenac epolamine flector patch alpharma pharmaceuticals llc a subsidiary of pfizer inc
13339,recent studies suggest topical diclofenac preparations are effective for osteoarthritis pain and suggest the efficacy of topical formulations is similar to that achieved with oral nsaid formulations
13340,all nsaid formulations contain the same boxed warnings regarding cardiovascular and renal toxicity however topical nsaids are proposed to have a more favorable safety profile than oral nsaids due to the low serum concentrations achieved with topical nsaid formulations
13341,topical nsaids have been shown to be beneficial from both a therapeutics and adverse effect perspective and are increasingly recommended in treatment guidelines
13342,in experiments on male rats there was studied the influence of an inductor of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes phenobarbital an inhibitor of microsomal monooxygenases cobalt chloride and also coenzyme forms of vitamins b and b thiamine diphosphate and flavin mononucleotide on the anti inflammatory effect of voltaren evaluated according to inhibition of an increase of the limb edema a decrease of pain sensitivity the blood level of fucose and the liver level of malondialdehyde in rats with adjuvant arthritis
13343,phenobarbital weakens the anti inflammatory action of voltaren but at the same time cobalt chloride and thiamine diphosphate potentiate the therapeutic effect of voltaren
13344,flavin mononucleotide fails to modify the effect of voltaren but decreases however its toxicity
13345,clinical and laboratory examinations were conducted in order to assess the long term tolerability of voltaren a new anti inflammatory and analgesic agent
13346,pre treatment repeated on treatment and after treatment investigations of haemoglobin erythrocyte count total and differential leucocyte count platelet count sgot sgpt alkaline phosphatase total serum proteins and urinary protein and sugar were conducted in patients
13347,the period of treatment with voltaren was to days
13348,in all these tests there were no unwanted effects attributable to long term treatment with voltaren
13349,our study would indicate that voltaren is a safe drug which has no effect on the organs of haemopoiesis nor on hepatic or renal function even in long term therapy
13350,therefore voltaren can be used as an anti inflammatory and analgesic agent not only in short term therapy but also in the long term treatment of chronic diseases
13351,in experiments on rats it was shown that voltaren had a moderate degree and d glucosamine a pronounced degree of antiproliferative and antialterative effects
13352,on these models indomethacin and piroxicam also exerted a marked antiproliferative action and the ability to suppress tissue regeneration in alterative inflammation
13353,the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by diclofenac was studied with regard to effects on connective tissue contraction and on the chemotaxis of fibroblasts stimulated by platelet derived growth factor type bb pdgf bb
13354,collagen lattices populated with human fibroblasts responded to diclofenac with significantly increased contraction the peak effect occurred at a dose of micrograms ml
13355,using a two chamber system pdgf bb significantly increased the chemotactic activity of fibroblasts and addition of diclofenac further increased this activity
13356,higher doses of diclofenac resulted in cell death which was also reflected in lessened contraction of lattices with micrograms ml diclofenac half of the cells were dead
13357,the study showed that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by diclofenac increases the contraction of collagen lattices populated with human fibroblasts and increases the chemotactic activity of fibroblasts stimulated with pdgf bb
13358,although diclofenac sodium voltaren is one of the most frequently prescribed non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids worldwide for the treatment of inflammation and pain data on the ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues due to its chronic exposure are limited
13359,therefore the present study was designed to identify the ultrastructural renal alterations induced by diclofenac sodium
13360,the experiment was conducted at the animal house of the department of zoology college of science king saud university riyadh kingdom of saudi arabia during the period from april to june a total of male rabbits were exposed to intraperitoneal injection with a daily dose of diclofenac sodium mg kg body weight for days to investigate the resultant ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues
13361,in comparison with the respective control rabbits chronic exposure to therapeutic doses of diclofenac sodium produced significant ultrastructural renal alterations which involved swelling and cristolysis of the mitochondria marked dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum detachment of ribosomes increased lysosomal structures nuclear chromatin condensation in the tubular cells thickening of the glomerular basement membranes distention of glomerular capillaries which showed lodgment of neutrophils mesangial and endothelial cell proliferation in the glomeruli swelling and fusion of the glomerular podocytes foot processes with focal obliteration of the filtration slits
13362,the obtained results indicate that chronic exposure to diclofenac sodium produces significant ultrastructural alterations in renal tissues
13363,the efficacy of diclofenac suppositories was estimated in a two centre double blind placebo controlled study comprising patients in the diclofenac group and in the placebo group
13364,the series from the two centres and patients in the two treatment groups were comparable
13365,immediately postoperatively the patients received mg diclofenac followed by mg in the evening and mg in the morning after the operation or placebo suppositories
13366,the efficacy was assessed both by the patients and by the staff by marking on a visual analogue scale
13367,statistical analyses showed that diclofenac has a significant p less than effect on the pain associated with swallowing and on the general condition of the patients
13368,the therapeutic gain was calculated to
13369,as a consequence of this study treatment with diclofenac has been introduced in both ent departments
13370,platelets incubated with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors i e
13371,aspirin asa and diclofenac sodium voltaren show a decreased capability to aggregate
13372,while asa induces the complete loss of platelet pseudopodia voltaren causes the appearance of long needle shaped pseudopodia a finding which may suggest a rather increased tendency to aggregate
13373,platelets labeled with ferritin hydrazide and examined with a transmission electron microscope and by x ray analysis show a greater deposition of ferritin hydrazide after incubation with voltaren in comparison to those incubated with asa and to the controls
13374,this finding suggests an increased negative charge of the stretched platelet membrane after incubation with voltaren with a subsequent increase in the repulsive forces between platelets
13375,bleomycin is an anti neoplastic compound which produces a time and dose dependent pulmonary fibrosis
13376,the mechanisms which cause this fibrosis are not known
13377,however the ability of bleomycin to modulate prostaglandin synthesis degradation and circulating levels appears to be central to the fibrosis
13378,previous studies which have attempt to modulate bleomycin induced fibrosis by prevention of prostaglandin synthesis have conflicting results
13379,therefore the present study was designed to determine the effects of diclofenac acid a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory compound on the development of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis
13380,diclofenac acid pretreatment and daily injections prevented lung collagen accumulation after intratracheal bleomycin
13381,in addition diclofenac acid treatment resulted in significantly lower lung collagen level after intratracheal bleomycin at and days when compared with bleomycin alone
13382,these data indicate that diclofenac acid treatment inhibits bleomycin induced lung fibrosis possible through the prevention of prostaglandins synthesis
13383,the in vitro effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren on the ultrastructure of healthy donors platelets was examined and compared with those induced by aspirin asa
13384,in distinction to asa which causes loss of platelet pseudopodia voltaren induced an increase and marked elongation of these pseudopodia
13385,the implication of this finding in the explanation of the decreased platelet aggregation caused by the drug is discussed
13386,voltaren increased the phagocytotic activity of the individual platelet although the overall ability of the cells to phagocytize latex particles was not markedly increased
13387,platelets incubated with voltaren showed a decrease in their total protein synthesizing capacity
13388,voltaren did not exert any effect on the internal ultrastructure platelet factor and calcium content of the incubated platelets
13389,to reasons not yet completely understood the pharmaceutical trademark voltaren or voltarol refers to the italian scientist alessandro volta who played an important role in the history of electricity
13390,it is shown that electrotherapy has been used for the treatment of pain gout and rheumatic disorders from ancient times to the present day
13391,this therapeutic attempt was also discussed in scientific literature in the late s the time voltaren was under development
13392,therefore it is suggested that the electrotherapy of pain in history is a background for chosing this trademark
13393,in this study we apply a battery of molecular similarity techniques to known inhibitors of kynurenine monooxygenase kmo querying each against a repository of approved experimental nutraceutical and illicit drugs
13394,four compounds are assayed against kmo
13395,subsequently diclofenac also known by the trade names voltaren voltarol aclonac and cataflam has been confirmed as a human kmo protein binder and inhibitor in cell lysate with low micromolar
13396,to compare the efficacy tolerability and local tolerance of diclofenac sodium containing hydroxypropylgamma cyclodextrin preserved with benzalkonium chloride voltaren ophtha cd with that of diclofenac sodium preserved with thiomersal voltaren ophtha in the treatment of inflammation after cataract intraocular lens surgery
13397,randomised double masked parallel group study in six centres in germany
13398,patients scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
13399,study medications were instilled four times in the minutes before surgery and four times daily from the first postoperative day
13400,the key efficacy variable was the reduction in anterior chamber flare photons millisecond from day to day to patients underwent comprehensive ocular examinations including laser flaremetry kowa preoperatively and postoperatively at days to and to
13401,patients voltaren ophtha cd voltaren ophtha completed the day to visit without any protocol violations
13402,reduction in the degree of intraocular inflammation with voltaren ophtha cd was equivalent to that achieved with voltaren ophtha at the day to confidence interval ci to and day to ci to visits
13403,although there was no significant p difference between the two study groups in patients global assessment of local tolerance at day to ocular discomfort was significantly p less with voltaren ophtha cd compared with voltaren ophtha
13404,voltaren ophtha cd was as effective and well tolerated but had less ocular discomfort compared with voltaren ophtha in the treatment of ocular inflammation after phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation
13405,this new formulation of diclofenac sodium may be used as an alternative to the existing formulations of ophthalmic diclofenac sodium
13406,a double blind between patient comparative trial of diclofenac voltaren and naproxen was carried out in patients suffering from osteo arthrosis of the hip or the knee
13407,the drugs were given twice daily morning and evening during a period of two weeks
13408,the daily dose was mg for voltaren and mg for naproxen
13409,the results indicate that voltaren brought relief of pain and stiffness in a greater number of patients than did naproxen
13410,the same finding was made regarding the influence on the range of joint movements the difference reaching statistical significance
13411,voltaren appeared also to be better tolerated since the number of patients reporting side effects was smaller and the complaints of less severity
13412,multiple response optimization is an efficient technique to develop sustained release formulation while decreasing the number of experiments based on trial and error approach
13413,diclofenac matrix tablets were optimized to achieve a release profile conforming to usp monograph matching voltaren
13414,tablets were prepared by wet granulation using mixture of equivalent quantities of eudragit rl rs at overall polymer concentration of w w and compressed at kn
13415,drug release from the optimized formulation e w w kn was similar to voltaren conformed to usp monograph and found to be stable
13416,substituting lactose with mannitol reversing the ratio between lactose and microcrystalline cellulose or increasing drug load showed no significant difference in drug release
13417,using dextromethorphan hydrobromide as a model soluble drug showed burst release due to higher solubility and formation of micro cavities
13418,a numerical optimization technique was employed to develop a stable consistent promising formulation for sustained delivery of diclofenac
13419,diclofenac topical formulations are often preferred for drug administration to patients who experience serious git problems
13420,absorption of the drug through the skin however can be challenging due to the natural protective feature of the stratum corneum sc
13421,in this article fluid gels prepared from gellan gum were explored as a topical drug delivery vehicle
13422,rheological analysis of the formulations showed that it was possible to produce a topical gel with a viscosity and the mechanical strength similar to that of the commercially available voltaren
13423,this report describes dyspnea cough erythema multiforme and a diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrate associated with eosinophilic alveolitis in a year old man taking diclofenac sodium voltaren
13424,onset of these pulmonary abnormalities after beginning diclofenac therapy implicates this drug which to our knowledge has not been described previously to cause eosinophilic pneumonitis
13425,the current report expands the spectrum of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug induced eosinophilic pneumonitis and reviews available experience with other implicated non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
13426,with respect to diclofenac sodium containing tape preparations of nonsteroidal antiphlogistic drug we compared the pharmaceutical properties ph elongatedness water vapor permeability adhesive force and peeling force of medicinal drugs brand name and generic drugs to obtain evidence for product selection in line with the needs of the patient
13427,the elongatedness of the generic drugs teikoku yutoku and nippon zoki were significantly higher than the brand name drug voltaren
13428,the current state of cataract surgery for the millennium may be stated as minimally invasive techniques
13429,this review presents recent articles on the perioperative use of antibiotics primarily fluoroquinolones nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs voltaren and ketorolac and new corticosteroids rimexolone and loteprednol etabonate
13430,preoperative topical application of ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin results in a satisfactory minimal inhibitory concentration for most pathogens
13431,however one cannot determine the actual effect of intraoperative antibiotics on acute postoperative endophthalmitis because of its low overall incidence
13432,nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs especially voltaren may offer equivalent antiinflammatory efficacy for both postoperative inflammation and cystoid macular edema without the typically corticosteroid associated adverse events
13433,rimexolone and loteprednol etabonate two new corticosteroids may offer good antiinflammatory efficacy with greatly reduced risk for elevation of intraocular pressure
13434,to explore stiletto needle and needle knife for influence of double sufficient weight in treating knee osteoarthritis patients
13435,one hundred and thirteen early and medium term knee osteoarthritis patients were randomly divided into three groups including stiletto needle group cases needle knife group cases and voltaren group cases
13436,in stiletto needle group there were males and females with an average of years old treated by stiletto needle once a week and weeks were a course there were males and females in needle knife group with an average of years old treated by acupotome once a week and weeks were a course there were males and females in voltaren group with an average age of years old treated by votalin emulsion smearing to cm on painful area of knee joint three times a day for weeks patients in normal group including males and females with a mean age of years old treated with nothing
13437,gravitational four lattice used to measure bipedal back and forth load before and after treatment in further observe weight bearing situation among three groups d value which was the distance from center of gravity to original point was measured as a obvervational index joa score was used to evaluate clinical effect
13438,five patients were fall out including patients in stiletto needle group patients in needle knife group and patient in voltaren group
13439,other patients were followed up from to d with an average of d and without untoward effect
13440,there was significant difference in d value between treatment group and control group at month after treatment
13441,stiletto needle needle knife and voltaren for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis at early and middle stage center of gravity is closer to original point and weight bearing is improved
13442,it is a easy method of four lattice to measure change of weight bearing in koa patients after treatment
13443,in this article the advantages and the faults of diclofenac are described with short review of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and results of the recent clinical trials
13444,the advantages of voltaren are efficacy in all nsaid indications good tolerability favourable cox cox ratio the wide range of drug forms long treatment experience and extremely acceptable cost benefit ratio
13445,precaution in patients with risk is recommended
13446,a total of patients with moderate to severe pain due to localized rheumatic or traumatic conditions participated in a double blind randomized trial
13447,patients were randomly allocated to receive ultrasonic sessions three times weekly for weeks using either diclofenac in a gel base voltaren emulgel or regular gel as a coupling medium
13448,a statistically significant p less than improvement was achieved in both treatment groups in most of the evaluation criteria by the end of the first week
13449,treatment was prematurely discontinued due to complete cure in of patients using voltaren emulgel compared with only of those using regular gel p less than
13450,physician s assessment of complete relief of pain was also statistically significant p less than in favour of voltaren emulgel throughout the trial period and the physician s overall assessment of therapeutic efficacy revealed that a satisfactory result was achieved in of voltaren emulgel treated patients compared with of patients receiving regular gel p less than
13451,tolerability was good or excellent in over of patients in both treatment groups
13452,the results of the study strongly suggest that the use of voltaren emulgel as a coupling medium during ultrasonic therapy is a preferable effective alternative to the currently used regular gel
13453,diclophenac sodium voltaren has been tested against indomethacin and placebo in a four week double blind between patient trial in patients with rheumatoid arhritis
13454,the ameliorating effect of voltaren on the usual clinical parameters was comparable to that of indomethacin while no significant changes were observed in the placebo group
13455,side effects during treatment with voltaren and indomethacin appeared mainly form the gastrointestinal tract and from cns
13456,while side effects from the gastrointestinal tract were similar in the two groups side effects from the cns appeared significantly less frequent during treatment with voltaren than during treatment with indomethacin
13457,no skin reactions diarrhoea or gastrointestinal bleeding were observed in either group
13458,long term studies are needed to establish the place of voltaren in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
13459,due to the well know surfactant like properties of diclofenac sodium ds vesicular systems consisting exclusively of ds named diclosomes were designed with the aim to minimize or avoid the use of other excipients and to improve the formulation biocompatibility
13460,diclosomes were designed and characterized in terms of dimensions polydispersity index potential drug retained stability as a function of storage time and ex vivo percutaneous permeation profiles
13461,additionally diclosomes were incorporated into gel dosage forms and their performance in terms of permeation enhancement were evaluated
13462,ds was found to form nanosized vesicular systems both alone and in presence of cholesterol
13463,increasing hydrophobicity due to the presence of cholesterol resulted in smaller vesicles always spherical and homogeneous in shape
13464,permeation of ds from free solution was found to be lower respect to ones obtained for all diclosomal formulations allowing these aggregates to be considered as percutaneous permeation enhancers
13465,ds permeated from diclosomal gels was higher than that obtained with traditional niosomal gel ds plain gel and commercial specialty voltaren emulgel
13466,voltaren vehicle gel is the carrier substance of the topical voltaren products
13467,this vehicle gel is especially formulated to be easily applied on the skin while providing some sensory benefits
13468,the present study aims to substantiate the widely perceived hydrating and cooling effect of voltaren vehicle gel
13469,volar forearm skin hydration and transepidermal water loss tewl were measured and user satisfaction was evaluated by questionnaires after application in healthy female volunteers
13470,the cooling effect was investigated for min with thermal imaging on forearm sites of six healthy subjects
13471,voltaren vehicle gel application increased skin hydration by p when compared with the untreated site h after the final treatment after weeks
13472,tewl decreased on both treated g m h and untreated g m h forearm sites after weeks h after last treatment demonstrating a relative increase of in water loss
13473,voltaren vehicle gel application resulted in a rapid reduction of skin surface temperature by c after only min with an average maximum reduction of c after min
13474,the cooling effect was experienced by subjects while felt that their skin became softer
13475,no adverse events including skin irritation were reported during the study and by the participants
13476,this study showed a statistically significant increase in skin hydration as well as a rapid cooling effect lasting approximately min after application of voltaren vehicle gel
13477,the small relative increase in water loss may be attributed to an additional skin surface water loss secondary to the increased water content brought into the skin by the voltaren vehicle gel
13478,the use did not induce any skin irritation and was found acceptable to use by the majority of participants
13479,the antihypoxic effects of indomethacin voltaren and ibuprofen were studied experimentally by the parameters of acid base equilibrium of the blood and the ratio of lactic and pyruvic acids in the blood during chronic hemic and respiratory hypoxia
13480,the results of the studies suggested that indomethacin voltaren and to a lesser extent ibuprofen in the tested doses ld exerted the antihypoxic action that consisted in the improvement of oxygen supply to tissues under conditions of its deficiency the decrease of incompletely oxidized products of metabolism the enhancement of hemoglobin synthesis and the ability of voltaren to influence the increase of the number of erythrocytes in the peripheral blood
13481,we studied the capacity of ikk inhibitor p fluorophenyl ureido thiophene carboxamide and non steroidal anti inflammatory drug voltaren to reduce the severity of local inflammation in th and th type immune response
13482,the test substances inhibitor in concentrations from to m and m voltaren were shown to reduce edema caused by sheep erythrocytes th type immune response and local immediate type hypersensitivity response th type immune response
13483,the anti inflammatory effects of ikk inhibitor in th type immune response were similar to those of voltaren
13484,in this study in vitro characterization bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of different sustained release diclofenac sodium dosage forms were compared voltaren mg tablets manufactured by ciba geigy and inflaban mg enteric coated tablets manufactured by the arab pharmaceutical manufacturing company
13485,the in vitro results demonstrated a faster rate of dissolution for inflaban as compared to voltaren but both products exhibited a sustained release pattern
13486,the bioavailability study was conducted on healthy male subjects who received a single oral dose mg of each product according to a randomized way crossover design
13487,blood samples were obtained over a hour period and drug concentrations were determined by an hplc method
13488,concentration time profiles revealed a sustained release pattern for both products
13489,the tlag for voltaren was h significantly shorter than for inflaban h indicating a faster rate of absorption from the upper gastrointestinal tract
13490,the cmax obtained with voltaren was significantly higher than that obtained with inflaban and respectively
13491,with respect to tmax and auc h parameters both products were not found to be statistically different
13492,tmax for voltaren and inflaban was and h respectively whereas auc h values for both products were and ng x h ml respectively
13493,it is believed that the observed differences between voltaren and inflaban are mainly due to the fact that inflaban is designed as an enteric coated tablet form with a core tablet having different sustained release behavior
13494,in addition the effect of food on the bioavailability of inflaban was evaluated in randomly selected male volunteers
13495,our results revealed that following light and heavy meals the auc and cmax were minimally affected by food whereas a significant increase in tmax and tlag as compared to fasting conditions was observed
13496,it has been demonstrated in rat experiments that the beta adrenoblockers propranolol and pindolol differ in the influence on the therapeutic and toxic effects of voltaren and acetylsalicylic acid
13497,propranolol has an analgetic action of its own reducing the analgetic and antiinflammatory effects of voltaren and acetylsalicylic acid
13498,it potentiates the antipyretic effect of voltaren and ulcerogenic action of both nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
13499,pindolol exerts both analgetic and antiinflammatory action and does not affect the antipyretic effect of voltaren and ulcerogenic action of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
13500,the difference in the action of the beta adrenoblockers under study is likely to be linked with the characteristics of their pharmacological action spectrum
13501,drug sterilization with ionizing radiation is a well established technology which is constantly extending to several products due to its numerous advantages since it allows the heat free sterilization of heat sensitive pharmaceutical preparations
13502,in a previous study the possibility to identify irradiated solid state drugs by means of osl and tl was examined with very promising findings
13503,in the same respect the present work aims for the first time to the authors best knowledge to explore whether tl can be employed as a method for post sterilization dosimetry on commercial liquid state drugs by studying the properties of their glass containers
13504,two different types of glass containers bottle and ampoule of two widely used liquid drugs i e hexalen and voltaren are used for this purpose
13505,both glass containers exhibit a linear tl dose response for doses up to kgy with a stable behavior through time while no significant sensitization of the main peaks is observed
13506,thus preliminary findings are very promising towards the post sterilization dosimetry of liquid drugs and the use of the containers of commercial liquid drugs for normal and or accidental dosimetry
13507,evaluate systemic exposure with repeated topical application of a fixed combination topical gel product containing diclofenac sodium and menthol in either of formulation packages relative to oral administration
13508,in this phase single center way crossover study healthy volunteers aged years underwent consecutive day treatment regimens in a randomly assigned sequence with each of treatment groups g of topical diclofenac menthol gel administered via an aluminum tube or roll on device applied times daily g of topical diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel applied times daily and oral diclofenac sodium tablets mg times daily
13509,treatment regimens were separated by day washout periods
13510,a total of subjects enrolled and completed the study
13511,relative to oral administration area under the concentration time curve from to hours auc sub sub with topical administration of diclofenac menthol gel from a tube or roll on device was ci and ci respectively
13512,the diclofenac menthol combination delivered significantly higher exposures of diclofenac compared with voltaren gel
13513,a higher number of adverse events aes occurred with the topical diclofenac menthol combination vs voltaren gel or oral diclofenac most were local skin reactions
13514,no difference in systemic aes was observed among the groups
13515,as expected systemic exposure was significantly lower with the topical diclofenac menthol treatment regimens compared with oral diclofenac
13516,local skin aes were increased with the topical combination product but the risk of systemic aes was low
13518,two sustained release formulations microspheres and voltaren sr were evaluated for their drug release characteristics in dissolution in vitro study and after oral administration to beagle dogs in vivo study by hplc
13519,the dissolution study was carried out according to the paddle method and the pharmacokinetic study was conducted using hplc analysis in a crossover design in six female beagle dogs after oral administration of mg diclofenac sodium dfs
13520,the dissolution profiles showed release for voltaren sr and around for the microspheres
13521,oral administration of dfs resulted in auc and cmax values of microg h ml and microg ml for microspheres and microg h ml and microg ml for voltaren respectively
13522,the tmax was h for both formulations
13523,a significant difference in auc and cmax was observed for dfs absorption from microspheres and voltaren
13524,the results from the dissolution assay demonstrated the faster release of diclofenac sodium from microspheres
13525,the bioavailability of dfs in microspheres was about that of voltaren for the parameters auc and cmax and they are therefore not bioequivalent to voltaren in relation to the extent of absorption
13526,however the rate of drug absorption tmax was similar for the two formulations
13527,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids have shown efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis oa pain but are also associated with a dose dependent risk of gastrointestinal cardiovascular hematologic hepatic and renal adverse events aes
13528,topical nsaids were developed to provide analgesia similar to their oral counterparts with less systemic exposure and fewer serious aes
13529,topical nsaids have long been available in europe for the management of oa and guidelines of the european league against rheumatism and the osteoarthritis research society international specify that topical nsaids are preferred over oral nsaids for patients with knee or hand oa of mild to moderate severity few affected joints and or a history of sensitivity to oral nsaids
13530,in contrast the guidelines of the american pain society and american college of rheumatology have in the past recommended topical methyl salicylate and topical capsaicin but not topical nsaids
13531,this reflects the fact that the american guidelines were written several years before the first topical nsaid was approved for use in the united states
13532,neither salicylates nor capsaicin have shown significant efficacy in the treatment of oa
13533,in october diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel became the first topical nsaid for oa therapy approved in the united states following a long history of use internationally
13534,topical diclofenac sodium gel delivers effective diclofenac concentrations in the affected joint with limited systemic exposure
13535,clinical trial data suggest that diclofenac sodium gel provides clinically meaningful analgesia in oa patients with a low incidence of systemic aes
13536,this review discusses the pharmacology clinical efficacy and safety profiles of diclofenac sodium gel salicylates and capsaicin for the management of hand and knee oa
13537,the purpose of this study was examined the feasibility of using phytantriol based cubic and hexagonal liquid crystal preparation for the percutaneous administration of trans cinnamaldehyde tca
13538,tca loaded lyotropic liquid crystal formulations were prepared and characterized their skin permeability in vitro and in vivo was evaluated
13539,preliminary pharmacodynamics were also investigated in adjuvant arthritics aa rats
13540,the formulations were identified respectively as cubic and hexagonal structure
13541,the in vitro permeability study exhibited that both cubic and hexagonal liquid crystal improved the cumulative permeation quantity and permeation rates of tca compared with home made gel
13542,the results of an in vivo transdermal permeability experiment showed that the area under the curve auc
13543,the present work deals with the synthesis of micro structured biomaterials based on chitosan cts for their applications as biocompatible carriers of drugs and bioactive compounds
13544,twelve dispersions were prepared by means of functional cross linking with tricarballylic acid tca they were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry mtdsc and scanning electron microscopy sem and their rheological properties were studied
13545,to the best of the authors knowledge no study has been carried out on the influence of cts concentration degree of cross linking and drug loading on chitosan hydrogels for drug delivery systems dds and is investigated herein for the first time
13546,the influence of dispersion composition polymer concentration and degree of cross linking revealed to exert a marked impact on its rheological properties going from liquid like to viscoelastic gels
13547,the release profiles of a model drug diclofenac sodium dcna as well as their relationships with polymer concentration drug loading and degree of cross linking were evaluated
13548,similar to the findings on rheological properties a wide range of release profiles was encountered
13549,these formulations were found to display a well controlled drug release strongly dependent on the formulation composition
13550,cumulative drug release under physiological conditions for h ranged from to
13551,for comparative purpose voltaren emulgel
13552,the effect of voltaren on the electrical and contractile activity of smooth muscle cells of the rabbit portal vein and the bovine cerebral arteries was studied by sucrose gap method
13553,voltaren was found to rarefy mol l or to suppress mol l spontaneous electrical and contractile activity and to relax the portal vein muscle strips
13554,at concentrations of mol l voltaren caused a dose dependent relaxation of the cerebral arterial muscle strips
13555,the relaxation of the smooth muscles of the blood vessels induced by voltaren is suggested to be due to inhibition of calcium ions influx into muscle cells through different types of calcium channels
13556,to explore the efficacy and safety of weishi bitong xifang fumigation for treating patients with knee osteoarthritis koa
13557,a total of koa patients were randomly assigned to receive weishi bitong xifang fumigation and washing fumigation group n or unctions of votalin emulgel voltaren emulgel group n by means of a computer generated random number table
13558,all the patients received two courses of therapy weeks per course
13559,visual analogue scale vas and western ontario and mcmaster universities osteoarthritis index womac were used to assess the curative effect
13560,visual analogue scale and womac scores were significantly improved in both groups after treatment
13561,however vas stiffness and functional scores in the fumigation group were significantly lower than those in the voltaren emulgel group after weeks of treatment
13562,in addition the occurrence rate of adverse effects in the fumigation group was also lower than that of the voltaren emulgel group
13563,weishi bitong xifang fumigation is an effective and safe method for treating koa patients and should be widely applied in clinics
13564,three groups of rats were infected with trypanosoma brucei
13565,two of the groups were treated with either asteroidal cortisol or a non steroidal voltaren anti inflammatory drug to compare the effects of the two drugs on the disease process
13566,the anaemia was least severe in the cortisol treated group which suggests that its supportive use in the treatment of natural infections with the brucei subgroup of trypanosomes may be advantageous
13567,to review the commercially available ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids identify opportunities for therapeutic substitutions within and outside of their food and drug administration fda approved indications and identify clinically superior drugs within the class for specific indications
13568,a pubmed search through january was performed on the terms diclofenac ketorolac flurbiprofen bromfenac and nepafenac
13569,clinical trials meta analyses and review articles were evaluated if they were written in english and pertained to human subjects
13570,studies were excluded if they were in vitro studies solely evaluated pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties did not relate to the topical ophthalmic route did not evaluate the fda approved indications of any available ophthalmic nsaid or compared a reviewed drug with a nonreviewed drug without placebo comparison
13571,a total of articles met the criteria for evaluation
13572,article quality study design and dosing of the medications were assessed to determine the clinical applicability of the results
13573,the quality of the article was determined using the oxford centre for evidence based medicine levels of evidence
13574,many formulations of the reviewed nsaids have been studied across the primary indications
13575,these indications are pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery pain associated with corneal refractive surgery inhibition of intraoperative miosis and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis
13576,several studies have directly compared drugs within this class and have identified instances in which certain selections are therapeutically superior or equivalent to another
13577,this information provides practitioners with guidance in selecting an optimal medication
13578,diclofenac voltaren geigy and aceclofenac falcol bayer belong to a chemical subgroup of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid that are arylalkanoic groups of phenylacetic acid
13579,hepatotoxicity has been reported with the majority of nsaid although its incidence is not known
13580,we describe two patients who presented hepatic injury after diclofenac and aceclofenac therapy
13581,recognition of cholestasis associated with nsaid may prevent invasive investigations in jaundiced patients
13582,clinically liver injury associated with nsaid is not prevalent but we think it is interesting to report those patients for recognition of the role of certain risk factors and to suggest close monitoring
13583,to determine whether a bandage soft contact lens bscl is routinely needed in the postoperative laser in situ keratomileusis lasik patient and whether topical tetracaine or diclofenac sodium voltaren is more effective in relieving patient discomfort than a bscl
13584,lca vision center toronto ontario canada
13585,in this prospective randomized comparative study all patients had bilateral simultaneous lasik procedures
13586,post lasik patient comfort was evaluated through arms of the study bscl versus no bscl consecutive patients with eye randomized to receive a bscl and no bscl in the fellow eye bscl versus tetracaine consecutive patients with eye randomized to receive a bscl and tetracaine in the fellow eye tetracaine versus voltaren consecutive patients with eye randomized to receive tetracaine and voltaren in the fellow eye
13587,the patient preferences after lasik were as follows bscl versus no bscl versus p bscl versus tetracaine versus p
13588,on average the eyes with no bscl had a line improvement in uncorrected visual acuity over the bscl eyes
13589,tetracaine versus voltaren versus p
13590,the routine use of a bscl in the postoperative lasik patient is not necessary
13591,voltaren and tetracaine were safe and more effective in relieving postoperative patient discomfort and resulted in improved visual acuity immediately postoperatively
13592,we evaluated the effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren drops on patients with hypoxia induced corneal edema
13593,thirty age and sex matched subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups
13594,members of each group received masked solutions of either voltaren voltaren vehicle or a non preserved lubricant cellufresh every hours for hours and then hourly for hours immediately prior to inducing corneal edema in the experimental eye
13595,bilateral ultrasonic pachymetry was performed prior to applying a thick contact lens and light patch on the experimental eye of all subjects for hours
13596,the fellow eye served as the control
13597,following lens removal bilateral corneal thickness was measured every minutes
13598,the percentage change in corneal swelling for each subject and group was calculated
13599,the findings were also normalized to the control eye to minimize diurnal and individual variability
13600,the results were plotted both as percentage change from hour and percentage change normalized to the control eye
13601,corneal swelling ranged from in all groups with recovery at hours
13602,no significant difference was found among the three groups p anova
13603,there was a slight trend toward reduced thickness in the cellufresh group but this was not statistically significant
13604,voltaren does not appear to have an effect on the hypoxia induced corneal edema associated with the production of arachidonic acid pathway metabolites
13605,the effect of antiinflammatory drugs aspirin voltaren cytotoxic drugs cyclophosphamide vincristine antibiotics penicillin chloramphenicol as well as of dipyridamole on the different ultrastructural and metabolic parameters of human platelets was examined in vitro
13606,almost all drugs caused a decreased platelet aggregation but of different degrees
13607,the alteration of the internal structure consisted of a decrease in the number of platelet granules displacement of the granules and mitochondrial damage
13608,the surface alterations affected the number and appearance of platelet pseudopodia
13609,with the exception of voltaren the drugs exerted an inhibitory effect on platelet protein synthesizing capacity and on their phagocytotic ability
13610,voltaren stimulated the ability of platelets to engulf latex particles
13611,the rapid availability of the drug at the site of action followed by maintaining its effect for a long period of time is of great clinical importance
13612,thus the purpose of the present study was to prepare and evaluate multi layered matrix tablets of diclofenac using eudragit rl rs blend to achieve both immediate and sustained therapeutic effects
13613,diclofenac potassium mg was incorporated in an outer immediate release layer to provide immediate pain relief whereas diclofenac sodium mg was incorporated in the inner core to provide extended drug release
13614,wet granulation was employed to prepare the inner core of the tablets that were further layered with an immediate release drug layer in the perforated pan coater
13615,the in vitro and in vivo performance of the developed formulation was compared with the marketed products voltaren sr mg and cataflam mg the in vitro drug release of the prepared formulation showed similarity
13616,diclofenac active ingredient of voltaren has a significant multifaceted role in medicine pharmacy and biochemistry
13617,its physical properties and impact on biomolecular structures still attract essential scientific interest
13618,however its interaction with water has not been described yet at the molecular level
13619,in the present study we shed light on the interaction between the steric hindrance the intramolecular n h o bond etc
13620,carboxylate group co
13621,the tissue concentration of diclofenac sodium the active substance of voltaren sr mg tablets was studied in patients with coxarthrosis
13622,voltaren sr mg tablets were administered twice daily for days then prosthetic joint replacement of the hip was performed
13623,tissue levels of diclofenac were determined by hplc in specimens of articular cartilage synovial membrane and bone obtained during surgery
13624,the results demonstrate that diclofenac was present in all three tissue types after days of therapy
13625,in a controlled trial before having a lower wisdom tooth surgically removed patients were blindly randomized to parallel groups
13626,one group received mg voltaren diclofenac sodium before surgery and then mg times a day for days the other group in sweden widely used fixed combination tablets acetylsalicylic acid mg caffeine mg aprobarbital mg codeine phosphate mg in the highest recommended dose tablets when needed at most times a day
13627,twice a day the patients recorded pain and swelling on mm visual analogue scales
13628,patients treated with voltaren had significantly less pain and swelling p less than
13629,furthermore they had significantly fewer days away from work p less than
13630,the study indicates that visual analogue scales may also be useful in assessment of swelling and that voltaren in a fixed dosage offers a promising alternative against postoperative pain and swelling
13631,the authors describe a fatal case of a group a beta haemolytic streptococci infection
13632,the symptoms seemed to have been initiated by minor skin trauma intramuscular injections of diclofenac voltaren and metoclopramide primperan after which the patient developed extensive muscle necrosis
13633,the clinical course was rapid and he died within hours after the first injection from circulatory collapse probably due to overwhelming septicaemia with group a beta haemolytic streptococci
13634,streptococcal myositis is a rare and extremely serious complication of skin trauma
13635,muscle necrosis is also a known but rare side effect of intramuscular administration of drugs the nicolau syndrome in which non steroid anti inflammatory drugs are often implicated
13636,the case is discussed in the context of this specific syndrome
13637,we report the case of a fungal mycetoma due to madurella mycetomatis that failed to respond to surgery and antifungal treatment but responded strongly to the addition of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid
13638,this african patient was born in mauritania in he was a herdsman living close to the senegal river
13639,the first nodules appeared on the left foot at the age of years
13640,the patient suffered frequent flare ups with the appearance of black grains and underwent surgery in and in senegal
13641,after remission for several months after surgery new fistulae occurred
13642,the patient emigrated to france in and underwent a third surgical intervention in m mycetomatis was cultured from the black grains
13643,the patient was otherwise in good health with no diabetes and hiv tests were negative
13644,we saw the patient for the first time in at which time he had flare ups every two to three months
13645,imaging disclosed an absence of bone involvement
13646,the patient underwent a fourth operation in october and voriconazole treatment was initiated
13647,a new flare up occurred in february ct mri and pet scans revealed calcaneus and tarsal involvement and posaconazole then replaced voriconazole
13648,flucytosine was added four months later due to an absence of improvement
13649,new flares ups occurred and a fifth surgical intervention was performed in september the pain which had been present for three years worsened the patient had to stop working and was no longer able to walk without crutches
13650,amputation of the foot was considered
13651,empiric treatment with a nsaid diclofenac voltaren mg day was added to the antifungal treatment in november to treat the patient s pain and inflammation
13652,a major improvement was observed within one week
13653,the patient was able to walk without crutches one month later
13654,after two months clinical examination was normal no pain inflammation nodules or fistulae
13655,flucytosine was stopped after six months of treatment in january diclofenac after months in october and posaconazole after months also in october no relapse has occurred during the eight years of follow up since treatment ended
13656,the patient seems to have been cured and has normal ct mri and pet scans
13657,this eumycetoma which had progressed over years despite surgery and antifungal treatments seems to have been cured by the addition of a nsaid
13658,this observation suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of fungal mycetoma
13659,clinical studies of treatments including an nsaid should be conducted to confirm this finding
13660,a report is given on a long term controlled trial in which diclofenac sodium voltaren was compared with indomethacin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis both drugs being administered in a dosage of mg daily
13661,in this trial planned as a double blind study each patient was to participate for six months after which the patients treated with diclofenac sodium were to be followed up for a further six months
13662,by the end of the first six months diclofenac sodium had proved to be clearly superior to indomethacin in terms of therapeutic efficacy
13663,moreover unwanted effects referable to either the central nervous system or the gastro intestinal tract were less common and less severe in the patient treated with diclofenac sodium than in those receiving indomethacin
13664,these results demonstrate that when given as long term treatment to patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis voltaren is both effective and well tolerated
13665,the objective of the study was to compare the enteric coated diclofenac sodium voveran the slow release formulation developed in india voveran sr and the internationally marketed formulation voltaren retard
13666,ten healthy volunteers were administered mg each of the three formulations in a three way crossover fashion
13667,blood samples were collected over hours following administration of the drug plasma levels of unchanged drug were determined by gas chromatography
13668,pharmacokinetic parameters for the three formulations were compared
13669,the extent of the drug available from the three formulations was the same as the mean auc values were not significantly different
13670,cmax and mrt values for the two slow release formulations were comparable but were significantly different from the values obtained with the enteric coated formulation
13671,tmax values for the two slow release formulations were similar while the enteric coated tablet had faster time to peak
13672,voveran sr is comparable to voltaren retard and has the distinct advantage of a slow release formulation in that its cmax is much lower and levels are maintained over hours and detectable upto hours
13673,this slow release formulation will offer clinical advantages of better compliance relief of early morning symptoms and better tolerability over long term usage
13674,the binding of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid voltaren and piroxicam to the membranes of erythrocyte ghosts and phosphatidylcholine liposomes was studied by the fluorescent probe method
13675,the drugs were shown to possess high affinity to the both types of the membranes
13676,voltaren was mainly located in the lipid part of erythrocyte ghost membranes while piroxicam was uniformly distributed between the protein and lipid components of the membranes
13677,the findings suggest that the differences in the binding characteristics of the studied nsaid might determine to a certain extent the specificity of their anti inflammatory action
13678,etodolac a member of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids has a poor aqueous solubility
13679,long term administration of etodolac causes severe gastrointestinal disturbances such as peptic ulcer and bleeding
13680,these disturbances could be overcome by alternative routes such as a topical administration
13681,in the present study pluronic lecithin organogels plos were prepared by simple mixing of pluronic solution with lecithin solution
13682,etodolac was loaded into the prepared gels or added during the gel formation
13683,the physicochemical properties of the modified organogels were investigated by different analysis including visual inspection ph determination viscosity spreadability and extrudability
13684,also the in vitro release studies of etodolac in the presence of different penetration enhancers were carried out
13685,the anti inflammatory behavior of the prepared etodolac organogel was investigated using carrageenan induced paw edema test
13686,the results indicated that the prepared organogels showed good physicochemical properties
13687,the organogels containing a combination of tween and oleic acid as penetration enhancers showed the highest percentage of drug release
13688,all tested organogels showed a significant oedema inhibition compared with oral indomethacin and voltaren as a topical marketed anti inflammatory drug
13689,moreover the increase of drug concentration from to w w is accompanied with a longer duration of action up to hrs
13690,therefore the formulated organogels are considered as a promising vehicle for controlled topical delivery of etodolac
13691,in this study a simple and reliable square wave voltammetric swv method was developed and validated for determination of diclofenac in pharmaceutical preparations and human serum
13692,the proposed method was based on electrooxidation of diclofenac at platinum electrode in m tbaclo acetonitrile solution
13693,the well defined two oxidation peaks were observed at and v respectively
13694,calibration curves that were obtained by using current values measured for second peak were linear over the concentration range of g ml and g ml in supporting electrolyte and serum respectively
13695,precision and accuracy were also checked in all media
13696,intra and inter day precision values for diclofenac were less than and accuracy relative error was better than
13697,developed method in this study is accurate precise and can be easily applied to diclomec dicloflam and voltaren tablets as pharmaceutical preparation
13698,also the proposed technique was successfully applied to spiked human serum samples
13699,no electroactive interferences from the endogenous substances were found in human serum
13700,a study was made of the nature and mechanism of interaction of voltaren butadion analgin phenacetin and paracetamol with endoperoxide prostaglandin synthetase pgh synthetase of sheep vesicular glands
13701,activity of the enzyme was measured by polarography with the aid of a clark s electrode
13702,butadion and analgin reversibly inhibited pgh synthetase at concentrations of the order of m whereas voltaren at those of the order of m as regards the mechanism of action butadion and analgin are competitive inhibitors of pgh synthetase in respect to arachidonic acid and uncompetitive inhibitors in respect to the electron donor adrenaline
13703,phenacetin administered at concentrations up to x m did not inhibit pgh synthetase whereas paracetamol m increased its catalytic activity apparently due to the electron donor properties
13704,deficiency of vitamin a in rats caused a decrease in metabolic rate of acetanilide as well as in elimination of voltaren from blood plasma while excess of the vitamin iu kg stimulated voltaren elimination and increased excretion with urine of aminophenol conjugates of acetanilide with sulfuric and glucuronic acids
13705,under conditions of vitamin a deficiency formation of acetanilide toxic metabolites was increased as a result of which excretion of mercapturic acids with urine was elevated but excess of vitamin a and its hyperdose inhibited these reactions
13706,at the same time deficiency of vitamin a amplified the paracetamol and voltaren toxicity and its excess exhibited protective effects
13707,the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of diclofenac sodium from a new sustained release formulation effekton and from a standard sustained release formulation voltaren retard were compared in healthy adult male volunteers
13708,after a single oral dose of mg effekton a mean maximal plasma concentration cmax of ng ml was obtained after h tmax
13709,after an identical dose of voltaren retard a peak plasma concentration of ng ml was obtained after h plasma levels of diclofenac were determined by a new hplc assay which was developed as part of this study and makes possible monitoring plasma levels of diclofenac for h after a single dose
13710,the mean bioavailability of diclofenac from effekton was relative to that of voltaren retard
13711,as the rate and the extent of absorption of diclofenac sodium was not significantly different after the administration of the two investigated formulations it can be concluded that effekton is bioequivalent to voltaren retard
13712,sixty patients were treated in the emergency ward for biliary colic
13713,cholelithiasis was proven by ultrasonography
13714,twenty patients group i were treated by placebo
13715,twenty patients group ii were treated by papaverine and patients were treated by diclofenac sodium voltaren group iii
13716,twenty more patients group iv with low back pain lbp were treated with diclofenac sodium voltaren as a control to assess the analgesic effect of voltaren
13717,two interesting observations were made voltaren was proven more efficient for pain relief p less than and none of the patients treated with voltaren were in need of hospitalization and immediate surgery
13718,in comparison nine patients of the other two groups progressed to acute cholecystitis and needed surgical intervention
13719,the possible anticolic and anti biliary inflammation properties and the indications for use of voltaren are discussed
13720,anaphylaxis due to diclofenac sodium voltaren is rare
13721,we describe a year old woman who received a suppository of diclofenac for analgesia hours after cesarean section
13722,she developed severe angioedema and profound hemodynamic shock minutes after the diclofenac to which she had been exposed in the past without any side effects
13723,there are few reports of such an acute life threatening multisystem reaction to this drug in the english literature
13724,thirty one patients with acute renal colic were treated with voltaren diclofenac sodium ciba
13725,the drug proved to be suitable for relieving and stopping pain
13726,adverse effects were observed but in few cases
13727,for this reason authors suggest a more extensive use of the drug
13728,electrocardiography and tetrapolar rheoplethysmography of the finger have demonstrated that voltaren and nk activity produce an adverse action on the coronary blood flow in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
13729,it has been found possible to correct the induced disorders by cordarone
13730,the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren and of prostaglandin e pge on spermatogenesis in mature dogs has been studied
13731,diclofenac sodium at mg kg was given subcutaneously once a day for days
13732,the testes were biopsied every days and spermatogenesis was quantified showing a marked and statistically significant increase p less than
13733,administration of pge in doses of mg kg subcutaneously once a day for days produced a marked and statistically significant decrease in spermatogenesis p less than and an increase in the numbers of exfoliated immature germ cells in the seminiferous tubule lumens
13734,the efficacy of the combined use of immunostimulants and anti inflammatory agents such as acetylsalicylic acid voltaren indomethacin and naproxen was studied in carragenin induced experimental inflammation
13735,noninbred albino mice of both sexes were used in the experiments
13736,it was shown that prodigiosan as a therapeutic agent had a pronounced anti inflammatory action
13737,it potentiated the effect of voltaren used in a dose lower than the ed and did not change the anti inflammatory activity of naproxen indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid used in the doses equal to the ed
13738,the potentiating effect of prodigiosan on voltaren was statistically significant methyluracil used as a prophylactic agent had an anti inflammatory effect
13739,levamisole used as a prophylactic agent or a therapeutic agent did not decrease the edema level
13740,the anti inflammatory effect of naproxen indomethacin acetylsalicylic acid and voltaren did not change when the drugs were administered to the animals treated with methyluracil and levamisole
13741,guinea pigs infested with trichinella larvae per g body weight at the intestinal at days of infection migration al at days and muscular at days stages of invasion were given voltaren mg kg daily and mebendazole mg kg daily
13742,the amount of adult trichinella in small intestine and larvae in the diaphragm t and b lymphocyte count t rec and b rfc functional leukocyte activity in rtml for fga and trichinella larvae antigens content of circulating immune complexes and complement were determined
13743,voltaren did not cause delay in adult trichinella elimination from the intestine of experimental animals it also did not increase invasion rate at the muscular stage
13744,as compared to the control t and b lymphocyte content and rtml for fga remained unaltered
13745,experimental animals show elevated blood complement activity and rtml inhibition of trichinella antigens
13746,the combination of mebendasole and voltaren did not reduce parasitogenic effect
13747,despite the terms of drug injection t and b lymphocytes count and complement levels in blood were found to increase as well as the rtml index on fga and its inhibition of specific antigens as compared with the infected untreated animals
13748,the multifactorial basis of gastro intestinal gi damage from nsaids includes effects of these drugs in producing microvascular injury
13749,increased lipoxygenase lo activity reflected in production in the gastric efferent circulation of leukotriene c is shown in pigs given i g
13751,blockade of lo activity by highly selective inhibitors of this enzyme inhibits production of both gastric and intestinal leukotrienes lt in rats and mice
13752,long term effects of nsaids were investigated in pigs and human volunteers
13753,in pigs gastric ulcers occurred from oral diclofenac voltaren tablets mg kg d for d without significant blood loss fe rbcs emphasizing limitations in measuring blood loss to relate this to pathology in the gi tract
13754,diclofenac induced increase in leukotriene production was reversed by concurrent misoprostol indicating that this drug could have effects other than replenishing pg prostaglandin e in the mucosa
13755,in male human volunteers given nsaids for d a relation was established between reduced pg production in the antrum and ulcerogenic effects in this region but not in the fundus
13756,these results emphasize the importance of examining mechanisms of action of nsaids under long term dosage conditions to determine their variable effects
13757,we compared the effects of nf b inhibitor aurothiomalate and voltaren on no production by mouse macrophages in vitro their ability to cause local edema at the site of injection and their effect on carrageenan induced inflammation
13758,high concentrations of aurothiomalate reduced no production while in low concentrations both aurothiomalate and voltaren stimulated this process
13759,when injected into mouse footpad aurothiomalate in a dose mm and voltaren in a dose m induce paw edema
13760,both compounds suppressed carrageenan induced inflammation but the efficacy of aurothiomalate fold exceeded that of voltaren
13761,the effect of the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren on spermatogenesis in infertile oligospermic patients has been studied
13762,diclofenac sodium was given orally at a daily dose of mg for days
13763,seminal fluid parameters were evaluated
13764,group ii with high levels of seminal prostaglandin showed a statistically significant increase in the number and motility of spermatozoa p less than whilst no significant variations were observed in patients of group i with normal values of seminal prostaglandin
13765,this study evaluates the prophylactic effect of the peripherally selective mu opioid receptor agonist loperamide administered topically in a liposomal gel formulation on pain inflammation and disease progression in the adjuvant induced model of experimental rheumatoid arthritis in female lewis rats
13766,in a randomized blinded and controlled animal trial aia rats were divided into six groups consisting of eleven rats per group based on the following treatments loperamide liposomal gel free loperamide gel empty liposomal gel diclofenac gel voltaren no treatment and naive control
13767,topical formulations were applied daily for a maximum of days starting from day at the same time as immunization
13768,the time course of the effect of the treatments on antinocieption and inflammation was assessed using a paw pressure analgesiometer and plethysmometer respectively
13769,arthritis progression was scored daily using an established scoring protocol
13770,at the end of the study hind paws were processed for histological analysis
13771,administration of loperamide liposomal gel daily across the duration of the study produced significant peripheral antinociception as expected however increased the severity of inflammation and accelerated arthritis progression
13772,this was indicated by an increase in paw volume behavioral and observational scoring and histological analysis compared to the control groups
13773,in particular histology results showed an increase in pannus formation and synovial inflammation as well as an upregulation of markers of inflammation and angiogenesis
13774,these findings may have implications for the use of loperamide and other opioids in arthritis and potentially other chronic inflammatory diseases
13775,to compare the tolerability of preserved diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha and preservative free diclofenac dicloftil
13776,thirty healthy volunteers received a single drop of voltaren ophtha in eye and a single drop of dicloftil in the other
13777,both drops were instilled at the same time in a single blind manner
13778,visual analog scale grading was used to measure ocular discomfort itch burn and pain
13779,grading was obtained before drop instillation and after s min min min and min
13780,both preparations caused discomfort itch burn and pain with a peak effect on all parameters at min
13781,however preservative free dicloftil proved to be more tolerable than preserved voltaren ophtha
13782,data show significantly lower reported levels of discomfort and itch up to min lower levels of burn at the first minute and less pain immediately after instillation
13783,this is the first study to compare subjective ocular tolerability of a single drop
13784,our results indicate that dicloftil has better tolerability than voltaren ophtha
13785,ophthalmologists should be aware of this significant difference when prescribing diclofenac especially in patients with low compliance or who require prolonged therapy
13786,diclofenac sodium is the active ingredient in voltaren a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug designed by selection of appropriate physicochemical and steric properties
13787,its pharmacologic activity specifically its effects in acute and subchronic inflammation and its analgesic activity have been assessed in animal models
13788,the tolerability of the compound as judged by several parameters i e ratio between the acute lethal dose or the dose inducing gastrointestinal blood loss and the desired pharmacologic activity is favorable in comparison with other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs
13789,diclofenac sodium acts by potent cyclo oxygenase inhibition reduction of arachidonic acid release and enhancement of arachidonic acid uptake
13790,it thereby results in a dual inhibitory effect on both the cyclo oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways
13791,the baseline permeability of small bowel in healthy volunteers was assessed by measuring the mannitol and chromium edta recovery in a hour urine collection after ingestion of a drink containing a mixture of g of mannitol and mbq of cr edta
13792,subjects were treated with medication for week followed by permeability studies as described above
13793,the regimens used were diclofenac sodium voltaren mg po tid subjects voltaren sr mg bid for week subjects indomethacin mg tid subjects and tenoxicam mobiflex mg daily subjects
13794,there was no significant difference between the mannitol recoveries at baseline or after any of the drugs
13795,the permeability was clearly increased by indomethacin and by voltaren sr conventional release voltaren increased permeability but the results were not significantly above baseline
13796,mobiflex had no influence on the measured permeability
13797,our results suggest that the sr preparation of diclofenac has a more pronounced effect than regular diclofenac sodium thus different nsaids and different preparations of the same nsaid may have different effects on small bowel permeability
13798,voltaren a non steroid antiinflammatory agent nsa of an entirely new chemical structure is characterized by the high degree of antiinflammatory antipyretic and analgesic activity it displays in animal experiments
13799,like other nsas the preparation inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and various findings indicate that the spectrum of pharmacological activity of these agents is at least partly due to this inhibitory effect
13800,despite this common feature however there are quantitative and qualitative differences between voltaren and other nsas
13801,a year old hispanic man who had bilateral radial keratotomy rk and astigmatic keratotomy ak in his right eye year previously went swimming in a lake
13802,he subsequently developed foreign body sensation and pain with a gradual decrease in vision over the following weeks despite treatment with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride ciloxan and diclofenac sodium voltaren
13803,the patient sought a second opinion
13804,on examination best corrected visual acuity was in the right eye and in the left
13805,slitlamp examination revealed mild conjunctival and scleral injection and a mm diameter stromal infiltrate densest at the edges figure
13806,the infiltrate involved one rk and one ak incision with gaping of both approximately depth incisions figure
13807,the anterior chamber was deep and quiet
13808,examination was otherwise unremarkable
13809,the cornea was scraped but the smears were negative
13810,the ciloxan and voltaren were stopped and scopolamine four times a day was started
13811,cultures for aerobic anaerobic fungal acid fast bacilli and acanthamoeba were performed but showed no growth in the following week
13812,except for vascular ingrowth there was no change in the appearance of the microbial keratitis during this week
13813,an incisional biopsy and rescraping were performed but there was again no growth of micro organisms and no change in the microbial keratitis in the following days
13814,how would you manage this patient at this time
13815,it has been established that oral administration of indomethacin mg kg to albino rats for one week leads to a decline in the level of reduced and an increase in the level of oxidized glutathione with a simultaneous activation of liver glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase
13816,administration of the drug for two weeks makes the indicators under study return in the main to normal
13817,the raising of the drug dose up to mg kg makes the total content of glutathione fall at the expense of its reduced form
13818,the activity of the enzymes significantly rises in all the observation periods days after administration
13819,the use of voltaren in doses of and mg kg does not produce any action on the glutathione forms or glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver
13820,in a double blind comparison with placebo in patients suffering from post operative pain following the surgical removal of a third molar in the lower jaw statistical analyses showed that voltaren diclofenac sodium in a single dose of mg had a significantly greater analgesic effect than placebo
13821,the technique to be used for studies with analgesic drugs is briefly discussed
13822,to investigate the effect of antipyretics on the murine and poultry models of influenzal encephalitis we injected large quantities of antipyretics acetylsalicylic acid aspirin and dicrofenac sodium voltaren
13823,the effect of antipyretic treatment on the murine encephalitis model was unremarkable histologically and immunohistochemically
13824,whereas in chicks cns lesions consisting of perivascular cuffing and gliosis appeared only in those animals treated with the antipyretics and viral antigen was detected mainly in the nuclei of glial cells or vascular endothelia of voltaren treated animals
13825,we here demonstrate that antipyretic treatment aggravated the hematogenous spread of the influenza virus to the cns in chicks but did not affect the transneural infection in mice
13826,fifty six patients with renal or ureteric colic were entered into a randomised prospective double blind investigation of the analgesic efficacy and tolerance of voltaren versus ketogan both administered intramuscularly
13827,there were no significant differences regarding pain relief but side effects were fewer in patients treated with voltaren
13828,a case of apparent anaphylactic reaction to diclofenac sodium voltaren is reported
13829,a year old man collapsed min after intramuscular injection of diclofenac for treatment of low back pain
13830,twenty minutes following successful resuscitation he went into coma from which he never recovered and was pronounced dead on the following day
13831,to our knowledge this is the first reported case of anaphylactic reaction to diclofenac
13832,a year old woman developed severe and recurrent scleritis and uveitis after neodymium yag capsulotomy performed months after cataract extraction
13833,four cracks on the intraocular lens and plastic splinters in the vitreous indicated that excessive laser energy had been used
13834,inflammation was treated successfully only when a combination of dexamethasone acetate drops maxidex drops of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha and systemic diclofenac sodium voltaren was used
13835,inflammation might be explained by chronic irritation of the ciliary body by a displaced haptic or by an immune reaction triggered by damage to the ciliary body at the time of excessive posterior capsulotomy
13836,hydrophilic matrices especially hpmc based are widely used to provide sustained delivery where drug release occurs mainly by diffusion
13837,a full factorial design was used to develop and evaluate hpmc matrix tablet for sustained delivery of diclofenac
13838,the influences of polymer concentration viscosity diluent type ratio drug load solubility compression force and ph change on drug release were investigated
13839,ten tablet formulations were prepared using wet granulation
13840,hpmc km w w was used as the polymer forming matrix
13841,the release kinetics compatibility studies lot reproducibility and effect on storage were discussed
13842,increasing polymer concentration and compression force showed antagonistic effect on release rate
13843,mannitol tends to increase release rate more than lactose
13844,reversing diluent ratio between lactose and mcc did not affect drug release
13845,changing ph resulted in burst release whereas drug solubility is ph independent
13846,f showed similar release to voltaren sr and followed higuchi model
13847,drug and polymer were compatible to each other
13848,the formulation is stable at long and intermediate conditions with a significant increase in release rate at accelerated conditions due to water uptake and polymer swelling
13849,the developed formulation was successful for a sustained delivery of diclofenac
13850,treatment of the adjuvant disease in rats by intragastric administration of voltaren or indomethacin mg kg was followed by approximately equal anti inflammatory and analgesic effects on the affected joints
13851,in this case the development of active dystrophic changes in the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys was observed
13852,at combined administration of the antiphlogistics with trental there was noted an enhancement of their therapeutic action on the joints and also a weakening of the ulcerogenic effect and nephrotoxicity that was reflected in the clinical pathological morphological and laboratory studies
13854,a short term trial has been performed under double blind conditions in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis to compare diclofenac sodium voltaren with both indomethacin and placebo for efficacy and tolerability
13855,the duration of the trial was two weeks and was a between patient comparison of mg t i d
13856,diclofenac sodium mg t i d
13857,indomethacin or placebo using a double dummy technique
13858,forty eight patients completed the trial
13859,in the majority of parameters examined diclofenac sodium was superior to placebo and indomethacin in therapeutic effect
13860,one patient was withdrawn from the trial because of intolerance to indomethacin and one other because of severe joint pain under indomethacin therapy
13861,neither active compound caused clinically significant changes in blood picture or urine analysis
13862,we compared the effect of nf b inhibitor aurothiomalate and voltaren on local inflammation in different types of immune response
13863,both substances reduced edema caused by sheep erythrocytes th type immune response and local immediate type hypersensitivity response induced with ovalbumin th dependent response
13864,the anti inflammatory effects of aurothiomalate were similar to those of voltaren during th type immune response
13865,the hepatotropic effect of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid such as indomethacin voltaren piroxicam phenylbutazon mefenamic acid was studied
13866,it was found that according to their level of the pharmacological protection of the liver against tetrachlormethan these agents may be arranged in the following sequence mefenamic acid phenylbutazon voltaren piroxicam
13867,the hepatoprotective effect of nsaid correlates with the antioxidant properties and fails to correlate with the antioxidant ones
13868,the hepatotoxic effect of nsaid was determined by their ability to suppress synthesis of prostaglandins
13869,following several years of development and validation we applied the womac osteoarthritis index as the principal outcome measure in a double blind randomized parallel trial of meclomen mg po tid and voltaren mg po tid
13870,statistically significant improvements in clinical status were noted in both treatment groups
13871,at the doses studied between drug differences favoring meclomen were observed in pain and stiffness no difference being noted in physical function
13872,no significant between drug difference was noted in tolerability at these same doses
13873,our study also demonstrated that the relative efficiency of womac was similar to that of the lequesne and doyle indices
13874,finally we defined the standard deviation necessary to calculate sample size for future studies using the womac index both for studies based on static scores and those based on change scores
13875,despite the traditional use of bergia ammannioides henye ex roth
13876,elatinaceae for the treatment of wounds in india there is a scarcity of scientific data supporting this use
13877,the objective of this study is to assess wound healing potentiality of the plant to study pharmacological activities that may contribute in eliminating wound complications and to investigate the biologically active fractions
13878,the ethanolic extract etoh of the aerial parts was fractionated to obtain n hexane hxfr chloroform clfr ethyl acetate etfr and n butanol buoh fractions
13879,etoh and its fractions were formulated in strength of and w w ointment and tested for wound healing activity using the excision model
13880,the topical anti inflammatory in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activities were evaluated
13881,hxfr and etfr were chemically investigated to isolate their constituents
13882,application of etoh hxfr and etfr w w ointments leads to and healing of the wounds with an increase in the collagen content
13883,hxfr had the strongest anti inflammatory potency relative to voltaren and antibacterial activity mic g ml against staphylococcus aureus while etfr showed the strongest antioxidant activity against dpph abts and super oxide radical with an ic value of and g ml respectively
13884,sitosterol lupeol cyclolaudenol and cycloartenol were isolated from hxfr
13885,quercetin ellagic acid kaempferol o l rhamnoside and quercetin o l rhamnoside were isolated from etfr
13886,our study presents scientific evidence for the efficacy of b ammannioides in enhancing wound healing and the first isolation of cyclolaudenol and cycloartenol from bergia
13887,to compare the efficacy and short term safety of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha ciba vision and of sodium chloride ophthalmic solution in the treatment of filamentary keratitis fk in patients with dry eye syndrome due to secondary sj gren s syndrome
13888,thirty two patients eyes with dry eye syndrome due to secondary sj gren syndrome were enrolled in a randomized study patients and authors were aware of which medication was being used
13889,all patients had fk
13890,sixteen patients were treated with sodium chloride drops and patients received diclofenac sodium eyedrops
13891,treatment regimen included instillation of drop times a day for days for both groups
13892,clinical assessment was performed once a week during the study period
13893,data on the efficacy and safety of the different therapeutic regimens were collected and compared
13894,both medications achieved disappearance of filaments at the end of the study
13895,treatment with diclofenac sodium revealed a significantly more rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms as compared with sodium chloride
13896,no significant adverse effects were observed in both groups
13897,diclofenac sodium may be an effective and safe topical therapy in patients with fk caused by secondary sj gren s disease
13898,phase i randomized controlled patch studies were conducted to evaluate skin sensitization and irritation potential of a new gel formulation containing diclofenac and menthol as a fixed combination product in study a healthy volunteers were exposed to test patches containing diclofenac menthol diclofenac menthol or placebo gels during an induction nine to h applications and challenge phase one h application
13899,some subjects were re challenged to evaluate suspected sensitization
13900,study b participants underwent consecutive h patch applications of the treatments from study a sodium lauryl sulfate positive control saline and a marketed gel diclofenac voltaren
13901,application sites were visually scored by blinded observers for skin sensitization irritation in study a of participants showed minimal erythema and signs of glazing and peeling with diclofenac menthol by the end of the induction phase which diminished during the challenge phase
13902,similar patterns were seen with menthol gel
13903,only subject exhibited possible sensitization to diclofenac menthol
13904,in study b mean cumulative irritation score with diclofenac menthol was significantly higher
13905,in a placebo controlled double blind between patient trial the antipyretic effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren was studied in forty three children ranging from years of age
13906,all patients were hospitalized because of acute illness associated with fever degrees c degrees c mean degrees c due to viral or bacterial infections
13907,the trial medication was given in the form of suppositories containing mg of diclofenac sodium or as matching placebo to children aged from years
13908,the children aged from years received a mg diclofenac sodium suppository or placebo
13909,body temperature and pulse rate were measured at the time of administration and after and hours
13910,the results showed a return to normal temperature values after hours in all patients receiving diclofenac sodium whereas in the placebo group only minimal changes were observed
13911,no unwanted effects were reported
13912,superior mesenteric artery occlusion leads to mesenteric ischemia activation of arachidonic acid metabolism and release of endotoxins into the systemic circulation
13913,the effect of leukotriene and prostaglandin antagonists on hemodynamic response and survival of rats after superior mesenteric artery sma occlusion was investigated
13914,the animals were divided into five groups in group n the sma was clamped for h and mortality assessed after h group animals n were pretreated with mg kg indomethacin and the sma clamped similarly to group group animals n were pretreated with mg kg voltaren group animals n received mg kg bw c before mesenteric artery occlusion and group animals n were pretreated with mg diethylcarbamazine
13915,the blood pressure and pulse response as well as histologic appearance of the bowel h after declamping was similar in all five groups
13916,the mortality rate after h was in the control group with indomethacin treatment with voltaren with bw c and with diethylcarbamazine
13917,the mortality rate in all the treated groups was not significantly different from the control group
13918,plasma thromboxane b levels were inhibited significantly by indomethacin and voltaren and to a lesser extent by bw c
13919,there was a paradoxical rise in thromboxane b following diethylcarbamazine treatment
13920,it is concluded that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and or the lipoxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid did not alter the hemodynamic response and mortality following h of acute superior mesenteric artery occlusion
13921,subjects were treated with voltaren mg per day for days or with naproxen mg per day and asa g per day
13922,in all patients the physiological excretion of blood from the intestine markedly increased to a very great extent with naproxen and asa
13923,from this aspect voltaren is highly significantly superior in maximal doses to the other two medicaments
13924,in order to evaluate the absorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa colonoscopy was used to investigate in six healthy volunteers the colonic absorption of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac voltaren
13925,oral and colonic administration of mg of diclofenac resulted in comparable peak plasma concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration time curves
13926,the apparent relative availability of diclofenac from the colon compared to the oral form which was assumed to be ranged from to with a mean of
13927,there was no difference in absorption between application of the drug in the cecum and in the splenic flexure
13928,this new indication for colonoscopy proved to be simple well tolerated and well suited for phase i studies with new drugs or formulations
13929,diclofenac sodium ds a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug has a bitter taste and is a local stomach irritant
13930,the aim of this study was to formulate taste masked ds orally dispersible tablets odts with targeted drug release in the intestine
13931,pellets of ds were designed using sugar sphere cores layered with ds followed by an enteric coat of eudragit l and a second coat of eudragit e for taste masking
13932,the produced pellets had a high loading efficiency of with diameters ranging from to m
13933,the prepared pellets were spherical with smooth surfaces on scanning electron microscopy examination
13934,pellets with the enteric coat eudragit l followed by eudragit e resulted in ds release in simulated gastric fluid sgf and complete dissolution in simulated intestinal fluid sif
13935,the pellets were then used to formulate odts
13936,parenteral diclofenac is frequently used for analgesia following minor orthopedic interventions
13937,currently available diclofenac formulations are for intramuscular im or intravenous injection
13938,a new ml volume formulation of diclofenac containing hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd allows both sc and im administration
13939,the objective of this open label randomized parallel group active controlled study was to assess the safety and efficacy of mg diclofenac hp cd administered sc or im compared with im voltaren mg in inpatients undergoing minor orthopedic surgeries with moderate to severe postoperative pain
13940,a total of patients were randomized to treatment
13941,surgery related pain was comparable between groups before treatment and rapidly declined in all patients following diclofenac injection
13942,the primary endpoint was investigator assessed local tolerability up to hours postinjection redness swelling and hardening at the injection site each scored on a point scale where none mild moderate and severe
13943,local tolerability was found to be optimal for all the injected formulations with mean overall scores to of and for diclofenac hp cd sc diclofenac hp cd im and voltaren im respectively
13944,consistently the overall tolerability as judged by the patients and investigators was reported as good or excellent in more than of cases in all groups
13945,overall the study results indicate that safety and efficacy were similar irrespective of the diclofenac formulation used thus the new sc diclofenac hp cd has an acceptable tolerability profile and may be considered a valid alternative to im delivered diclofenac formulations
13946,in attempts to design delayed release tablets of diclofenac sodium seven experimental batches were produced
13947,the influence of super disintegrant croscarmellose sodium ccs the granulation process and the thickness of eudragit l coating film were evaluated
13948,the values of dissolution efficiency and the similarity factor were used to compare the dissolution profiles of each experimental batch and the reference voltaren
13949,both methods appear to be applicable and useful in comparing dissolution profiles
13950,based on such values four batches were considered similar when contrasted with the reference
13951,the results suggest an optimal relationship between the amount of ccs and the thickness of the coating film which provides appropriate dissolution rate of diclofenac sodium from the dosage forms
13952,non narcotic analgesics benzofurocaine and voltaren of ld were shown to exert the protective effect on rats in castor oil induced diarrhea to decrease in mice the degree of pain reaction under the influence of acetylcholine acetic acid and thermic stimulation
13953,skin pretreatment with a microneedle roller microporation mp appears a simple and inexpensive technique to increase transdermal delivery of topically applied drug products
13954,this study investigates the effect of mp on the passive and iontophoretic delivery of diclofenac dcf by quantifying dermis and plasma levels of dcf in a rabbit model
13955,new zealand albino female rabbits received either i a topical application of g of voltaren gel with or without pretreatment with a microroller mm needle length density microneedles per cm area or ii a dcf solution mg ml via iontophoresis iomed transq e medium size patch with or without microroller pretreatment
13956,a a cm cathodic current was applied for min for a total of ma
13957,dcf concentrations were monitored in dermis with microdialysis sampling every min for h plasma samples were collected over the same period
13958,in the passive delivery studies microroller pretreatment increased cmax by and fold in skin and plasma respectively and auc by and fold in skin and plasma respectively
13959,in the iontophoresis delivery studies microporation increased cmax by fold both in skin and in plasma and auc by and fold in skin and plasma respectively
13960,in conclusion microneedle pretreatment increased significantly the systemic exposure of dcf from either passive or iontophoretic delivery whereas the effect in skin was less pronounced
13961,one percent voltaren gel a new drug manufactured by ciba geigy correction of sib geigi switzerland was used in the treatment of patients with psoriasis in the progressive stage and psoriatic arthritis symptoms
13962,the drug is characterized by antiinflammatory analgesic and antipyretic effects
13963,no side effects or complications were recorded in the course of voltaren gel therapy
13964,the drug has proved highly effective and is recommended for wide practice
13965,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are particularly used in patients with bone fractures but there are limited studies on whether one nsaid is superior to another
13966,in this study we used histopathological and biochemical parameters to determine whether there are differences between the effects of the administration of clinical doses of dexketoprofen trometamol dext meloxicam mel and diclofenac sodium dic on the healing of closed fibular fractures and the toxicity of both the liver and kidney
13967,twenty eight male sprague dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups of seven each
13968,closed diaphyseal fractures were formed in the left fibulas of all of the rats
13969,the nsaids dexketoprofen trometamol dext arveles meloxicam mel melox and diclofenac sodium dic voltaren were intramuscularly administered to groups i ii and iii respectively for a period of days after the fibular fractures were performed
13970,no pharmacological agents were administered to group iv control group
13971,blood samples were collected from all of the rats after the fractures were performed and the rats were sacrificed on day the histopathological findings were compared and the blood samples were evaluated to determine any differences between the levels of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and malondialdehyde mda
13972,our results suggest that dext and mel impair the healing of bone fractures and that dic does not histopathologically affect the healing process of bone fractures
13973,we also found that dext mel and dic impaired the renal histopathology compared with the control group
13974,however the liver histopathological analysis showed that dext and mel caused a higher degree of parenchymal necrosis compared with dic
13975,based on our results dic can be considered a relatively safe medication in patients with fractures
13976,the influence of different n octenylsuccinate starch as formulations i e
13977,as solutions and an as stabilized emulsion system on the in vitro corneal permeation behaviour of sodium diclofenac dfna was investigated and compared to the commercial product voltaren ophtha vo
13978,although saturation concentrations of dfna achieved with polyoxethylene castor oil poc which is the solubilizing additive in vo are higher than those achieved with as at varying ph values it was found that as solutions yield higher dfna permeation rates than vo or a poc solution
13979,however permeation is extremely reduced with rising as concentrations or as emulsions
13980,neither ph value or nor presence of preservative seem to have an impact on permeation activity
13981,in order to assess possible cytotoxic effects of the preparations investigated red blood cell haemolysis studies were performed with different preparations containing dfna
13982,none of the tested as formulations showed significantly high haemolytic data
13983,on the other hand the high in vitro haemolysis obtained with vo is primarily based on an osmotic effect caused by boric acid
13984,the c aminopyrine breath test is a simple procedure for the non invasive determination of the microsomal function of the liver
13985,after the oral administration of a tracer dose of microci kbq of c aminopyrine the co activity of the expired breath air is determined in hourly intervals
13986,there is a close correlation between its decrease and the elimination of aminopyrine from the plasma
13987,both the elimination constant of co kbreath and the maximal specific co activity are useful quantitative parameters of the test
13988,they allow conclusions as to the hepatic demethylation capacity
13989,both parameters were significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in control patients
13990,the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenacsodium voltaren did not significantly influence the demethylation of c aminopyrine in patients with rheumatic diseases and in healthy probands
13991,further experiences with the breath test are necessary especially with respect to its suitability for prospective investigations
13992,diclofenac loaded phospholipid vesicles namely conventional liposomes ethosomes and pevs penetration enhancer containing vesicles were developed and their efficacy in tpa phorbol ester induced skin inflammation was examined
13993,vesicles were made from a cheap and unpurified mixture of phospholipids and diclofenac sodium transcutol p and propylene glycol were added to obtain pevs and ethanol to produce ethosomes
13994,the structure and lamellar organization of the vesicle bilayer were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and small and wide angle x ray scattering as well as the main physico chemical features
13995,the formulations along with a diclofenac solution and commercial voltaren emulgel were tested in a comparative trial for anti inflammatory efficacy on tpa treated mice dorsal skin
13996,vesicles were around nm negatively charged able to encapsulate diclofenac in good yields and disclosed different lamellarity as a function of the formulation composition
13997,vesicular formulations promoted drug accumulation and reduced the permeation
13998,administration of vesicular diclofenac on tpa inflamed skin resulted in marked attenuation of oedema and leucocyte infiltration especially using pevs
13999,histology confirmed the effectiveness of vesicles since they provided an amelioration of the tissual damage induced by tpa
14000,the proposed approach based on vesicular nanocarriers may hold promising therapeutic value for treating a variety of inflammatory skin disorders
14001,to investigate the therapeutic effect and the impact on liver function of different dose tripterygium wilfordii compound recipe gel twcg for external use on adjuvant induced arthritis aa rats
14002,freund s adjuvant induced arthritis rats were dressed with different doses of twcg voltaren as positive control and blank gel as blank control
14003,the ankle swelling degrees were evaluated the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor tnf and interleukin il were detected by elisa the levels of matrix metalloproteinase mmp in ankle cartilage were determined by immunohistochemical method the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast were tested with the automatic biochemical analyzer
14004,compared with the model group dressed with blank gel the ankle swelling degrees in twcg groups and voltaren group were significantly reduced p the levels of tnf markedly decreased and il increased in sera p the content of mmp in ankle joint tissues was significantly reduced p
14005,the effects in high dose twcg group and median dose twcg group were better than that in voltaren group and low dose twcg group p
14006,however the levels of alt and ast were not statistically different among the groups p
14007,twcg has obvious anti inflammatory and detumescence effects on aa rat
14008,it can protect cartilage tissue effectively without significant hepatotoxicity
14009,enteral administration of oxymethyluracil in non inbred albino rats decreased the inflammatory reaction to histamine serotonin bradykinin carrageenan and trypsin being similar to voltaren and reduced granulomatous inflammation but influenced the proliferation to a lower extent than did voltaren
14010,in contrast to voltarcen oxymethyluracil also exhibited gastroprotective antiulcer properties
14011,in a double blind crossover study conducted in ten hospitalised patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis the anti inflammatory effect of diclofenac sodium voltaren in a daily dosage of mg was compared with that of placebo under strictly standardised conditions
14012,changes in reversible articular swelling were determined by measuring the circumference of involved wrist knee metacarpophalangeal interphalangeal and metatarosphalangeal joints
14013,a consistent decrease in joint swelling occurred in response to treatment with diclofenac sodium as compared with a consistent increase following placebo medication
14014,this difference was significant at the level for all except the interphalangeal joints
14015,similarly in response to diclofenac sodium a greater improvement was noted in duration of morning stiffness and grip strength and a greater reduction in the total number of painful and swollen joints
14016,the status of the rheumatoid condition improved in nine patients following treatment with diclofenac sodium but in none following placebo medication
14017,two patients reported unwanted effects consisting of a sensation of fullness during treatment with diclofenac sodium in one case and of heartburn during both treatment periods in the other
14018,no laboratory abnormalities were noted
14019,the new antirheumatic agent diclofenac sodium voltaren has been compared with indometacin with respect to tolerance and effect on osteoarthritic symptoms
14020,in a double blind trial two groups of arthritic patients each received voltaren and indometacin respectively for weeks
14021,the initial dose for both drugs was mg per day
14022,where the effect was inadequate the dose could be raised to mg daily
14023,the outcome revealed no significant differences of the effect and tolerance between the two drugs
14024,an earlier onset of effect however was observed in the voltaren group
14025,as measured on an inflamed rat paw voltaren raised the pain sensitivity threshold fold whereas on a non inflamed paw fold
14026,the effect seen was dose dependent
14027,methindole yielded to voltaren as regards analgetic action determined on inflamed tissues
14028,the method of mechanical irritation of inflamed tissues modified by the authors provides more complete information on analgetic action of non steroidal anti inflammatory agents as compared to other methods
14029,the authors studied the tolerance of three nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs voltaren indomethacin and ibuprofen by rats at different times of pregnancy and compared voltaren tolerance by pregnant and nonpregnant females
14030,it was shown that as compared to nonpregnant animals pregnant animals tolerated voltaren more poorly
14031,the tolerance of both voltaren and indomethacin was particularly poor in the last trimester of pregnancy
14032,the enhancement of the drug toxicity during pregnancy because of the changes in body function is discussed
14033,fever should be treated according to the individual situation
14034,securing a sufficient fluid intake is the most important primary measure
14035,the decrease of body temperature by physical means is efficient only in combination with drug therapy and presumes the control of blood circulation
14036,aminophenazon is the most efficient drug to lower fever
14037,metamizol should be prefered in children at risk for convulsive disorders
14038,the combination of aminophenazon with phenothiazines can be recommended prothazine is the drug of first choice in suitable cases a caudal treatment of fever with antiphlogistic drugs as diclophenacsodium voltaren is indicated
14039,diclofenac sodium voltaren sodium o dichloroanilino phenyl acetate an effective well tolerated anti inflammatory agent is almost completely metabolized in humans and animals
14040,the present article describes an automated procedure involving liquid liquid extraction and subsequent hplc analysis to determine unchanged diclofenac in human plasma
14041,this procedure offers several advantages over current manual gc and hplc methods
14042,the transfer of the original manual procedure to an automated robotic system with custom made modules for solvent evaporation and hplc injection is described and a comparison between the manual and automated procedure is drawn
14043,the robotic method gave satisfactory accuracy and precision in the range of to micrograms ml with a quantitation limit of micrograms ml
14044,to study the antalgic and antiphlogistic functions and mechanism of ronggudingtong rgdt plaster traditional chinese medicine
14045,the painful models were established with hot plate test or acetic acid writhing and the inflammatory models were established with daubing dimethylbenzene on auricle or injecting formaldehyde in toe or synovial envelope to study the antalgic and antiphlogistic functions of rgdt plaster
14046,the total protein and leukotriene b ltb in inflammatory exudate were detected to investigate the antalgic and antiphlogistic mechanism of rgdt plaster
14047,the mice were randomly divided into different groups n on the basis of drug using the indexes of pain threshold swelling degree were observed
14048,sixty six mice were used to establish gasbag synovitis model and randomly divided into normal control group model control group positive control group voltaren gel mg d and low medium high dosage rgdt plaster treating groups mg d mg d mg d
14049,mg d mg d mg d rgdt plaster could upgrade the pain thresholds remit auricular and foot swelling p p and degrade total protein and ltb in inflammatory exudates p p
14050,rgdt plaster has some antalgic and antiphlogistic functions and one of the mechanisms is depressing synthesis of ltb
14051,a quantitative study of sodium diclofenac voltaren emulgel novartis phonophoresis was undertaken in humans
14052,fourteen healthy human volunteers were submitted to ultrasound irradiation on two cm areas on the dorsum group a followed by the application of the medication gel and the plasma diclofenac mass was measured at and h later by high performance liquid chromatography
14053,the same procedure was repeated one month later with the same volunteers but with the ultrasound equipment switched off for the control group group b
14054,the plasma diclofenac mass was significantly higher in group a than in group b at h microg ml as opposed to microg ml p and h microg ml as opposed to microg ml p but not at h microg ml as opposed to microg ml p
14055,the authors conclude that previously applied therapeutic ultrasound irradiation enhances the percutaneous penetration of the topical diclofenac gel although the mechanism remains unclear
14056,combination of nonnarcotic analgetics antiphlogistic drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid indomethacin voltaren and naproxen and immunostimulators such as prodigiozan levamisole and methyluracil were studied with respect to their effect on delayed type hypersensitivity dth to dinitrochlorobenzene dncb in noninbred albino rats of both sexes
14057,the drugs were administered after sensitization
14058,it was shown that prodigiozan did not change dth to dncb
14059,levamisole and methyluracil lowered dth to dncb
14060,the effect of levamisole was preserved in the presence of indomethacin and voltaren
14061,indomethacin and voltaren inhibited dth
14062,acetylsalicylic acid and naproxen did not change it
14063,prodigiozan methyluracil and levamisole did not change the character of the effect of the above antiphlogistic drugs on dth
14064,there is scarce information concerning the pharmacodynamic behavior of topical substances used in the physiotherapy setting
14065,the aim of the present study was to estimate the formation and emptying of the diclofenac df skin reservoir after passive semiocclusive and electrically assisted applications of df
14066,five different groups of healthy volunteers ntotal male and female participated in this study
14067,a df voltaren emulgel formulation mg was applied on the volar forearms on randomized defined circular skin areas of cm
14068,df was applied for minutes under three different conditions at the same time
14069,the presence of df in the skin results in a reduction of the methyl nicotinate mn response
14070,to estimate the bioavailability of df in the skin mn responses at different times following initial df application and hours were analyzed
14071,at hours after the initial df application a significant decrease in mn response was detected for the occluded and iontophoretic delivery
14072,passive application resulted in a decrease of the mn response from hours post df application
14073,the inhibition remained up to hours post df application for the iontophoretic delivery hours for the occluded application and hours for the passive delivery
14074,at and hours post df application none of the mn responses was inhibited
14075,the formation and emptying of a df skin reservoir was found to be dependent on the df application mode
14076,penetration enhanced delivery resulted in a faster emptying of the reservoir
14077,experimental carragenin paw edema in rats crams in rats induced by acetic acid and yeast fever in rats were used to study antiexudative analgetic and antipyretic action of present day non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs acetylsalicylic acid amidopyrin analgin phenylbutazone mephenamic acid voltaren ibuprofen indomethacin naproxen
14078,the correlation of individual types of anti inflammatory activity was characterized in each drug
14079,of the drugs studied the most pronounced anti inflammatory action was exhibited by voltaren indomethacin and naproxen were found to be less active
14080,it was shown that the methods for the appraisal of the drugs activity make it possible to study not only their anti inflammatory activity but also the effect on the inflammation mediators
14081,experiments on intact cats were made to study the effect of intravenous injection of voltaren mg kg and intraventricular injection of indomethacin mg kg ibuprophen mg kg and butadion mg kg on the coronary circulation and oxygen consumption by the myocardium
14082,indomethacin and butadion decreased the volumetric velocity of the coronary circulation and to a lesser degree oxygen consumption by the myocardium in all the experiments whereas voltaren in of experiments
14083,ibuprophen and voltaren in part of experiments led to an increase in the coronary circulation and to greater oxygen utilization by the myocardium
14084,effects of voltaren surgam and isamben on erythrocyte membrane were studied
14085,voltaren and suggam in dmm concentrations were to decrease but in mm concentrations to increased hypotonic erythrocyte lysis
14086,the role of erythrocyte membrane fluid is discussed with regard to this effect of the drugs since voltaren or surgam erythrocyte lysis even in isotonic medium at mm concentrations
14087,in contrast to voltaren and surgam samben as had no effect on erythrocyte lysis in hypotonic or isotonic medium
14088,in this connection the relationship between membrane lytic effect and ulcerogenic potency of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs is discussed
14089,in a double blind crossover trial conducted on a multicentre basis patients with classic or definite rheumatoid arthritis were treated for two weeks with diclofenac sodium voltaren mg t i d
14090,and indomethacin mg t i d
14091,both drugs led to a clear cut decrease in morning stiffness as well as to a significant improvement in pain at rest and on movement
14092,in these respects no significant difference between the two drugs was observed
14093,as regards their effect on status of rheumatoid condition however a trend towards a significant improvement was discernible in the investigator s opinion only in response to diclofenac sodium
14094,unwanted effects were mentioned by patients before the trial by during treatment with diclofenac sodium and by during treatment with indomethacin
14095,while the patients were receiving indomethacin five of them discontinued treatment on account of side effects headache in three cases headache and tiredness in one case and an allergic skin reaction in one case and one of them who complained of headache lowered the dosage treatment with diclofenac sodium was discontinued because of side effects by only one patient who had developed an allergic skin reaction
14096,the results are presented of the study of the effectiveness of non steroid anti inflammatory drugs apranax voltaren on the basis of observation of patients in a double blind trial after knee joint arthroscopic operations
14097,the administration of apranax or voltaren within the period of days after the operation decreased significantly the incidence of inflammatory reactions
14098,apranax was acting more rapidly and more effectively in elimination of clinical signs and symptoms of inflammation and the patients were not reporting any adverse effects
14099,in a double blind study diclofenac sodium voltaren administered for days in a dosage of mg t i d was compared with naproxen mg b i d
14100,for days in the treatment of patients with soft tissue rheumatism
14101,assessment of the efficacy of the two treatments was based upon changes recorded once a week in the following parameters pain at rest and on movement swelling local tenderness functional impairment limitation of movement and sleep disturbances
14102,the incidence of unwanted effects was also recorded and the effects themselves were classified according to the probability of their being causally related to the trial preparations
14103,both drugs appeared to be effective in relieving symptoms associated with soft tissue rheumatism
14104,in most indications the therapeutic efficacy of the two preparations was similar
14105,in patients suffering from diseases affecting the shoulder region however diclofenac sodium was significantly more effective
14106,unwanted effects rarely occurred with either drug
14107,the purpose of this double blind observer masked randomized crossover trial was to compare the tolerability and safety of a fixed dose ophthalmic solution of tobramycin plus diclofenac versus tobrex tobramycin sulfate ophth and voltaren diclofenac sodium
14108,control treatments included a saline solution and a control solution of tobramycin prepared by alcon cus
14109,ten healthy volunteers received three consecutive instillations of drop of a given ophthalmic solution at and h to the same eye after a washout period of h the next ophthalmic solution was tested according to a randomized sequence
14110,occurrence intensity and duration of ocular irritation and conjunctival hyperemia at baseline and after the three instillations were recorded
14111,slit lamp biomicroscopy examination measurement of intraocular pressure iop changes visual acuity and examination of the fundus of the eye were performed after each third instillation by an ophthalmologist
14112,side effect incidence and patient and investigator opinions were also recorded
14113,results showed that voltaren instillation induced statistically significant ocular irritation p the remaining ophthalmic solutions tested caused no ocular irritation physiological saline braun p tobrex p control tobramycin solution p and diclofenac plus tobramycin p
14114,none of the ophthalmic solutions tested caused severe conjunctival hyperemia
14115,analysis of the sum of conjunctival parameters of both eyes for all ophthalmic solutions studied showed no statistically significant differences p
14116,moderate superficial punctate keratitis was observed after instillation of voltaren and of diclofenac plus tobramycin subject each that spontaneously resolved within days
14117,slit lamp biomicroscopy visual acuity and iop values showed no statistically significant changes
14118,no systemic side effects related to the study treatments were recorded
14119,in conclusion the ophthalmic solution containing diclofenac plus tobramycin was well tolerated under the study conditions
14120,its tolerability was equivalent to that of braun physiological saline tobrex and a control tobramycin solution and was better than that of voltaren
14121,reverse micellar solutions of diclofenac sodium were encapsulated in soft gelatine capsules
14122,on contact with aqueous media they exhibited an application induced transformation ait into a semisolid system of liquid crystals sslc which slows down drug release
14123,the aim of the present paper was to study in vitro and in vivo drug release from these systems after rectal application
14124,in vitro drug release was determined in a self constructed dissolution apparatus to simulate rectal application
14125,for in vivo bioavailability studies rabbits were used as animal models
14126,in vitro release and in vivo bioavailability of the capsules was compared to voltaren suppositories
14127,the release profiles of the in vitro experiments show zero order kinetics
14128,the in vivo bioavailability studies show bioequivalence in terms of auc for both formulations capsules and voltaren suppositories
14129,the mean residence time parameter of sustained release of the capsules is three time longer in comparison to voltaren suppositories
14130,rectal administration of capsules provides an appropriate route for controlled release via ait sslc which could be clearly verified in rabbits
14131,ortopak tablets mg were investigated
14132,the pharmacokinetics of ortopak was studied in rheumatoid arthritis patients after a single oral dose of mg ortophenum and voltaren retard ciba geigy were used for comparison
14133,diclophenac sodium was measured in the patient s plasma by using high performance liquid chromatography
14134,ortopak was shown to be eliminated from the patient s body much slower than ortophenum
14135,the bioequivalence of ortopak versus ortophenum was
14136,the pharmacokinetic properties of ortopak were similar to those of voltaren retard which were close to those of diclophenac sodium in the blood plasma within the therapeutic range
14137,topical formulations of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids in particular diclofenac di have become popular for treating various acute and chronic painful inflammatory conditions
14138,to perform a literature review of the use of topical nsaids the pharmaceutical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a medicated plaster patch containing diclofenac epolamine di ep flector tissugel flector patch compared with other formulations of topical nsaids and evaluation of the clinical findings from studies with this novel di ep patch
14139,pharmacokinetic studies involved determination of di from di ep and separately epolamine ep and the epoxide metabolite n oxide ep in laboratory animals and humans the latter being the major metabolite in humans
14140,about of di is absorbed by the skin in humans and is excreted in the urine
14141,maximum plasma concentrations of ng ml di are reached at hours approximate steady state conditions the plasma elimination half time t being hours
14142,low systemic levels of di and ep are produced from di ep
14143,pronounced accumulation of di occurs in the muscle layers and in synovial fluids of arthritic patients no significant toxicity occurs from ep nor n oxide ep while that of oral di ep was similar to that from di and in acute musculoskeletal conditions sprains tendonitis and sports injuries and osteoarthritis di ep patches control pain and signs of joint or physical injury compared with placebo controls by days with almost complete pain relief at days
14144,di ep was shown to have equivalent therapeutic effect to another di diethylammonium gel formulation voltaren emulgel
14145,there were no reports of serious adverse events in the gastro intestinal gi tract kidneys or liver from di ep
14146,mild gi symptoms and skin reactions occur in and of patients respectively
14147,the patch delivery of di in di ep affords controlled delivery of the active drug in contrast to that from application of gels or ointments of nsaids
14148,the effect of dimephosphon on the development of the experimental inflammatory edema agar dextran and carrageenan induced edema of rat and mouse paws was compared with those of voltaren and dimedrol
14149,the anti inflammatory activity of dimephosphon occurring on account of the antiexudative component was established
14150,the antihistamine and antiserotonin activity of dimephosphon was shown on models of paw edema caused by subplantar administration of mediators and modulators of inflammation
14151,the drug exerts no influence on similar effects of bradykinin and prostaglandin e intensifies edema inducing action of prostaglandin f alpha
14152,the involvement of the anti inflammatory component in the therapeutic effect of dimephosphon is suggested
14153,to establish the corneal penetration of diclofenac in the presence of gentamicin in patients having cataract surgery
14154,kantonsspital augenklinik aarau and h pital jules gonin lausanne switzerland
14155,eligible patients having cataract surgery women men were treated with drops of diclofenac gentamicin voltamicin instilled at minute intervals
14156,paracentesis was performed or minutes after the last instillation and a sample of aqueous humor was collected for analysis of diclofenac by high performance liquid chromatography
14157,blood samples of some patients were obtained before surgery for analysis
14158,mean diclofenac levels sd in the aqueous humor and minutes after the last instillation were and ng ml nmol l respectively
14159,diclofenac remained below the limit of detection ng ml in all samples of blood serum
14160,in general local tolerance was good no side effects were reported
14161,comparison of the data with published results of topically instilled diclofenac suggests that the concentration of diclofenac in the aqueous humor achieved with instillations of the combination product is similar to that achieved with instillations of diclofenac voltaren ophtha alone
14162,drug levels of diclofenac in the aqueous humor well above ic for cyclo oxygenase were achieved with the regimen applied
14163,no inhibitory effect by the gentamicin or vehicle was observed
14164,comparison of these data with published results of voltaren ophtha implies a fold better penetration of diclofenac with the diclofenac gentamicin combination
14165,in a double blind between patient trial the efficacy and tolerability of two new non steroid anti inflammatory analgesics diclofenac sodium voltaren mg b i d
14166,and naproxen mg b i d were compared in hospitalised patients with rheumatoid arthritis
14167,both drugs had a clearly positive effect on the duration of morning stiffness bilateral grip strength pain at rest and pain on movement
14168,no statistically significant difference between the two drugs was found with respect to clinical efficacy
14169,three patients treated with diclofenac sodium reported unwanted effects as compared with seven patients receiving naproxen
14170,these unwated effects led to premature discontinuation of the treatment in one patient on naproxen
14171,thus although both drugs were well tolerated it appeared that diclofenac sodium caused somewhat fewer unwanted effects
14172,a double blind cross over trial compared the antiinflammatory and analgesic effects as well as tolerability of diclofenac sodium voltaren and ibuprofen
14173,twenty four outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis were included
14174,a single blind placebo period was inserted between the two active treatments
14175,the daily dose of diclofenac sodium was mg bid and that of ibuprofen mg tid
14176,the duration of each treatment period was days
14177,the efficacy was measured by the following criteria articular index lansbury morning stiffness fatigue pain measured on a visual analogue scale consumption of rescue analgesics status of the arthritic condition and patient preference
14178,no significant differences were found between diclofenac sodium and ibuprofen but regarding consumption of analgesic global evaluation rheumatic activity and activity index a slight trend towards a better effect of diclofenac sodium was found
14179,the study had an adequate sensitivity as it could distinguish placebo from the active treatments for all parameters evaluated
14180,no patient was withdrawn for unwanted effects
14181,none of the laboratory data showed abnormalities of clinical relevance
14182,the percutaneous absorption of diclofenac diethylammonium w w in a combination of emulsion cream and gel voltaren emulgel and of diclofenac sodium w w in a cream formulation voltaren cream was investigated in guinea pig rabbit and man
14183,the percutaneous absorption of diclofenac sodium in guinea pig was to of the dose when the cream formulation in doses of or mg was applied on cm of occluded skin and left in place for h the transdermal delivery of c labelled diclofenac yielded plateau plasma concentrations of radiotracer from h after application until removal of the residual cream
14184,subsequently the steady state drug depots in the skin and muscle tissue were depleted promptly
14185,during daily administration the steady state levels in the muscle tissue in proximity to the application site were about times higher than in distant muscle tissue
14186,by topical application on knee joints of rabbits diclofenac penetrated into the patellar ligament the adipose corpus and the synovial fluid
14187,in man the percutaneous absorption was of the dose when the emulgel formulation was spread by mg cm and left for h on non occluded skin
14188,the pattern of metabolites of diclofenac in human urine was the same after topical and oral administration
14189,in man upon daily topical administration of times g cream formulation mg cm the diclofenac steady state plasma levels were to nmol l
14190,abstract truncated at words
14191,to examine the effects of prolonged systemic administration of diclofenac sodium voltaren a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug on objective indices of exercise induced muscle damage in humans
14192,fifty four volunteers mean age yr range participated in this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial
14193,to achieve steady state tissue levels either placebo or diclofenac was orally administered two times a day for consecutive days
14194,a strenuous min stepping exercise program about which the subjects were unfamiliar was conducted on day creatine kinase ck activities were measured immediately before the exercise session and on days and vastus lateralis muscle samples were obtained immediately before exercise and on day for subsequent histological characterization of muscle inflammation
14195,the preexercise muscle samples revealed no difference in muscle damage between the two groups
14196,however the postexercise muscle samples showed that the diclofenac treated group demonstrated less muscle tissue damage than placebo treated subjects p
14197,the administration of diclofenac also resulted in a significant lowering of post pre exercise ck ratios on days p and p compared with the placebo group an indirect finding that supports the possibility of diclofenac reducing exercise induced muscle damage
14198,these findings demonstrate preadministration of diclofenac in accordance with tissue half life pharmacokinetics significantly reduces quantitative indices of exercise induced skeletal muscle damage in human muscle
14199,the electrochemical analysis of cytochrome catalytic activity has shown that vitamins c a and influence on electron transfer and fe fe reduction process of cytochrome
14200,these data allow to assume possibility of cross effects and interference of vitamins antioxidants with drugs metabolised by cytochrome at carrying out of complex therapy
14201,this class of vitamins shows antioxidant properties that lead to increase of the cathodic current corresponding to heme reduction of this functionally significant haemoprotein
14202,ascorbic acid of mm concentration stimulates cathodic peak an electrochemical signal of cytochrome
14203,at the presence of diclofenac voltaren a typical substrate of cytochrome the increase growth of a catalytic current testifying to an electrocatalysis and stimulating action of ascorbic acid is observed
14204,in the presence of vitamins a and also is registered dose dependent in a range of m increase in a catalytic current of cytochrome the maximum increase corresponds to for m of vitamin a and for m of vitamin e vitamin e in the presence of p s inhibitor itraconazole doesn t give essential increase in a reductive current unlike retinol vitamin a
14205,this effect can manifest substrate properties of tocopherol vitamin e
14206,the electrochemical approach for the analysis of catalytic activity of cytochrome and studies of influence of biologically active compounds on an electrocatalysis is the sensitive and effective sensor approach allowing to use low concentration of protein on an electrode till mol electrode to carry out the analysis without participation of protein redox partners and to reveal drug drug or drug vitamins interaction in pre clinical experiments
14207,monitoring the synovium is a central requirement in haemophilia
14208,in cases of acute synovitis a sufficiently high dosage of coagulation factor should be used immediately and pain control and anti inflammatory treatment are essential
14209,severe effusion should be aspirated and persistent inflammation should be treated with steroid injections
14210,in relation to physical therapy cryotherapy with co and cp current after bernhard should be used if appropriate in combination with ultrasound and phonophoresis with voltaren voltarol emulgel
14211,early functional treatment is essential following a short individually variable period of immobilization with the aim of restoring flexibility coordination and strength closed chain
14212,if the treatment is insufficient and chronic synovitis develops consideration must be given after month of early synovectomy by chemical radio active arthroscopic techniques or by arthrotomy
14213,the physical therapy following operations of this sort should be regarded as the same as for acute synovitis
14214,the rehabilitation of synovitis is independent of co infections
14215,a study was made of the action of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent glucamin on the processes of oxidation and phosphorylation op in isolated mitochondria of the liver
14216,it has been established that glucamin does not exhibit the properties of a separator in the explored concentrations m
14217,unlike the standard drug voltaren that separates op processes it slightly enhances interaction of liver mitochondria which oxidize nad dependent substrates
14218,the effect of voltaren is dose dependent being pronounced to a greater measure when succinate is applied as a substrate of mitochondria oxidation
14219,chitosan hydrogel beads containing diclofanac sodium were prepared using ionotropic gelation technique in which tripolyphosphate solution was used as a counterion
14220,chitosan molecular weight tripolyphosphate concentration and crosslinking time were found to have an effect on the percentage of the drug loading
14221,the loading efficiency of diclofenac sodium was very high more than
14222,a longer period of contact with the counterion ions decreased the efficiency of drug loading
14223,the beads produced all had good spherical geometry
14224,the beads showed a narrow size distribution in which of the beads prepared were in the range of mm
14225,comparison of release rate time plots of dissolution data of marketed product with the newly developed dosage form indicated the ability of the later to sustain more diclofenac sodium release
14226,the beads were evaluated for their bioavailability in six beagle dogs relative to the commercial enteric coated voltaren tablets
14227,the in vivo availability study reveled that the prepared beads filled in hard gelatin capsules had a bioavailability relative to that of the commercial voltaren tablets
14228,the beads showed comparable pharmacokinetic parameters to that of the commercial tablets
14229,the results suggested the possibility of producing a promising sustained drug delivery system for diclofenac sodium
14230,to explore the potential association between adverse corneal events and the use of topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids
14231,practice based reports
14232,a detailed case reporting form and request for medical records were sent to all practices reporting cases of corneal or conjunctival pathology in association with the use of topical nsaids to the american society of cataract and refractive surgery
14233,cases were classified as mild moderate or severe according to predetermined clinical criteria
14234,records of eyes patients were reviewed cases were mild moderate and severe
14235,an association with a specific topical nsaid was confirmed in cases
14236,most confirmed cases involved generic diclofenac falcon
14237,cases associated with brand diclofenac voltaren ciba vision and ketorolac acular allergan were more likely to have ocular comorbidity and to have received significantly higher total doses of nsaids
14238,neither off label use nor use of any specific agent was associated with severe compared to mild or moderate disease
14239,however patients with more severe adverse events were more likely to have a history of diabetes previous surgery in the affected eye and surgery other than cataract
14240,cases not occurring in the perioperative period had significantly worse outcomes had significantly more ocular comorbidities and received nearly times the dose of nsaids
14241,while topical nsaids as a class may be associated with severe adverse events such events appeared to require potentiation in the form of high total doses ocular comorbidities or both with acular and voltaren
14242,severe adverse events might have been more likely to occur at lower doses and in routine postoperative settings with generic diclofenac
14243,diclofenac sodium voltaren is a non steroid anti inflammatory agent of a new chemical structure which is animal experiments shows a high degree of anti inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic activity in various pharmacological models
14244,it inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo and this inhibitory effect at least partly explains the mechanism of action of the preparation
14245,in animal experiments diclofenac sodium is characterised by a broad therapeutic range
14246,also its gastrointestinal tolerability is better than that of other highly effective non steroid anti inflammatory agents
14247,two of the metabolites produced during the biotransformation of diclofenac sodium in man are also biologically active
14248,the activity of these two metabolites however is very much weaker than that of unchanged diclofenac sodium and is comparable to that of phenylbutazone
14249,the chlorinating activity of myeloperoxidase isolated from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils was inhibited by the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac voltaren
14250,the concentration of diclofenac needed for inhibition was microm a value comparable with ic values found for other drugs
14251,diclofenac did not react with hocl nor with ho but was oxidized in the presence of myeloperoxidase and ho to an orange coloured unstable product
14252,the rate of oxidation was proportional to the enzyme concentration and to the concentration of diclofenac
14253,but independent of the ho concentration
14254,presumably both compound i and compound ii two intermediates formed during the reaction cycle of myeloperoxidase with ho are able to oxidize diclofenac
14255,in these redox reactions the active short living compound i is reduced to compound ii thereby inhibiting the chlorinating activity of the enzyme
14256,analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry showed that in the presence of ho myeloperoxidase oxidizes diclofenac to dihydroxyazobenzene
14257,the in vitro effect of pirprofen rengasil an antiinflammatory agent on the surface ultrastructure and function of human platelets was examined and compared with that of acetylsalicylic acid aspirin asa and diclofenac sodium voltaren ds
14258,incubation with pirprofen induced formation of long needle shaped pseudopodia a phenomenon observed also after incubation of the cells with ds
14259,in contrast with asa and ds pirprofen induced a marked increase in platelet protein synthesizing capacity
14260,the drug decreased the platelet aggregation to a degree similar to that of asa and ds
14261,the release of platelet factors and and the level of beta thromboglobulin following incubation with the drug remained unaltered
14262,comparative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies on ortophen a new soviet antiinflammatory drug and voltaren ciba geigy switzerland were carried out in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
14263,pharmacokinetics of both drugs was studied in patients patients were given voltaren ortophen
14264,pharmacokinetic difference was statistically indistinguishable
14265,the comparison of the principal routine subjective and objective pharmacodynamic indices revealed no significant difference between ortophen and voltaren action
14266,the new drug was shown to possess a high analgetic and antiinflammatory activity
14267,a study was made of the analgesic action of combined morphine and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents naia voltaren ibuprophen and metindol
14268,it was established that injection of morphine prior to naia gives rise to a reduction in the analgesic effect whereas the combined use of the drugs or administration of naia following morphine entails the retention of the effect
14269,pretreatment with prostaglandin e produces opposite changes in the effect of the analgesics potentiation of analgesia upon morphine injection and its reduction after naia
14270,the data obtained present indirect evidence for the importance of prostaglandins in the antagonism of morphine and naia
14271,to observe the difference of the clinical effects of different needle retention times for acute lumbar sprain treated with float needle
14272,one hundred and twenty patients with acute lumbar sprain were randomly divided into a h group a h group a h group and a western medication group cases in each one
14273,in the three float needle groups plastic hose was detained near the pressure pain point on the lumbar after subcutaneous scattering with float needle
14274,the needle retention time was h h and h respectively
14275,in the western medication group mg voltaren tablet was adopted orally every day and the treatment was given for four days
14276,visual analogue scale vas and oswestry dysfunction index odi about low back pain were observed before and after treatment
14277,also the comprehensive effect was assessed after treatment
14278,after treatment the vas scores and the odi scores were improved obviously than those before treatment in all groups all p
14280,in the three float needle groups the vas scores and the odi scores were superior to those in the western medication group all p
14282,the differences in vas scores and odi scores among the three float needle groups were not statistically significant after treatment all p
14284,the effective rate in the h h and h group was
14287,respectively which were better than
14288,in the western medication group all p
14290,the effect of float needle for acute lumbar sprain is better than voltaren and there is no apparent difference in retention times
14291,diclofenac is a hydrophilic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid widely used in humans and animals
14292,there are limited published studies evaluating diclofenac s skin permeation following topical administration
14293,the aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the in vitro permeation of three different diclofenac containing formulations patch gel solution over hours
14294,these formulations were applied n per formulation to pig skin sandwiched between the two chambers in a static franz diffusion cell and aliquots from the receptor medium were sampled at pre defined time points
14295,an hplc method with uv detection was developed and validated with the aim of characterizing the transepidermal penetration in the in vitro system
14296,using this assay to determine the permeation parameters results at hours showed that the flector patch released the highest drug amount whereas a lower drug amount was delivered with the voltaren emulgel and the solution
14297,the commercial gel showed the highest flux microg cm h and the shortest lag time h
14298,based on these in vitro results using pig skin the transdermal patch resulted in a long lasting controlled release of diclofenac while the gel had the shortest lag time
14299,in the frog urinary bladder and skin block of cyclooxygenase with diclofenac voltaren resulted in an increase in the water permeability and a decrease in the potential difference and short circuit current
14300,addition of mumole of prostaglandine e decreased the osmotic water permeability to initial values and increased the transepithelial ion transport in the frog skin
14301,in the kidney of children with nocturnal enuresis there was an increase in the night diuresis and in excretion of osmotically active substances
14302,voltaren by reducing the endogenous autacoid production restored the kidney function and symptoms of enuresis disappeared
14303,the results obtained indicate an important role of the rate of the endogenous autacoid production in regulation of the water and ion transport in the osmoregulating organs studied
14304,approximately of patients undergoing cataract surgery have diabetes mellitus
14305,to evaluate the course of diabetic retinopathy after cataract surgery
14306,diabetic patients with no or mild to moderate preoperative diabetic retinopathy were included and classified into groups a d a the course of retinopathy b macular edema c the effect of voltaren ophtha eye drops and d systemic glycemic control
14307,group e included eyes with previous laser treatment for proliferative retinopathy
14308,clinical and angiographic retinal findings were scored before and after surgery
14309,progression was defined as an increase in the retinal score
14310,in groups a c d and e the non operated eye served as a control
14311,in group b the eyes of nondiabetic patients who had undergone cataract surgery served as a control
14312,retinopathy was stable in and progressed in p
14313,progression occurred during the first postoperative months in
14314,preoperative retinopathy was a risk factor for progression
14315,good visual acuity was achieved in and was correlated with preoperative retinopathy and postoperative deterioration
14316,macular edema was found in of eyes compared to of the controls p
14317,its development was correlated with preoperative retinal status
14318,twenty six eyes were treated with voltaren eye drops and with placebo
14319,progression of macular edema was seen less often in eyes treated with voltaren p
14320,deterioration of retinopathy was less common in cases when hbac was equal to or lower than mg
14321,close retinal follow up after cataract surgery is recommended especially in patients with preoperative diabetic retinopathy
14322,systemic control of diabetes and antiinflammatory eye drops may improve surgical results
14323,nausea vomiting and pain are common complications after strabismus surgery in children
14324,diclofenac a non steroid anti inflammatory drug is widely used to treat acute and chronic pain but there are few reports of its use given rectally in children undergoing strabismus surgery
14325,this open randomised study was designed to investigate the analgesic and anti emetic properties of rectally administered diclofenac compared with opioid morphine given i v
14326,in connection with strabismus surgery in children
14327,after obtaining approval from the local ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents asa class i ii children years of age were randomised to receive either rectally administered diclofenac voltaren mg kg or i v
14328,opioid morphine mg kg perioperatively
14329,the children were consecutively operated upon from may to january anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with propofol
14330,nitrous oxide was omitted
14331,the postoperative pain was assessed after arrival at the post anaesthesia care unit pacu by using the validated wong and baker scale faces pain rating scale
14332,postoperative nausea and vomiting ponv was assessed by measuring the frequency of vomiting and the degree of nausea
14333,in the diclofenac group the incidence of ponv during the first h was of which one child had severe vomiting
14334,the incidence of ponv was much higher p in the morphine group where of the children also had severe vomiting
14335,there were no difference in pain score between the two groups
14336,recovery time at the pacu was longer p and the postoperative analgesic requirement higher in the morphine group vs children
14337,no children needed overnight admission to the hospital
14338,diclofenac given rectally is an effective analgesic for this kind of surgery and gives less postoperative nausea than i v
14340,no serious adverse events were observed
14341,therapy with topical non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids relies on the ability of the active drug to penetrate the skin in sufficiently high amounts to exert a clinical effect which is linked to the specific galenic properties of the formulation
14342,this phase study characterizes the transdermal penetration and plasma exposure of different dose levels with galenic differences of a novel topical diclofenac formulation under development and indicates greater diclofenac penetration through the skin when compared with a commercially available formulation
14343,to evaluate the relative plasma and tissue availability of diclofenac after repeated topical administration of a novel diclofenac acid based delivery system under development dcfc
14344,this was a single centre open label three period crossover clinical trial of five discrete diclofenac formulations
14345,test preparations comprised two concentrations and of dcfc with and without menthol and eucalyptus oil total daily doses of mg and mg
14346,voltaren emulgel gel was the commercially available comparator total daily dose of mg
14347,topical application was performed onto the thigh of male healthy subjects for days
14348,applying a youden square design each drug was evaluated in subjects with each subject receiving three test preparations
14349,blood sampling and in vivo microdialysis in subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle tissues were performed for h after additional final doses on the morning of day
14350,all four dcfc formulations demonstrated a three to fivefold dose dependent increase in systemic diclofenac availability compared with voltaren emulgel and were approximately times more effective at facilitating diclofenac penetration through the skin taking different dose levels into account
14351,tissue concentrations were low and highly variable
14352,the dcfc formulation without sensory excipients reached the highest tissue concentrations
14353,auc h was times greater than for voltaren emulgel ci
14354,mild erythema at the application site was the most frequent adverse event associated with dcfc
14355,there were no local symptoms after treatment with the reference formulation
14356,dcfc formulations were safe and facilitated greater diclofenac penetration through the skin compared with the commercial comparator
14357,dcfc represents a promising alternative to oral and topical diclofenac treatments that warrants further development
14358,data in references referring to the relation between atypical or menstrual migraine and the use of oral contraception have been reviewed
14359,the authors own observations are discussed on this subject
14360,motilium and voltaren have been successfully used for controlling vascular headache developing as a side effect of contraceptive tablets
14361,in case of migraine associated with dysmenorrhoea and or premenstrual tension the management with triphasic hormone proved to be of therapeutic value
14362,the authors call attention to the concurrent high incidence of these latter symptoms and suggest the further analysis of this problem
14363,they collect evidence regarding that in the major part of cases atypical migraine is hormone dependent
14364,the anti inflammatory drug voltaren dichlorophenyl amino acetate is a relatively new substance in the systemic treatment of various pain inducing diseases related to the musculoskeletal elements
14365,in order to achieve effective results relatively high dosage applied p o p r
14367,should be used for prolonged periods
14368,the acupuncture methods presented the eastern minded western physician with a detailed list of trigger points which may have abrogated certain painful symptoms when appropriately used by acupuncture maneuvers alone
14369,in the present study the possibility of using the appropriate acupuncture point gb for the injection of voltaren in an attempt to relieve stable and prolonged tension headaches has been considered
14370,thus acceptable and combined eastern western treatment method if found successful may be evolved
14371,gb point has been selected because of its effective influence among others on tension headaches a highly common and most distressing syndrome poorly treated by conventional approaches in most clinics
14372,we present four cases of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with the cutaneous application of diclofenac voltaren emulgel
14373,the patients ages ranged from to yr three of the patients had used the medication three times daily for at least wk before the onset of bleeding
14374,in two cases the treatment was indicated for backache which retrospectively was attributable to a peptic ulcer
14375,in those two patients the hemorrhage was massive requiring blood transfusions
14376,because systemic absorption of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs from topical formulations has been documented caution should be exercised when prescribing these formulations to patients with a history of peptic ulcer
14377,this study addresses how to mask the undesirable taste of diclofenac sodium ds without interfering with an adequate rate of drug release
14378,ds microcapsules were successfully prepared using a system of ethylcellulose ec toluene petroleum ether
14379,the system was optimized by the construction of the phase diagram and determination of the amount of ec precipitated under different solvent non solvent ratios to determine the most appropriate conditions for preparing good microcapsules
14380,microcrystalline cellulose avicel and lactose were mixed with ds powder and converted into spherical cores by the wet agglomeration technique which facilitated coacervation and formation of thin and uniform microcapsule walls
14381,diethylphthalate dep and polyethyleneglycol peg in different concentrations or w w were used as plasticizers to impart better elasticity to the microcapsules
14382,the microcapsules were evaluated for ds released against crushed commercial ds enteric coated tablet voltaren
14383,the prepared microcapsules were taste evaluated by a taste panel of volunteers
14384,the results revealed that the optimum solvent non solvent ratio required for microcapsule formation was microcapsules containing peg or dep showed a faster rate of ds release compared to that obtained from other microcapsules and crushed commercial enteric coated tablets voltaren
14385,the palatability and the taste of ds were significantly improved by microencapsulation
14386,the extent of taste masking was influenced by the microcapsule core wall ratio the presence of additives within the core the type and concentration of plasticizer and initial core size
14387,diclofenac sodium enteric coated beads were prepared using the conventional pan coating technique
14388,eudragit l was used as a ph dependent release controlling polymer
14389,the beads were evaluated for their particle size distribution drug loading efficiency flowability in vitro release in n hcl ph and phosphate buffer ph and bioavailability in beagle dogs relative to the commercial enteric coated tablets voltaren
14390,the beads showed a narrow particle size distribution in which of the beads were in the range of mm
14391,the actual yield of the beads was and their drug loading was
14392,the beads released about of the drug during hr of dissolution in n hcl and the commercial tablets released no drug
14393,in phosphate buffer ph both formulations released their drug content in hr
14394,both formulations are therefore in compliance with the usp requirements for release from enteric coated dosage forms
14395,the in vivo availability study in six beagle dogs revealed that the formulated enteric coated beads filled in hard gelatin capsules had a bioavailability relative to that of the commercial voltaren tablets
14396,the tablets showed a significantly lower p area under curve for hr auc hr of micrograms hr ml compared to micrograms hr ml for the capsules
14397,the capsules showed a nonsignificantly p higher peak plasma concentration cmax of micrograms ml compared to micrograms ml for the tablets
14398,the time to reach peak tmax values were and hr for the capsules and tablets respectively
14399,the capsules showed less interdog variability with respect to cmax cv and auc cv compared to cv and respectively for the commercial tablets
14400,the anti inflammatory agent diclofenac sodium o dichlorophenyl amino phenylacetic acid sodium salt is extensively metabolized by rat dog baboon and man
14401,the main metabolites were isolated from the urine of all species and from the bile of rat and dog and identified by spectroscopy
14402,metabolism involves direct conjugation of the unchanged drug or oxidation of the aromatic rings usually followed by conjugation
14403,sites of oxidation are either position or of the dichlorophenyl ring or alternatively position of the phenyl ring attached to the acetic acid moiety
14404,in the urine of rat baboon and man conjugates of the hydroxylated metabolites predominate but the major metabolite in dog urine is the taurine conjugate of unchanged diclofenac
14405,in the bile of rat and dog the main metabolite is the ester glucuroniade of unchanged diclofenac
14406,a singel mg enteric coated tablet of diclofenac sodium voltaren was administered to two groups each consisting of eight female subjects
14407,the subjects in the one group were young adults all aged less than years while those in the other were all over the age of years
14408,the plasma concentration time profiles relative bio availability and urinary excretion pattern of the drug in the two groups were similar
14409,thus in the absence of interacting factors such as drugs and disease the ability to absorb metabolise and excrete diclofenac sodium does not appear to be influenced by age
14410,three therapeutic regimens using nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis were compared in an open long term cross over trials
14411,voltaren mg suppositories or naprosyn mg suppositories were introduced every evening at bed time and naprosyn tablets were administered twice in a day in the morning and at night
14412,each drug was administered for one month and every patient was treated with all three drugs in succession
14413,the individual sequence was determined by randomization
14414,the assessment included nine objective and subjective criteria and after the termination of the trial each patient named his preferred sequence of drugs
14415,all three drugs proved effective
14416,the results of our investigations showed that nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs in the form of suppositories were more effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
14417,they exerted a more beneficial effect on morning stiffness and on pain than tablets of the same drug
14418,the treatment was most effective as late as in the third month of the therapy regardless of the substance which was administered as the third drug
14419,this confirmed our experience of the advantage of alternate administration of various nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs
14420,a series of subjective and objective criteria as well as the preference expressed by the patients spoke in favour of voltaren suppositories which was obviously due to the fact that naprosyn was ineffective in about per cent of the patients
14421,a rapid method for the estimation of sodium o dichlorophenyl amino phenyl acetate diclofenac na voltaren used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in human blood plasma is described
14422,the substance is extracted from acidified plasma with dichloromethane and acetylated after evaporation of the organic solvent whereupon quantitation is performed by gas liquid chromatography on a ov column f i
14424,quantitative determinations of unchanged diclofenac and two of its major phenolic metabolites were made by reverse isotope dilution analysis on urine of rat dog rhesus monkey baboon and man and on bile of rat dog and man
14425,isotope dilution analysis was performed before and after various methods of enzymic and chemical hydrolysis
14426,the same samples were also analysed by two dimensional t l c
14427,and subsequent autoradiography to estimate the remaining phenolic metabolites
14428,in contrast to rat rhesus monkey baboon and man which excrete mainly hydroxylated metabolites the dog does not oxidize diclofenac
14429,dog urine contained a relatively stable taurine conjugate of diclofenac and in the bile an ester glucuronide was excreted which decomposed even in weakly alkaline soln
14430,the unstable ester glucuronide found in dog bile was also demonstrable in rat bile
14431,it presumably hydrolyses in the duodenum releasing diclofenac which undergoes enterohepatic circulation
14432,the blood concentration of the slow release formulation of diclofenac sodium voltaren has been determined in patients at various intervals over a period of days
14433,in parallel the influence of diclofenac on the kallikrein kinin system was investigated since important interactions between the prostaglandins and kallikrein are known
14434,the peak concentration of the slow release formulation was significantly decreased compared with data of the standard formulation from other studies and the peak was observed later
14435,the areas under the concentration curves were however similar
14436,no signs of drug cumulation were observed during the treatment
14437,the kallikrein concentration decreased after one week in plasma and after two weeks in urine
14438,the plasma concentration of kallikrein reaches control level again after two weeks
14439,its urine excretion was increased to control levels after the third week
14440,these changes in the kallikrein kinin system did not reach the level of significance
14441,it is concluded that diclofenac sodium has only a short term influence on the kallikrein kinin system
14442,the action on the reparative stage of inflammation of acetylsalicylic ascorbic and mephenamic acids amidopyrine analgin butadion ibuprophen indomethacin voltaren glycyrrhizic acid and its penta o nicotinate delagil methyluracil and prednisolone was evaluated from the rate of the healing of skin wounds in mice and rats formation of the granulation tissue on the integmentary glass implanted into the subcutaneous fat from the effect on the functional status of fibroblast chromatin and changes in phagocytosis
14443,prednisolone indomethacin voltaren delagil appeared to inhibit whereas amidopyrine acetylsalicylic acid butadion ibuprophen and methyluracil to stimulate the reparative stage of inflammation
14444,the anti inflammatory agents that stimulated reparative regeneration raised the functional activity of chromatin
14445,one hundred and two patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or osteo arthrosis were treated for prolonged periods with diclophenac sodium voltaren geigy to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the drug
14446,fifty seven patients completed a trial of months
14447,a total of showed an improvement in functional class and of the total had complete functional capacity by the end of the trial
14448,the drug was well tolerated
14449,the side effects heartburn abdominal cramps headache and dizziness were mild and in most cases did not require cessation of treatment
14450,in patients the coombs test became positive during the trial but this did not require cessation of therapy
14451,we report a case of corneal melting associated with topically applied preservative free diclofenac voltaren ofta after laser assisted subepithelial keratectomy
14452,keratolysis was detected on day further progression toward perforation was arrested by immediate suspension of diclofenac and prescription of topical dexamethasone with hour patching
14453,at the last follow up the visual acuity had improved from counting fingers to
14454,preservative free diclofenac instillation had never been associated with keratolysis
14455,topical steroids may be useful in treating corneal melting associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
14456,mg day sodic diclofenac was found particularly active in subjects with diathetic rheumatism and arthrosis
14457,excellent general and gastrointestinal tolerance was noted after prolonged administration and in aged subjects with cardiac damage
14458,a protracted therapeutic effect was obtained especially in cases of diathetic rheumatism
14459,the ability to ameliorate sulfur mustard hd induced oedema by treatment with anti inflammatory drugs was reported previously after screening four steroids and four non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids using the mouse ear vesicant model
14460,following the screening study one steroid and one nsaid adexone and voltaren were selected as the most effective and a mixture of the two was chosen for the present more extensive research
14461,the effect of the combined treatment on clinical biochemical and histopathological parameters following hd insult was studied
14462,mice ears were exposed to micro l of hd for min to produce a moderate skin injury
14463,oedema development peaked ca
14464,h following exposure as determined by weighing ear biopsies
14465,histological observations at that time exhibited damage to the epidermis and dermis
14466,an increase in prostaglandin e pge was measured in skin homogenates starting h following exposure and lasting at least up to h post exposure
14467,a topical treatment using the above anti inflammatory mixture significantly reduced inflammatory parameters when applied up to h following exposure
14468,these parameters included extent of oedema levels of pge area of clinical damage and extent of cytotoxic injury vesications and damaged epithelial cells
14469,thus a combination of a steroid and nsaid was found to be effective in reducing the intensity of hd skin injury and possibly shortening the time to full recovery
14470,the treatment however did not prevent completely the ensuing cytotoxic processes in the epithelial layer
14471,pes anserine bursitis strongly affects quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis
14472,treatment includes nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids physiotherapy and injections of corticosteroid with highly variable responses recovery can take days to months
14473,mesotherapy is a minimally invasive technique consisting of subcutaneous injections of bioactive substances
14474,the goal is to modulate the pharmacokinetics of the injected substance and prolong the effects at a local level
14475,to evaluate the effects of mesotherapy with diclofenac for anserine bursitis associated with knee osteoarthritis
14476,one hundred and seventeen patients with anserine bursitis associated with grade ii kellgren lawrence knee osteoarthritis assessed by clinical radiographic and ultrasonographic examination were evaluated and treated
14477,they were randomly divided into two groups a mesotherapy b control
14478,group a completed nine sessions of mesotherapy with sodium diclofenac mg ml akis ibsa lugano switzerland ml for each session three times per week
14479,group b received oral administrations of sodium diclofenac mg voltaren novartis parsippany nj once a day for weeks
14480,primary outcome measures were pain intensity assessed by visual analogue scale vas along with ability to perform activities of daily living ability to participate in sports level of pain symptoms and quality of life as assessed by the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score
14481,these measures were performed before and after the treatment period and at and days follow up
14482,in both groups pain level decreased significantly after the treatment period
14483,ultrasonography showed a reduction of the hypoechoic area related to anserine bursitis only in group a
14484,administration of conventional nsaids diclofenac by mesotherapy is effective in managing anserine bursitis in knee osteoarthritis in the short term and mid term
14485,these observations could be of interest for efforts to reduce the adverse effects of oral administration of anti inflammatory drugs
14486,photorefractive keratectomy prk requires a careful pharmacologic regimen during the postoperative period to reduce corneal haze and refractive myopic regression
14487,noncorticosteroidal anti inflammatory drugs limit postablative corneal inflammation without the complications that may occur during corticosteroid treatment
14488,twenty consecutive eyes of patients with attempted correction ranging from to d of myopia were studied
14489,during the postoperative period corticosteroid drops dexamethasone were instilled in the first eye of each patient and the second eye was treated with diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution voltaren
14490,follow up was months after surgery
14491,corneal haze and refraction were studied
14492,six of the eyes treated with noncorticosteroidal anti inflammatory drugs did not show any significant difference in corneal haze and refractive evolution compared to the contralateral eyes treated with corticosteroids
14493,two eyes showed less corneal haze and more refractive stability than the contralateral eyes
14494,in two eyes we observed similar corneal haze but more refractive regression than in the contralateral eyes
14495,eyes treated with topical diclofenac sodium had a similar postoperative course as those treated with corticosteroids but without the adverse effects of corticosteroids
14496,topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs are represented by diclofenac voltaren which has significant ocular penetration
14497,this permits reduction of the possibility of general and ocular complications that frequently occur with corticosteroids
14498,the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs vs corticosteroidal eyedrops after photorefractive keratectomy prk to reduce moderate and high myopia
14499,there is a great need to develop a method for making an accurate and reliable in vitro diagnosis of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to drugs
14500,we measured the amount of sulfidoleukotriene slt released from the peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions following the administration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids patients demonstrated reactions to voltaren patients to bufferin and patients to sedes g the stimulation index the ratio of the amounts of slt pg ml incubated with and without drugs was considerably higher in the patients than in the controls which consisted of nonallergic healthy subjects
14501,the sensitivity of the cast cellular antigen stimulation test was evaluated to range from to while the specificity was
14502,the cast may thus be useful as a novel in vitro test system in order to screen for possible hypersensitive reactions to nsaids with both reliability and safety
14503,two prospective randomized double masked studies were conducted evaluating the analgesic effect of topical eyedrops after radial keratotomy rk
14504,one study of consecutive initial rk procedures compared topical ketorolac acular with topical diclofenac voltaren and another study of consecutive initial rk procedures compared topical ketorolac with a control medication hypotears
14505,topical ketorolac was significantly more effective than the control but not significantly different from topical diclofenac
14506,the onset of analgesic effect of these topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs is longer than one hour
14507,the analgesic effect of oral acetaminophen significantly augments that of topical diclofenac drops for those experiencing any discomfort by six hours after surgery
14508,in experiments with dogs and rats it has been shown that early after high doses of irradiation the content of prostaglandins in the blood plasma increases whereas in the intestinal tissues it decreases
14509,the inhibitors of prostaglandins synthesis indomethacin and voltaren hinder the development of early digestive disturbances normalize the intestine absorptive and propulsive functions and make post irradiation hypokinesia less pronounced
14510,possible mechanisms of the prostaglandins involvement in the genesis of prodromal radiation syndrome are discussed
14511,nicolau syndrome also known as livedo like dermatitis or embolia cutis medicamentosa is a rare complication following the intramuscular or intra articular injection of various drugs
14512,in our case report we report the case of a year old turkish woman who developed nicolau syndrome after an intramuscular injection in her right gluteal region of single dose diclofenac sodium to treat a headache
14513,a culture taken from the ulcer showed growth of methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus on the th day
14514,the secondary staphylococcal infection was treated effectively with intravascular ampicillin sulbactam g day
14515,she was treated with surgical debridement sterile dressings and analgesics
14516,the ulcer healed completely within weeks with scarring
14517,although nicolau syndrome develops very rarely it is an important cause for morbidity
14518,it is an iatrogenic condition treated mostly by health care workers
14519,thus although it appears to be a very simple procedure for a health care worker care must be taken during intramuscular injections
14520,although diclofenac sodium is a widely used non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nicolau syndrome following intramuscular diclofenac sodium injection has rarely been reported in the published literature
14521,the application of a cold compress was considered to be an aggravating factor in our patient
14522,this case highlights the need for awareness about this condition and the need to exercise utmost care during the administration of any parenteral injections by health workers
14523,the discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase cox constitutive and cox inducible has prompted the development of new molecules with high cox selectivity
14524,these new nsaids belong to the coxib class and have theoretically a better digestive tolerability than classical nsaid have
14525,in belgium rofecoxib vioxx and celecoxib celebrex are commercialized
14526,rofecoxib is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis to mg d and celecoxib is indicated in osteoarthritis mg d and in rheumatoid arthritis to mg d
14527,several studies have demonstrated their efficacy similarly to classical nsaid as diclofenac voltaren naproxen naprosyne ibuprofen brufen and their superiority compared to placebo
14528,their safety profile for gastrointestinal events is proven in patients without ulcer history compared to classical nsaid
14529,however the concomitant use of aspirin decreases the benefit as demonstrated for celecoxib at mg d but not investigated for rofecoxib
14530,the selective inhibition of cox with no effect on cox favors cardiovascular events in patients at risk
14531,other side effects are similar to classical nsaid
14532,thus cox inhibitors nsaid are interesting molecules for their sparing gastrointestinal activity
14533,they must be used with caution in patients with ulcer history in the elderly and in patients requiring aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis
14534,we have evaluated objectively pain tolerance in transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy trus using local periprostatic per rectal anesthesia as compared to the conventional method
14535,from november to may patients underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy at department of urology clinical center university sarajevo
14536,patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomized into groups of patients each
14537,group received periprostatic local anesthesia with lidocaine group received voltaren supp placed in rectum an hour before biopsy while group received no local anesthesia
14538,pain scale responses were analyzed for each aspect of the biopsy procedure with a visual analog scale of none to maximal
14539,there was no difference between the groups in pain scores during digital rectal examination intrarectal injection and probe insertion
14540,the mean pain scores during needle insertion in group receiving periprostatic nerve block and in group receiving voltaren supp were and respectively
14541,in group no local anesthesia mean pain scores were which was found to be significantly different p
14542,however morbidity after the biopsy was not statistically different between all groups
14543,trus guided prostate biopsy is a traumatic and painful experience but the periprostatic blockage use is clearly associated with more tolerance and patient comfort during the exam
14544,it is an easy safe acceptable and reproducible technique and should be considered for all patients undergoing trus biopsy regardless of age or number of biopsies
14545,of patients with acute rheumatic fever manifested enlargement of the left ventricle
14546,of these patients had it combined with an increase in the stroke volume the syndrome of load with the left ventricular volume
14547,these alterations disappeared or lessened by the end of the treatment
14548,they did not correlate with lesions of the valvular apparatus and were likely to be consequent to the underlying inflammatory process
14549,in patients with the syndrome of load with the left ventricular volume myocardial contractility was as a rule increased or normal indicating that myocardial contractility remained at a satisfactory level at the initial disease period
14550,comparative studies of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal drugs indomethacin and voltaren have demonstrated that they exert a similar effect on the clinicofunctional signs of rheumatic carditis
14551,this report presents the results of two treatment cross over investigations on healthy male volunteers to assess the bioequivalence of two suppository products of diclofenac sodium
14552,the study was carried out under us food and drug administration guidelines
14553,the two products were voltaren mg suppository ciba giegy as a reference product and inflaban mg suppository the arab pharmaceutical manufacturing company ltd apm as a test product
14554,both products were administered rectally as a single dose mg separated by a one week wash out period
14555,following drug administration blood samples were collected over hr and serum harvested from the blood was analyzed for diclofenac sodium using a sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatographic assay
14556,the results of this investigation indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the two products in either the mean concentration time profiles or in the obtained pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the serum concentration time curve for hr auc h lag time between product administration and first appearance of the drug in serum t lag peak serum concentration c max and time to reach this peak serum concentration t max
14557,concerning the relative extent of absorption assessed by the auc ratio inflaban voltaren for hr the average value was found to be with a confidence limits c l
14558,of thus these findings clearly indicate that the two products are bioequivalent in terms of rate and extent of drug absorption
14559,individual pharmacokinetics after administration of enteric coated tablets are often highly variable and this has been ascribed to the interaction of the dosage form with the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract
14560,this research aimed to explore the influence of interactions between enteric coated tablets and physiological factors such as gastric and intestinal ph as well as gastric emptying on the release of drug from the dosage form and the subsequent plasma profile using diclofenac as a case example
14561,a physiologically based pharmacokinetic pbpk model for monolithic enteric coated dosage forms was designed and coupled with biorelevant dissolution results to predict pk profiles of diclofenac from voltaren tablets in both fasted and fed humans
14562,the paddle method was used to obtain the dissolution profiles of diclofenac in biorelevant media
14563,the noyes whitney model was employed to describe the dissolution kinetics
14564,the pbpk model was set up using stella software
14565,a single unit enteric coated tablet was assumed to be emptied from stomach only with the house keeping wave
14566,timing of the emptying was simulated using a random number generator to statistically estimate gastric emptying times after ingestion
14567,the lag times and the dissolution rate used as input parameters in the stella model were adjusted according to the pre exposure period
14568,the oral pk profiles were predicted for each virtual subject individually and then the mean profiles and standard deviations were calculated
14569,the dissolution profiles were highly affected by the period of pre exposure in fassgf
14570,a long period of pre exposure of the tablet prolonged the lag time and decreased the dissolution rate
14571,the results of the pharmacokinetic simulations showed that not only the mean profiles in the fasted state but also the variability could be predicted successfully using data generated for the individual virtual subjects
14572,the results emphasize the importance of accounting for the range of ph profiles and gastrointestinal transit in the target population when predicting plasma profiles of enteric coated dosage forms and point to problems in demonstrating bioequivalence for dosage forms of this type
14573,we describe a case of severe pulmonary hypertension and transient right sided hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a neonate caused by premature closure of ductus arteriosus after short term maternal use of diclofenac sodium voltaren
14574,in view of this associated complication diclofenac sodium should be avoided during pregnancy
14575,in addition maternal diclofenac sodium ingestion should be suspected if a newborn develops severe pulmonary hypertension and or right sided hypertrophic cardiomyoptathy with closed ductus arteriosus
14576,the purpose of this study was to develop a new method using beagle dogs in order to evaluate the colonic absorption properties of oral extended release er solid dosage forms
14577,the established method is not only noninvasive and inexpensive but full sized er dosage forms are also directly administered to the colons of conscious dogs through the anus with an endoscope and modified bioptome
14578,in the method it was possible to administer the er dosage forms into the ascending colon of dogs within s min
14579,the colonic absorption of voltaren xr diclofenac sodium glucophage xr metformin pacif morphine hydrochloride herbesser r diltiazem hydrochloride and plendil felodipine which are currently on the market were investigated by this method
14580,the relative bioavailabilities of these er dosage forms to oral drug solution were and respectively
14581,some of these results reflected the human colonic absorption profiles reported in the literature
14582,this newly developed method could provide researchers with an alternative way to predict the human colon absorption performance of oral er delivery systems
14583,in humans diclofenac sodium voltaren a potent anti inflammatory agent is metabolized to a large extent by hydroxylation and conjugation to glucuronides and sulfates
14584,this paper describes a procedure whereby unchanged diclofenac as well as all known hydroxylated metabolites hydroxy hydroxy hydroxy and dihydroxy diclofenac are determined quantitatively in the same biological sample
14585,the procedure is based on extractive alkylation and gas chromatography with capillary columns and electron capture detection
14586,the method has been applied to analyse urine samples of volunteers treated with single doses of diclofenac sodium
14587,the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nepafenac to prevent development of mitogen induced pan retinal edema following topical ocular application in the rabbit
14588,anesthetized dutch belted rabbits were injected intravitreally microg microl with the mitogen concanavalin a to induce posterior segment inflammation and thickening edema of the retina
14589,the heidelberg retina tomograph was used to generate edema maps using custom software
14590,blood retinal barrier breakdown was assessed by determining the protein concentration in vitreous humor whereas analysis of pge in vitreous humor was performed by radioimmunoassay
14591,inhibition of concanavalin a induced retinal edema was assessed h after initiation of topical treatment with nepafenac w v dexamethasone voltaren or acular
14592,concanavalin a elicited marked increases in vitreal protein and pge synthesis at h postinjection
14593,retinal thickness was also increased by concomitant with the inflammatory response
14594,topical application of nepafenac produced reduction in retinal edema which was correlated with inhibition of blood retinal barrier breakdown
14595,in a subsequent study nepafenac significantly inhibited blood retinal barrier breakdown concomitant with near total suppression of pge synthesis
14596,neither voltaren nor acular inhibited accumulation of these markers of inflammation in the vitreous when tested in parallel
14597,this study demonstrates that nepafenac exhibits superior pharmacodynamic properties in the posterior segment following topical ocular dosing suggesting a unique therapeutic potential for a variety of conditions associated with retinal edema
14598,before cataract surgery at our institution we traditionally dilated the pupils with drops proparacaine cyclopentolate phenylephrine flurbiprofen sodium ocufen and ofloxacin ocuflox at minute intervals given times
14599,this was work intensive for the nursing staff
14600,since september we have used a wick soaked in a dilating mixture containing cyclopentolate phenylephrine diclofenac sodium voltaren and ocuflox
14601,use of the wick has been beneficial and time saving to hospital staff
14602,osteoarthritis oa is a chronic degenerative joint disease that is debilitating for many individuals
14603,while oral nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids remain a common and effective treatment approach to managing oa concerns over cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events can potentially limit their use
14604,various formulations of topical nsaids have been shown to provide effective localized treatment with minimal adverse events
14605,a patient perception study was conducted to evaluate patient preference between topical diclofenac sodium gel and that of diclofenac sodium topical solution with the penetration enhancer dimethyl sulfoxide dmso
14606,twenty four healthy volunteers were randomized and asked to administer one dose of the topical products
14607,surveys were provided and assessed immediately after application minutes after application and after the application had dried to gauge subjects overall experience with the topical preparation
14608,overall each drug s application was well tolerated and no adverse events were reported
14609,results of the patient preference survey demonstrated that topical diclofenac solution with dmso had a number of characteristics that were rated significantly better than for diclofenac sodium gel
14610,mean subjective responses to topical diclofenac solution with dmso were also more favorable for most items in the questionnaire and more subjects preferred or highly preferred topical diclofenac solution with dmso over diclofenac sodium gel
14611,nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids produce potent analgesic antipyretic and anti inflammatory effects
14612,we studied postoperative pain in consecutive patients having photorefractive keratectomy prk by an excimer laser with different topical nsaid protocols
14613,treatment with topical homatropine hydrobromide either diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic or ketorolac tromethamine acular and a soft contact lens was most effective in achieving post prk analgesia
14614,we also studied post prk myopic regression in consecutive patients and found that flurbiprofen sodium ocufen when added to topical steroid protocols significantly reduced myopic regression for one year postoperatively more than steroids alone or steroids and diclofenac sodium
14615,diclofenac used with topical steroids had less of an additive effect on myopic regression than did flurbiprofen
14616,topical nsaids are useful adjuncts to prk therapy both to eliminate postoperative pain and to control post prk myopic regression
14617,benzofurocaine similarly to ortophen voltaren causes dose dependent suppression of acute inflammatory reactions induced in rats by carragheenin serotonin and histamine protects animals from absolutely lethal dose of cellulose sulphate
14618,when administered in a dose of x m benzofurocaine exerts no effect on the activity of prostaglandin synthetase
14619,the purpose of the present study was to prepare matrix extended release pellets of diclofenac potassium using low amount of release modifying agents and to compare its performance in vivo with coated pellets and matrix tablets
14620,coated pellets were prepared by extrusion spheronization followed by double layer coating using different polymers separately
14621,matrix pellets with different release rate in vitro were prepared by extrusion spheronization with different kinds of retarding materials
14622,bioavailability study of different coated pellets revealed that the drug concentration in plasma of beagle dogs was too low to be detected and implied that the drug was nearly not released from the preparations before reaching colon due to the appearance of lag time in the dissolution process
14623,the phenomenon indicated that slow release pellets of diclofenac potassium perhaps should not be developed as double membrane controlled type
14624,the auc of the immediate release pellets the two matrix pellets and the reference were and g h ml respectively
14625,the c max of the formulations mentioned above were and g ml respectively
14626,all the matrix formulations including the reference exhibited incomplete absorption due to the short small intestine transit time and termination of the drug release in the colon because of its limited solubility
14627,the matrix pellets were bioequivalent with the commercially available tablet voltaren although the drug release in vitro of the former was much faster while the bioavailability of the matrix pellets with similar in vitro drug release to the reference voltaren was much lower than the latter
14628,the results perhaps was caused by lacking of physical robustness in the waxy tablet formulation resulted in low wet strength and easily destroyed by the mechanical destructive forces and finally introduced faster drug release rate in vivo
14629,it is apparent that preparations with similar performance in vitro may differ a lot in vivo because of the differences in drug release rate in vivo owing to various wet strengths of excipients contained especially for sustained release products
14630,diclofenac sodium ds may affect the number of purkinje cells in the developing cerebellum since ds can easily be transported from the maternal to the fetal physiological system during the pregnancy
14631,in the present study the effects of prenatal exposure to ds on the number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of week old w old and week old w old female rats were investigated
14632,there were two main groups the drug treated group dtg and the control group cg
14633,beginning from the th day after mating for a period of days a daily dose of mg kg of ds voltaren mg ml ampul novartis mefar ila sanayi a s kartal istanbul turkey was intraperitoneally injected in the dtg of pregnant rats
14634,in contrast a daily dose of ml kg of isotonic saline was intraperitoneally administered to the cg of pregnant rats during the same period
14635,after spontaneous delivery female offspring were obtained and the main groups offspring were divided into two subgroups as a w old group and a w old group
14636,therefore there were four groups at the end of the experiment the w old dtg and the cg and the w old dtg and the cg
14637,at the end of w and w offspring were perfused their brains were dissected and the number of cells estimated via the optical fractionator technique
14638,our results showed that while the total number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of offspring of dt w old female rats was significantly higher than that of the cg there was no significant difference between the w old dtg and the control groups
14639,therefore it could be suggested that ds administration during the prenatal period increases the number of purkinje cells in the cerebellum of a developing female rat throughout postnatal w
14640,a radiotelemetric technique with the heidelberg capsule hc was used to improve the quality of data generated in a bioavailability study involving an enteric coated ec formulation
14641,further changes in plasma levels of the drug from other dosage forms were related to changes in ph environment as determined by the hc
14642,eight healthy male subjects received the following treatments min after a light breakfast according to a randomized four way crossover design a hc and mg of a diclofenac sodium aqueous buffered solution b hc and one mg voltaren ec tablet c hc and one mg voltaren slow release sr tablet and d hc alone
14643,each treatment was separated by a week washout period
14644,two additional subjects subsequently received treatment b only
14645,multiple peaks were observed in the drug plasma level time profiles for the buffered aqueous solution which in all cases occurred before gastric emptying of the hc
14646,the multiple peaks were not observed for the voltaren sr tablet but a variable absorption lag time occurred which coincided with the gastric residence time of the sr tablet
14647,for the ec tablet the variability of individual plasma level time profiles was drastically reduced when the time after dosing was adjusted to coincide with gastric emptying of the hc
14648,finally the lag time between gastric emptying of the ec tablet and the onset of drug absorption was consistently at hr for all subjects
14649,this lag time was longer than the in vitro disintegration or dissolution times measured under usp conditions
14650,to assess the relative bioavailability of diclofenac sodium hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin hp cd administered via the subcutaneous s c and intramuscular i m
14651,route versus voltaren i m
14652,and to evaluate the dose linearity and pharmacokinetics of the s c formulation at three dose levels
14653,safety and local tolerability were also assessed
14654,one single dose randomized three way crossover relative bioavailability study and one linearity single escalating dose randomized three way cross over pharmacokinetic study were conducted at two different clinical sites
14655,a total of healthy male and female subjects participated in both studies
14656,subjects received mg ml diclofenac sodium hp cd i m
14657,and s c and voltaren mg ml i m
14658,in study and or mg ml diclofenac sodium hp cd s c in study
14659,study demonstrated bioequivalence of the s c test formulation with voltaren i m
14660,with respect to cmax and auc
14661,bioequivalence of the test i m
14662,with voltaren i m
14663,was also demonstrated except the upper limit of the confidence interval ci for cmax which marginally exceeded the range
14664,study demonstrated that after s c administration of the test formulation both cmax and auc are linearly related to the tested diclofenac doses
14665,all tested doses were safe and locally well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported
14666,bioequivalence of diclofenac hp cd mg ml after s c and i m
14667,administration with voltaren i m
14668,was demonstrated except for the marginal deviation in cmax when comparing the i m
14669,test and voltaren
14670,linearity was also demonstrated for the three doses intended for marketing
14671,a rapid and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of benzaldehyde a toxic oxidation product of the widely used preservative and co solvent benzyl alcohol in injectable formulations of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs diclofenac vitamin b complex and voltaren injection solutions by using dispersive liquid liquid microextraction followed by gas chromatography
14672,this method involves the use of an appropriate mixture of extraction solvent l dichloroethane and disperser solvent ml acetonitrile for the formation of a cloudy solution in a ml aqueous sample containing benzaldehyde
14673,the linear range was g l and the limit of detection was g l for benzaldehyde
14674,significant improvement is demonstrated for transdermal delivery of steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaid including betamethasone valerate and dipropionate indomethacin diclofenac piroxicam and naproxen when formulated in a submicron emulsion sme vehicle rather than in standard creams
14675,smes comprise oil droplets with mean size of approximately nm micron dispersed in a continuous water phase
14676,hydrophobic drugs are incorporated into the oil phase of the sme resulting in improved penetration and increased efficacy of the incorporated antiinflammatory drug
14677,the performance of medicated topical sme was compared with that of regular topical cream formulations as measured by the carrageenan induced paw edema rat model
14678,indomethacin in sme topical vehicle was more active than in regular cream base diclofenac in sme proved to be more active than voltaren emulgel
14679,improvement of steroidal antiinflammatory drugs action in topical sme cream was even more pronounced that is up to fold
14680,antiinflammatory drugs in sme also demonstrate noticeable systemic activity but for regional edema treatment local delivery is advantageous
14681,the new sme delivery system was tested for primary irritation in humans in a h trial
14682,low irritancy and excellent human acceptance for sme placebo or diclofenac loaded sme cream make this novel transdermal topical dds attractive for further development
14683,the objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical dexamethasone sodium phosphate sterodex to diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic after combined phacotrabeculectomy with mitomycin c
14684,this prospective randomized double masked clinical trial includes patients with glaucoma and cataract who underwent a combined phacotrabeculectomy
14685,patients were randomly assigned to postoperative treatment with topical diclofenac sodium or topical dexamethasone phosphate
14686,follow up duration was months and all examinations were masked
14687,the main outcome measures were intraocular pressure iop number of glaucoma medications and bleb morphology
14688,baseline characteristics of the diclofenac n and dexamethasone n patients were similar
14689,phacotrabeculectomy with both postoperative treatments was effective in reducing iop lowering the number of glaucoma medications and improving visual acuity at all follow up points
14690,the average number of medications taken by the dexamethasone group was significantly greater than the diclofenac group at months and respectively p
14691,the mean bleb height of the diclofenac group was significantly higher than the dexamethasone group at weeks p and the mean bleb width was significantly wider at months p
14692,no significant group differences in iop were found at any of the follow up visits although there was a clinical trend toward lower iop values in the diclofenac group
14693,sixteen patients in the diclofenac group and patients in the dexamethasone group completed year of follow up
14694,in this preliminary study diclofenac sodium is at least as good as topical dexamethasone phosphate for glaucoma patients undergoing two site combined phacotrabeculectomy with mitomycin c
14695,two non steroidal antirheumatic drugs diclofenac voltaren and naproxen proxen were compared with respect to their analgesic effect and the observed improvement in joint mobility in two groups of patients each consisting of males with either cox arthrosis or gonarthrosis
14696,the duration of treatment was up to six months
14697,the therapeutic response was assessed by the mean scores of spontaneous and exercise induced pain the clinical state of joints and painfree time of walking
14698,both drugs led to a persistent improvement in the condition of most patients but the clinical impression would appear to point to a more marked analgesic effect of diclofenac
14699,the daily maintenance dosage from the fourth week of treatment onwards was mg diclofenac and mg naproxen
14700,both drugs were generally well tolerated
14701,occasionally gastrointestinal side effects were observed more frequently in the naproxen group
14702,laboratory controls were carried out periodically but no evidence of organ toxicity or hemotoxic effects was found
14703,the experiments carried out on the urinary bladder of the frog rana temporaria l have shown that the period of recovery of water impermeability after an increase of osmotic water permeability induced by arginine vasotocin desmopressin or camp depends on the degree of increase of the osmotic permeability but not on the nature of the substance stimulating the increase of osmotic water permeability
14704,the removal of the hormone in the absence of autacoids fails to recover the water impermeability
14705,after cessation of the vasotocin action the water permeability decrease is delayed if phospholipase a and cyclooxygenase are inhibited by qiunacrine and voltaren respectively
14706,an agonist of v receptors has no effect on dynamics of the recovery of water impermeability
14707,this recovery has been shown to depend on pge concentration in the serosal solution after the hormone removal
14708,the obtained results indicate that decrease of water permeability depends not only on removal of vasotocin or camp but also on involvement of autacoids
14709,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of formulation on the pharmacokinetics of diclofenac in two sustained release formulations formulation a and voltaren sr after oral delivery
14710,the dissolution of diclofenac from sustained release formulation was ph dependent
14711,while drug released from both formulations increased with increased ph the release kinetics of these two formulations was different
14712,the pharmacokinetic study was conducted in healthy subjects administered with multiple doses of mg of diclofenac in a crossover design
14713,there was a significant difference in area under the plasma concentration time curve auc and c max observed
14714,the formulation with a reduced diffusion exponent with increased kinetic constant results in increased absorption of diclofenac in vivo
14715,this study demonstrated the impact of release mechanism of the formulation on the absorption in vivo
14716,the authors describe the results obtained during retrospective examinations of subjects who suffered from acute rheumatic fever years before
14717,of these subjects were treated with prednisolone in the acute disease period with indomethacin and subjects with voltaren
14718,the examinations were mostly randomized subjects no differences in the anti inflammatory effect were discovered
14719,heart disease was found in persons
14720,of these were treated with prednisolone with indomethacin and with voltaren
14721,the disease relapses were recorded in of them the signs of valvulitis in the past were shown only by persons echocardiographically
14722,persons had mitral valve prolapse which had not been diagnosed on the first admission to the hospital with any clinical signs of hypermotility lacking
14723,in persons having no valve lesions disease prolapse an x ray examination revealed a slight increase of the heart size estimated as a manifestation of postmyocardial cardiosclerosis
14724,thus it has been shown that modern anti inflammatory therapy does not prevent the development of heart disease
14725,apparently its onset is related to specific proneness in some of the patients
14726,a six week double blind randomized parallel group multicentre study was conducted in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip to compare the efficacy tolerability and safety of flurbiprofen sr mg with diclofenac sodium sr mg between group comparisons based on change scores from baseline we detected no significant differences between the two drugs with respect to efficacy for the majority of outcome measures
14727,there was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of patients experiencing at least one adverse medical event or in terminations from treatment
14728,we conclude that flurbiprofen sr mg is similar in efficacy tolerability and safety to diclofenac sodium sr in this trial
14729,to show and characterize our practice in the initial management of children and adolescents with sickle cell disease scd presenting in acute painful crises and to identify if there is a delay in patients getting the initial analgesics compared with standard guidelines
14730,this retrospective cohort study was conducted at the emergency department ed of king abdulaziz hospital al ahsa kingdom of saudi arabia
14731,the study participants were patients who visited the ed with acute painful crises related to scd between july and july exclusion criteria included age younger than years and those older than years old
14732,a structured medical records review was used to abstract the data
14733,the data was then computed using the statistical package for social sciences spss chicago il usa for windows version
14734,there were patient visits made by patients
14735,the time to administration of initial analgesic drugs was minutes
14736,two hundred thirty seven visits were discharged from ed after an average length of stay of minutes
14737,the most common initial analgesics used were morphine sulphate voltaren and paracetamol
14738,the routes frequently used were intravenous oral and intramuscular
14739,there was a delay in the administration of the initial analgesic and approximately a fifth of patients received their analgesics via an unrecommended intramuscular route
14740,to assess the effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug nsaid eyedrops on the expression of matrix metalloproteinases in corneal tissue
14741,ocular microbiology and immunology laboratory refractive surgery research laboratory the wilmer eye institute johns hopkins university baltimore maryland usa
14742,seventy rats were divided into groups intact and debrided epithelium
14743,uniform central corneal epithelial defects were created in the right eye of the debrided corneal group
14744,each group was divided into subgroups each receiving of the following eyedrops or artificial tears the nsaids were diclofenac sodium falcon or voltaren and preservative free ketorolac acular pf
14745,the artificial tears were carboxymethylcellulose sodium refresh plus pf
14746,the eyedrops were administered times a day for week
14747,the rats were killed on days and the corneas were excised and processed for immunohistochemical staining western blot assay and zymography studies to determine the localization of the production of the following matrix metalloproteinases mmps mmp mmp mmp and mmp
14748,matrix metalloproteinase mmp and mmp were detected in rat corneas at hours in the debrided and intact epithelium groups treated with nsaid eyedrops
14749,the mmp and mmp expression levels were higher in intact corneas in the diclofenac sodium groups than in the ketorolac and artificial tears groups
14750,the expression was localized mostly in the epithelial cells and occasionally in keratocytes
14751,this study provides preliminary evidence that topical application of some nsaids can induce the early expression of mmp mmp and mmp in the cornea suggesting that mmps play a role in the corneal cytotoxicity of certain nsaids
14752,the experiments with dogs exposed to gy of accelerated electrons demonstrated a significant role of prostaglandins in the origin of early post radiation dyspepsia
14753,their significance for genesis of post radiation dyspeptic disturbance caused by exposure to superhigh doses becomes clear cut when a combination of an antiemetic and inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis is used
14754,a study of the effect of dexamethasone a blocker of arachidonic acid release and of voltaren an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from cyclic endoperoxide suggests that it would be appropriate to prevent radiation vomiting and diarrhea by inhibiting both of the above stages in prostaglandin biosynthesis
14755,the authors compare various present day pathogenetic methods used in the treatment of patients with disseminated neurodermatitis cases with the atopic form and ones with the nonatopic form
14756,clinical and laboratory studies have demonstrated the efficacy of adrenoblockers pyrroxan and butyroxan included in multiple modality therapy for patients with manifest disorders of the autonomic nervous system
14757,combinations of glycyrrham and voltaren and decimetric wave exposure of the adrenal area have been also effective as well as parmidine an antibradykinin drug in a daily dose of g in the most severe and stubborn cases corticosteroids may be administered the schemes of therapy should be sparing and physiological with the drugs given every other day this helping reduce the total dose of the drug
14758,nonsteroid anti inflammatory drugs naid are compared in patients with periodontitis
14759,the results confirmed clinical efficacy of modern naid in this patient population
14760,the best clinical results were achieved with voltaren
14761,local anti inflammatory efficacy of dressings with acetylsalicylic and orthophene ointments and pyroxiphene was virtually the same
14762,to test antiradical medicines effect the chemical production of singlet oxygen naclo ho was investigated
14763,the quantity singlet oxygen chemiluminescence was decreased in the presence of japanese catalin and chine baineiting antirheumatic voltaren and less strong finish catachrome and carnosine
14764,american quinax does not possess such an effect
14765,one of the possible starting mechanisms causing different diseases atherosclerosis cataract etc
14766,is destruction of biomembranes by active forms of oxygen
14767,in this study we investigated the bioavailability of iontophoretically delivered diclofenac with the methylnicotinate mn test
14768,the inhibition of an erythema provoked by mn is proportional to the bioavailability of diclofenac in the skin
14769,it was our aim to use this procedure in the determination of the contribution of respectively passive diffusion occlusion and electrically assisted delivery during an iontophoretic procedure as used in physiotherapy
14770,a total of six application sites were marked on the volar forearms of each volunteer n for the following treatment and or control modes a cathodal iontophoresis of mg cm voltaren emulgel diethylammonii diclofenac for min b passive diffusion under a contact sponge c passive diffusion without any covering d current alone e standard mn response and f blanco site
14771,tristimulus surface colorimetry and laser doppler flowmetry were used to measure respectively the skin color and the perfusion of the microcirculation
14772,bioavailability was assessed by quantification of an mn induced erythema under the different conditions
14773,a significant reduction of the mn induced erythema was observed with the chromameter and laser doppler measurements for the following treatment modalities electrically assisted delivery respectively and application under a contact sponge and and passive diffusion without any covering and
14774,a significant reduction was equally observed for the site treated with the current alone and
14775,there was no significant difference between the response after iontophoretic delivered diclofenac mode a and application of diclofenac under a contact sponge mode b
14776,the procedure used enabled us to evaluate the bioavailability of a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug in the skin
14777,under the conditions used we did not find an increased bioavailability after electrically assisted delivery of diclofenac compared with the passive percutaneous penetration under the contact sponge
14778,the study of the antiexudative activities of voltaren indomethacin and piroxicam in combination with glucosamine on the model of carrageenan inflammation showed that the combination makes it possible to decrease the effective doses of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs by times with the preservation of the pronounced antiexudative activity
14779,a diverse influence of aminosugar on the anti inflammatory effect of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs depending on the sequence and routes of administration is connected with their membrane mechanisms and metabolic features of amino sugar
14780,diclofenac sodium is one of the most commonly used non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs
14781,it may cause alteration in the nervous system during neuronal development
14782,however there is no investigation concerning its role in the cervical spinal cord
14783,pregnant rats were divided into two groups namely drug treated and control saline injected groups
14784,to obtain the offspring of the drug treated group a dose of mg kg daily diclofenac sodium voltaren mg ml ampoule novartis was injected into the pregnant rats beginning from the th day after mating to the th day of the pregnancy
14785,to obtain the control group of offspring serum physiological at a ml kg daily dose was injected into the pregnant control rats during the same period
14786,male offspring were obtained after delivery and each group was divided into two subgroups week old and week old
14787,the total neuron number in diclofenac sodium treated rats was significantly lower than in the control group animals
14788,the total volume of the cervical spinal cord segments c c was also estimated
14789,there was a significant difference between the volumes of the two groups especially in the week old subgroup
14790,this may suggest that development of neurons and volume of cervical spinal cord are affected in prenatal animals after administration of diclofenac sodium
14791,peripheral opioid receptor targeting has been well established as a novel target in clinical pain management for acute and chronic peripheral inflammatory pain
14792,the physiochemical properties of the peripheral mu opioid receptor agonist loperamide hcl limit the use of the free drug as an analgesic or anti inflammatory agent particularly for dermal delivery across intact skin
14793,our objective was to manufacture an effective topical formulation containing loperamide using liposomal delivery that would allow loperamide to produce analgesia and anti inflammatory effects by penetrating the epidermis to reach peripheral opioid receptors within the dermis of intact skin
14794,a randomized double blind controlled animal trial
14795,thirty five adult male wistar rats g were randomly divided into groups loperamide hcl encapsulated liposomal gel naloxone methiodide loperamide hcl encapsulated liposomal gel free loperamide gel empty liposomal gel and diclofenac gel voltaren
14796,diclofenac gel was used as a positive control as it is clinically used as a topical analgesic and anti inflammatory drug
14797,animals received an intraplantar injection of l complete freund s adjuvant cfa into the right hindpaw and experiments were performed days post cfa injection which corresponded to the peak inflammatory response
14798,all manufactured formulations were applied topically on both hind paws twice daily whereas voltaren gel was applied times a day in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions
14799,the dose administered was l which equated to mg of loperamide hcl for the loperamide hcl treatment groups low dose
14800,naloxone methiodide mg kg was administered via intraplantar injection minutes prior to application of loperamide hcl encapsulated liposomal gel to determine opioid receptor dependent activity
14801,an investigator blinded to the treatment administered assessed time course of the antinociceptive and anti inflammatory effects using a paw pressure analgesiometer and plethysmometer respectively
14802,application of loperamide hcl in a liposomal gel formulation exerted analgesic and anti inflammatory effects exclusively in peripheral painful inflamed tissue
14803,this formulation produced highly significant analgesic and anti inflammatory effects over the hour time course studied following topical administration in rats with cfa induced inflammation of the paw
14804,as expected the diclofenac gel group showed significant antinociception over the duration of the study however this effect was lower in comparison to the loperamide hcl liposomal gel formulation
14805,all other control groups showed no significant antinociceptive effects
14806,in addition all control groups diclofenac gel free loperamide gel and empty liposomal gel did not demonstrate a significant change in paw volume over hours
14807,in vivo studies were performed in the well established rodent model of acute inflammatory pain
14808,we are currently studying this approach in chronic pain models known to have clinical activation of the peripheral immune derived opioid response
14809,the study demonstrates that topically applied loperamide encapsulated within liposomal systems has improved therapeutic efficacy over conventional formulations for the local treatment of acute peripheral inflammatory pain conditions where the skin has remained intact
14810,once in the inflamed peripheral tissue loperamide provides analgesic and anti inflammatory effects in a similar manner to peripheral endogenous opioids
14811,this preparation optimises the retention of drug at the site where action is required
14812,efficacy of different nonsteroid anti inflammatory drugs voltaren diclofenac movalis meloxicam nimesil nimesulide and xefocam lornoxicam in stopping the pain syndrome and normalization of motor activity was assessed in patients with dorsalgia using the visual analogous scale and the modified waddel scale
14813,moreover we suggest a method for calculating a treatment efficacy coefficient
14814,the most effective drug in the treatment of back pain was xefocam lornoxicam
14815,nimesil nimesulide was somewhat less effective
14816,other drugs did not reveal any significant effect
14817,xefocam was well tolerated adverse effects were rare compared to other drugs used in the study
14818,in this study the effect of vehicle on in vitro diffusion of diclofenac sodium ds from new different formulations such as carbopol gel a sodium lauryl sulphate cream b and carbopol cream c was evaluated with franz diffusion cells using hydrophilic and hydrophobic synthetic membranes
14819,the commercial formulation voltaren emulgel was used as reference
14820,furthermore the in vivo efficacy of topical formulations was studied in the carrageenan induced edema and hyperalgesia whereas the antinociceptive effect was evaluated on thermal pain threshold in rat paw
14821,the flux of ds across hydrophilic membranes showed this rank order control approximately equal to c a approximately equal to b on the other hand the diffusion rate of ds across hydrophobic membranes resulted in the following order control b a approximately equal to c this suggested a lower interaction between the vehicles and these membranes
14822,the in vivo results indicated that the prepared formulations failed in the inflammatory tests to reduce the development of edema
14823,nevertheless treatment with b formulation inhibited the development of acute hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan and elicited a significant increase in paw withdrawal latencies whereas other formulations were ineffective
14824,the results obtained in this study suggest that sodium lauryl sulphate cream might be useful in local pain conditions and may be an effective alternative to the presently used systemic routes
14825,the effects of various i v
14826,doses of diclofenac sodium voltaren and mg kg were evaluated by measuring the vocalization threshold in response to paw pressure in normal and in freund s adjuvant induced arthritic rats
14827,an electrophysiological study performed in parallel in arthritic rats considered the effects of mg kg i v
14828,diclofenac on ventrobasal thalamic neuronal responses driven by mild stimulation of an inflamed joint
14829,in normal rats and mg kg i v
14830,diclofenac raised vocalization thresholds significantly maximum vocalization thresholds were respectively and of the preinjection control at min n in each group while no effect was observed with mg kg
14831,in arthritic rats i v
14832,doses of and mg kg diclofenac induced a clear analgesic effect maximum vocalization thresholds were respectively of the control at min n in each group whereas a dose of mg kg i v
14833,did not raise the threshold
14834,in arthritic rats the vb neuronal responses were depressed by about min after an injection of mg kg i v
14836,these results clearly establish that diclofenac produces a dose dependent analgesic effect which is more potent in arthritic than in normal rats
14837,the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a conventional nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac voltaren novartis barcelona spain and a specific cyclooxygenase cox inhibitor rofecoxib vioxx msd madrid spain on the inhibition of dental movement induced with a coil spring orthodontic apparatus in rats
14838,tooth movement was measured on the lateral cranial teleradiographs of male wistar rats in experimental groups g coil spring and rofecoxib injections of mg per kilogram of body weight similar orthodontic procedure and diclofenac injections of mg per kilogram of body weight the same orthodontic treatment and saline solution injections and and g coil appliance and the same pharmacological treatment as and respectively
14839,the difference in tooth movement measured in the control animals after days of or g of orthodontic force application was not statistically significant
14840,reduction in tooth movement in g traction groups reached statistically significant differences both rofecoxib or diclofenac were effective in inhibiting dental movement
14841,the comparison of the groups treated with g of force also reached statistical significance
14842,both rofecoxib and diclofenac significantly inhibited dental movement partially in the case of rofecoxib and totally in the case of diclofenac
14843,nevertheless no statistically significant difference was found between the effects of rofecoxib and diclofenac
14844,there is no substantial advantage in using selective cox inhibitors compared with nonspecific cox inhibitors to avoid interference with tooth movement during orthodontic treatment in rats
14845,to assess the efficacy tolerance and ocular tolerability of a fixed dose combination of diclofenac plus tobramycin ophthalmic solution compared with diclofenac voltaren and tobramycin tobrex in patients undergoing cataract extraction by either nuclear expression extracapsular or ultrasound assisted aspiration phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation
14846,eighty eight patients undergoing cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation participated in a randomized parallel observer masked trial in which the clinical usefulness of a fixed dose combination of diclofenac plus tobramycin ophthalmic solution two eyedrops every hours n was compared with voltaren and tobrex one drop of each every hours n in a day course
14847,efficacy was assessed from changes of the sum of anterior chamber cell count plus flare conjunctival hyperemia and edema and ciliary congestion by means of slit lamp biomicroscopy on days and tolerance and ocular tolerability were assessed by recording intraocular pressure iop side effects and the patient s and investigator s opinions
14848,anterior chamber cell count plus flare showed no differences in the two treatment groups at any evaluation point
14849,the study treatment was associated with a significantly higher score for conjunctival edema on day p conjuncitval hyperemia on day p and anterior chamber cell count on day p but these differences had no clinical relevance
14850,no side effects related to the study treatment were recorded
14851,efficacy tolerance and ocular tolerability of a fixed dose combination of diclofenac plus tobramycin ophthalmic solution were comparable to voltaren plus tobrex for the control of anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery with the advantage that both active principles are supplied in a single container
14852,we have documented in previous studies that local irradiation therapy for breast cancer caused severe lymphopenia with reduction of both t and non t lymphocytes
14853,non t cells were relatively more depressed but recovered within six months
14854,the recovery of t cells on the other hand remained incomplete years after irradiation
14855,several lymphocyte functions were also severely impaired
14856,an association was found between prognosis and postirradiation mitogen reactivity of lymphocytes from these patients
14857,mortality up to eight years after irradiation was significantly higher in patients with low postirradiation phytohemagglutinin and ppd reactivity
14858,the radiation induced decrease in mitogenic response seemed mainly to be caused by immunosuppressive monocytes which suggests that the underlying mechanism might be mediated by increased production of prostaglandins by monocytes
14859,for this reason we examined the effect of some cyclooxygenase products on different lymphocyte functions and found that prostaglandins a d and e inhibited phytohemagglutinin response in vitro
14860,natural killer cell activity was also reduced by prostaglandins d and e
14861,the next step was to examine various inhibitors of cyclooxygenase in respect to their capacity to revert irradiation induced suppression of in vitro mitogen response in lymphocytes from breast cancer patients
14862,it was demonstrated that diclofenac na voltaren meclofenamic acid indomethacin and lysin mono acetylsalicylate aspisol could enhance mitogen responses both before and after radiation therapy
14863,this effect was most pronounced at completion of irradiation
14864,on a molar basis diclofenac na was most effective followed by indomethacin meclofenamic acid and lysin monoacetylsalicylate
14865,the clinically beneficial effects of irradiation might be overshadowed by its effects on the immune system
14866,if true the value of treatment could be improved if radiation induced suppression of lymphocyte response which correlates inversely to survival is reduced
14867,since such an effect can be achieved in these patients with cyclooxygenase inhibitors in vitro it is possible that it can be achieved also in vivo
14868,corneal wound healing following excimer laser keratectomy is the major cause of regression of treatment results
14869,the amount of anterior stromal haze that develops may be influenced by topical medications
14870,over a period of months we followed new zealand white rabbit eyes that underwent excimer laser keratectomy with the visx nm arf laser at a fluence of mj cm for a depth of microns
14871,eyes were randomized to treatment with prednisolone acetate diclofenac sodium voltaren a combination of both and a control group
14872,drops were administered four times a day for week two times a day for weeks and the drops were then tapered
14873,all eyes were reepithelialized by to days
14874,the tandem scanning confocal microscope tscm was used to evaluate the corneal wound in vivo weekly for a month and monthly for months
14875,during the early postoperative period the tscm revealed significant anterior stromal keratocyte activation with cell elongation and the spindle shaped appearance of fibroblasts in all groups
14876,collagenous stromal scarring was evident initially then slowly decreased in all treatment groups
14877,this study shows that tscm is clinically useful for successive in vivo examinations of corneal wounds after excimer laser keratectomy and for comparing the effects of various topical medications
14878,to compare the anti inflammatory efficacy and subjective tolerability of preservative free and preserved diclofenac and preserved ketorolac eye drops for prophylaxis and management of inflammation after cataract surgery
14879,prospective randomized investigator masked parallel group comparative clinical trial
14880,one hundred two patients who underwent small incision phacoemulsification cataract surgery in an institutional setting were assigned randomly to receive preservative free diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha sdu novartis pharma preserved diclofenac sodium voltaren ophtha novartis pharma or preserved ketorolac tromethamine acular pharm allergan eyedrops times daily for weeks after surgery
14881,during the month follow up anterior chamber flare and mean foveal thickness were evaluated for objective comparison of the anti inflammatory effect
14882,ocular tolerability was assessed by observer based grading of conjunctival hyperemia and ocular discomfort as well as obtaining subjective ratings of ocular tolerability on a visual analog scale
14883,distance and near visual acuity and intraocular pressure served as safety measures
14884,all formulations demonstrated equal anti inflammatory efficacy as measured by reduction of anterior chamber flare after surgery and prevention of postoperative macular edema
14885,patients treated with preservative free diclofenac eyedrops reported significantly better subjective tolerability values p were classified as having less ocular discomfort p and experienced earlier reduction of postoperative conjunctival hyperemia p
14886,anti inflammatory efficacy was comparable for all agents
14887,however preservative free diclofenac eyedrops exhibited a significantly better postoperative subjective and objective tolerability when compared with preserved eyedrops containing ketorolac or diclofenac
14888,in a monocentric randomized placebo controlled double blind study we investigated the efficacy of two doses of diclofenac cholestyramine for the prevention of heterotopic ossification ho
14889,the study comprised patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty tha
14890,with mg cholestyramine bound diclofenac x capsule voltaren resinate daily during a postoperative period of days of patients showed slight ho brooker grade and no patient had more severe ossifications grades
14891,in the group receiving mg daily x capsule of patients showed grade ho and grade ho
14892,no patient had grades ho
14893,no differences in clinical results were seen between the two groups months after tha
14894,since the rate of adverse gastrointestinal events was lower versus p in the group receiving the lower dose we recommend it
14895,the effect of diclofenac voltaren was studied on pge and pgfalpha induced contractions of pregnant human myometrium in vitro
14896,tests to establish experimental conditions revealed that pge and pgfalpha affect the myometrium differently from i and iind trimenon uteri
14897,pgfalpha always induced contractions in corpus uteri as well as cervix strips
14898,pge relaxed myometrium strips obtained from superficial muscle layers and from cervix tissue and caused contractions in the myometrium from the central parts of the corpus uteri
14899,diclofenac voltaren at concentrations of to m inhibited pge and pgfalpha induced contractions
14900,the inhibition was demonstrated by planimetric evaluation of the contractions curves
14901,contraction activity of i and iind trimenon myometrium strips was reduced by diclofenac but not completely inhibited
14902,from uteri at term three contraction curves showed complete cessation of pge and pgfalpha induced contractions by diclofenac m
14903,the dose dependent reduction of myometrial contractions induced by exogen prostaglandins indicates that diclofenac possesses a direct effect on pge and pgfalpha induced contractile activity of the uterus
14904,to compare the corneal analgesic efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids nepafenac diclofenac and ketorolac and to evaluate the possibility that their inhibitory effects on corneal polymodal nociceptor fiber activity are partly mediated by a decrease in sodium currents
14905,corneal sensory afferent units were recorded in the anesthetized cat
14906,the response of thin myelinated polymodal nociceptor fibers to mechanical and acidic stimulation co was recorded before and at various times after topical application of the vehicle or of nepafenac nevanac alcon laboratories ltd fort worth tx diclofenac voltaren novartis basel switzerland and ketorolac acular ls allergan irvine ca
14907,voltage clamp recordings were performed in cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons
14908,nepafenac diclofenac and ketorolac reduced the mean frequency of the impulse response evoked by repeated co stimuli in polymodal nociceptor fibers
14909,the progressive increase in ongoing activity observed in vehicle treated eyes after repeated acidic stimulation was also prevented
14910,nepafenac exhibited a more rapid and a slightly more pronounced effect on spontaneous and co evoked activity than did diclofenac and ketorolac and did not affect the responsiveness of corneal mechanonociceptor or cold receptor fibers
14911,in cultured mice trigeminal ganglion neurons diclofenac significantly suppressed sodium currents whereas nepafenac or its metabolite amfenac exhibited only minimal inhibitory effects
14912,the inhibition of polymodal nociceptor activity by nepafenac a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase is most likely due to its greater lipophilicity compared with diclofenac and ketorolac leading to a rapid saturation of the corneal epithelium where nociceptor terminals are located
14913,in contrast to diclofenac nepafenac does not exhibit local anesthetic effects
14914,from april till october patients were treated with the new generation of direx lithotriptors the trigen compact
14915,the treatment was given in one day clinic
14916,the preparation is made of an intravenous hydratation dipidolor intra muscular voltaren intra rectal and emla on the skin in the area of the shocks
14917,only patients are estimated at three months
14918,the first results are encouraging with globally of good results stone free or residual fragments inferior to mm and of failure
14919,the best results are obtained with the ureteral stones
14920,the results of the treatments of caliceal and pyelo lithiasis are a little bit less good with respectively and of good results
14921,these data should become better when all the patients will be estimated at months
14922,this study compared the pharmacokinetic profile and systemic and local absorption of diclofenac following dermal patch application and oral administration in yorkshire landrace pigs
14923,twelve anesthetized female yorkshire landrace pigs were randomized to receive either the dermal patch flector patch cm alpharma pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of pfizer inc new york ny or mg oral diclofenac voltaren novartis east hanover nj
14924,tissue skin area of cm and underlying muscles approximately cm in depth and blood ml samples were collected at timed intervals up to hours after initial patch application or oral administration
14925,the concentrations of diclofenac in plasma skin and muscle samples were analyzed using validated ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric methods
14926,peak systemic exposure of diclofenac was very low by dermal application compared with oral administration maximum concentration c max values of vs ng ml respectively
14927,absorption of diclofenac into underlying muscles beneath the dermal patch was sustained and followed apparently zero order kinetics with the skin serving as a depot with elevated concentrations of diclofenac
14928,concentrations of diclofenac in muscles beneath the patch application site were similar to corresponding tissues after oral administration c max values of and ng ml respectively
14929,in contrast to the wide tissue distribution of diclofenac after oral administration dermal patch application resulted in high concentrations of diclofenac only on the treated skin and immediate tissue underneath the patch
14930,low concentrations of diclofenac were observed in the skin and muscles collected from untreated areas contralateral to the site of dermal patch application
14931,dermal patch application resulted in low systemic absorption and high tissue penetration of diclofenac compared with oral administration
14932,in usual stomatologic surgery after the intervention the antibiotic cover is preserved but the classical anti inflammatory cover is replaced by a unique session of multi micro injections of injectable voltaren around the sutures into the mucous membrane
14933,the results are similar on oedema better on pain and this obtained with about ten times less nhai so much the better for side effects
14934,this study explored the application of chitosan alginate ca and chitosan pectin cp complex films as drug release regulator for the preparation of multiunit controlled release diclofenac sodium capsules
14935,pellets containing drug and microcrystalline cellulose in a ratio of were prepared in a fluidized rotary granulator
14936,the pellets were coated with ca cp sodium alginate pectin and chitosan solutions
14937,the pellets equivalent to mg drug were filled into capsules
14938,after h of dissolution test in acidic medium the amount of the drug released from any preparation was negligible
14939,the pellets were further subject to ph phosphate buffer more than drug release at h was observed with the uncoated pellets and those coated with sodium alginate pectin or chitosan
14940,both ca and cp coated pellets exhibited drug release profiles similar to that of voltaren sr
14941,it was found that approximately and of the drug were released at and h respectively
14942,both differential thermal analysis dta and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses revealed complex formation between chitosan and these anionic polymers
14943,it could be concluded that ca and cp complex film could be easily applied to diclofenac sodium pellets to control the release of the drug
14944,sulfur mustard hd a very potent alkylating agent and lipopolysacchride lps are both well characterized inflammatory factors
14945,we have found that concomitant exposure of murine macrophage cells raw to lps and hd induced protection against hd induced cytotoxicity
14946,both hd and lps induce release of inflammatory markers in raw cells
14947,however there are marked differences in the repertoire of inflammatory factors released by the two toxins while exposure to hd induced a dose dependant death of these cells no significant change in survival rate was observed following lps ng ml exposure
14948,additionally lps elicited a robust nitric oxide no and tnf alpha secretion whereas hd was practically ineffective
14949,both toxins increased pge secretion in a concentration dependent manner
14950,treatment of hd exposed raw cells with anti inflammatory drugs such as dexamethazone mum voltaren diclofenac mum or doxycycline mum decreased the release of cytokines but had no effect on cell viability
14951,simultaneous application of lps ng ml and hd mum resulted in an amelioration of hd cytotoxicity
14952,adding the no generator s nitrosoglutathione gsno or inhibiting no production using l n g monomethyl arginine had no effect on cell viability
14953,moreover addition of pge ng ml failed to induce any changes in cell viability under basal or hd induced toxicity
14954,in contrast tnf alpha ng ml provided remarkable protection against hd induced cell death
14955,these findings strongly suggest that lps exerts its protective action against hd toxicity through the generation of tnf alpha and may provide better understanding of the mechanism of cytoprotection
14956,the respiratory burst of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils pmn induced by particle or soluble stimuli was measured in the presence of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium voltaren
14957,diclofenac micrograms ml inhibited the oxygen consumption of pmn stimulated by x m of n formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine fmlp
14958,the inhibition was linearly correlated to diclofenac concentration
14959,by contrast diclofenac did not affect the rate of heat killed klebsiella pneumoniae ingestion of pmn or the pmn o uptake induced by microgram ml serum opsonized zymosan or microgram ml phorbol myristate acetate pma
14960,the pmn production of superoxide anion induced by various fmlp concentrations and m was also decreased by diclofenac
14961,however this inhibition declined when the formylated peptide concentration was raised suggesting that diclofenac could alter fmlp binding to the pmn membrane
14962,binding experiments of tritiated fmlp to intact pmn performed at degrees and degrees showed high and low affinity fmlp sites with dissociation constant kd values of approximately x m and m respectively
14963,diclofenac did not significantly alter the low affinity component but induced modifications of the high affinity component which were different at degrees and degrees
14964,at degrees only the dissociation constant value was enhanced by diclofenac competitive inhibition whereas at degrees both binding parameters i e
14965,dissociation constant and number of available binding sites were modified mixed inhibition
14966,diclofenac was also shown to bind to pmn with a low affinity
14967,this binding was not diminished at degrees by various concentrations of fmlp which even increased the number of diclofenac binding sites on pmn at degrees
14968,these data suggest that diclofenac binding to pmn may decrease fmlp induced pmn respiratory burst by interfering with the peptide recognition by specific fmlp receptors
14969,enhanced systemic absorption in vivo and percutaneous penetration in vitro was demonstrated after transdermal administration of diclofenac sodium formulated in u type microemulsion
14970,diclofenac sodium was solubilized in a typical four component system consisting of an oil polyoxyethylene eo oleyl alcohol brij v as the surfactant and hexanol along water dilution line w wt surfactant and wt oil phase before water titration
14971,viscosity and small angle x ray scattering measurements have evidenced bicontinuous structures within water fractions of and along the dilution line
14972,self diffusion nmr studies showed that drug molecules accumulated in the interfacial film and to some extent dissolved in the oil
14973,relative to a commercial macro emulsion cream voltaren emulgel microemulsions containing paraffin oil or isopropyl myristate increased the in vivo transdermal penetration rate of diclofenac by two order of magnitude whereas the rat plasma levels were increased by one order of magnitude
14974,the in vitro data obtained from excised rat skin were comparable to the in vivo results but suffered from discrepancies from the ideal in vivo in vitro correlation which might be explained by optimal in vitro conditions of perfusion and hydration
14975,it has also been found that when jojoba oil is formulated as the oil phase in the microemulsion the penetration rate of the drug decreases significantly
14976,based on the three dimensional structure of jojoba oil the wax is presumed to prevent the drug from being freely diffused into the skin while migrating from the interfacial film into the continuous oil phase
14977,the objective of this study was to evaluate the transdermal delivery potential of diclofenac containing microemulsion system in vivo and in vitro
14978,it was found that the transdermal administration of the microemulsion to rats resulted in fold higher drug plasma levels than those obtained after application of voltaren emulgel
14979,after s c administration mg kg the plasma levels of diclofenac reached a peak of microg ml at t h and decreased rapidly to microg ml at t h while transdermal administration of the drug in microemulsion maintained constant levels of microg ml for at least h the transdermal fluxes of diclofenac were measured in vitro using skin excised from different animal species
14980,in three rodent species penetration fluxes of furry mouse hairless mouse rat and microg cm h hairless guinea pig were obtained following the application of the microemulsion
14981,these fluxes were significantly higher than those obtained by application of the drug in aqueous solution
14982,in contrast to these results a flip flop phenomenon was observed when frozen porcine skin but not fresh skin was significantly more permeable to diclofenac in water than to the drug in microemulsion
14983,in fact the drug penetration from the microemulsion was not affected by the skin storage conditions but it was increased when an aqueous solution was applied
14984,however this unusual phenomenon observed in non freshly used porcine skin places a question mark on its relevancy for in vitro penetration studies involving aqueous vehicle systems
14985,recent evidence suggests that enhanced cell apoptosis is responsible for germ cell loss following testicular ischemia reperfusion ir injury
14986,a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium voltaren is a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor which is widely used in many testicular disorders
14987,the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of diclofenac dic on germ cell apoptosis in the ischemic and contralateral testes following testicular ir in a rat
14988,forty rats were divided randomly into four experimental groups of ten rats each group a sham sham operated animals group b sham dic sham operated rats that were treated with dic given subcutaneously at a dose of mg kg once daily and h following operation group c ir underwent min of unilateral testicular ir group d ir dic rats underwent min of unilateral testicular ir and were treated with dic similarly to group b ninety six hours following operation the rats were sacrificed and testes were harvested
14989,johnsen s criteria and the number of germinal cell layers were used to categorize the spermatogenesis
14990,tunel assay was used to determine germ cell apoptosis in both the ischemic and contralateral testes
14991,statistical analysis was performed using the non parametric kruskal wallis anova test with p less than considered statistically significant
14992,testicular ischemia in rats led to histological damage in the ipsilateral testis
14993,in the contralateral testis minimal damage was observed
14994,germ cell apoptosis in both the ischemic and the contralateral testes increased significantly after ir
14995,treatment with dic did not change histologic parameters of spermatogenesis in both the ischemic and contralateral testes but decreased germ cell apoptosis in both testes following testicular ir
14996,we conclude that testicular ischemia causes an increase in germ cell apoptosis in the contralateral testis
14997,diclofenac may be beneficial for spermatogenesis following testicular ir by decreasing germ cell apoptosis
14998,this is a case report of corneal hydrops associated with keratoconus with a review of current literature pertaining to diagnosis histopathology and treatment options
14999,a year old african american male presented to the university eye institute with acute unilateral pain redness and visual impairment
15000,his symptoms clinical presentation and past diagnosis of keratoconus confirmed his condition to be acute corneal hydrops ch
15001,the condition was closely followed utilizing topical treatment including hyper osmotic muro and non steroidal anti inflammatory agents acular and voltaren
15002,after months the patient s condition resolved but subsequent corneal scarring resulted
15003,corneal ectasia in patients with keratoconus may progress into acute rupture of the posterior limiting lamina pll and the endothelium resulting in ch which may manifest as an area of edematous and opacified cornea lasting up to months in duration
15004,acute complications such as ch seldom occur
15005,histopathology and confocal microscopy can be used to help visualize and understand ch on a cellular level
15006,after regeneration of the corneal structures central scarring may limit visual acuity and necessitate a corneal transplant
15007,a new antirheumatic non steroid drug sodium diclofenac voltaren geigy has been experimented in patients aged between and hospitalized at the iind medical division of enna hospital
15008,the patients were divided into three groups suffering from rheumatoid arthritis scapulohumeral periarthritis uratic arthritis and rheumatic carditis in active phase
15009,in almost all treated cases the drug proved to have good therapeutic effectiveness demonstrated by complete remission or attenuation of clinical symptomatology and by the return to normal or reduction in the various modified biohumoral indices in all cases treated good tolerance absolute lack of side effects and toxicity
15010,special attention has been paid to study of possible changes to gastric mucosa by means of careful evaluation of endoscopic and histological findings
15011,the preoperative single dose oral administration of a combination of rapid and slow release diclofenac voltaren ciba geigy basel switzerland preparation in a placebo controlled trial proved to be more effective in postoperative pain prevention following third molar removal than the combination of intramuscular diclofenac and an oral depot formula
15012,forty nine patients with ureteral colic were included in this prospective double blind study investigating the analgesic efficacy and side effects of a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren versus a spasmolytic drug tropenzilium bromide palerol
15013,the analgesic efficacy and side effects of the calcium antagonist nifedipine nidilat applied sublingually in ureteral colic were also investigated
15014,it was concluded that diclofenac sodium was more efficient for relieving pain due to acute ureteral obstruction and had fewer side effects than spasmolytic drugs
15015,nifedipine proved to have an analgesic effect equivalent to that of tropenzilium bromide
15016,the results of study on evaluation of efficacy of combined treatment of patients with acute prostatitis are presented
15017,the study included patients with acute prostatitis aged to years
15018,patients in group received only basic therapy fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin mg times daily for days non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs suppositories voltaren mg at bedtime for days
15019,along with basic treatments patients in the group received phytopreparation prostagutt forte at a dose mg times a day which has antiestrogenic antiproliferative antiinflammatory immunomodulatory properties
15020,it was shown that patients receiving prostagutt forte experienced pronounced and significant decrease of white blood count in the prostatic secretion the decrease of prostate volume according to the data of transrectal ultrasound examination more rapid relief of the inflammatory process which was manifested by reduction of hyperthermia and reduction of severity of bladder outlet obstruction associated with swelling of the prostate
15021,we determined whether endogenously produced pge can down regulate the tumoricidal properties of macrophages by a negative feedback mechanism
15022,peritoneal exudate macrophages or resident peritoneal macrophages of mice were incubated in medium control or in medium containing ifn gamma and lps
15023,activated macrophages were highly tumoricidal against syngeneic melanoma cells and secreted high levels of pge
15024,treatment with indomethacin or diclofenac sodium voltaren completely inhibited the production and secretion of pge but not the tumoricidal activity of activated macrophages measured either immediately after activation or to days thereafter
15025,finally the addition of exogenous pge did not alter the ability of peritoneal exudate macrophages to respond to ifn gamma or of lps to produce high levels of tumor cell lysis
15026,collectively these results show that pge produced by activated macrophages is not a down regulator of their tumoricidal activity against adherent tumor cells
15027,enteric coated capsules are characterized by their resistance to dissolution in low ph environments such as the stomach and by their rapid disintegration in a higher ph environment such as the intestine
15028,the surface of hard gelatin capsules is usually smooth and nonporous which limits their coating efficiency
15029,we developed a simple quick and easily reproducible compounding preparation method for enteric release hard gelatin capsules
15030,twenty two batches of diclofenac sodium capsules each were prepared and then divided into three groups
15031,each group was submitted to a different coating process using a small scale enteric coating machine and a coating process based on the atomization spraying of organic solutions of polymers
15032,the results of dissolution testing were compared statistically within the groups and also with a reference drug control voltaren dr
15033,some of the batches in group i and all the batches in groups ii and iii met the pharmacopeial requirements for enteric release in both acid and ph phosphate buffer stages
15034,dissolution of capsules coated with eudragit l was more efficient than that of other tested systems p less than
15035,the dissolution assay results for group iii in the acid stage were superior to the results for the reference drug but no statistical difference was noticed between these two in the phosphate buffer stage
15036,diclofenac sodium hard gelatin capsules coated with cellulose acetate phthalate or eudragit l presented dissolution performance that met pharmacopeial requirements
15037,furthermore results obtained with eudragit coated capsules were comparable to those obtained with the reference drug
15038,this article presents the preparation and topical performance of some new lipid based formulations of diclofenac namely a a diclofenac aqueous gel containing mixed micelles sodium cholate egg lecithin molar ratio b diclofenac lotion that contains soya lecithin ethanol and buffer and c diclofenac lipogel containing egg lecithin isopropyl myristate propylene glycol and ethanol
15039,gel formulations were prepared using carbomer release of diclofenac from all formulations was monitored via dialysis through spectra por membrane into phosphate buffer m ph using a franz cell
15040,drug release profile and diffusion coefficients were compared with brand formulation geigy s vlotaren emulgel
15041,statistical analysis of data show that the diffusion coefficient of the drug from these formulations rank according to the following order diclofenac lotion d x cm s lipogel d x cm s voltaren emulgel x cm s aqueous gel mixed micelle x cm s
15042,these results show that diclofenac lotion and lipogel maybe more suitable formulations than the conventional topical dosage form
15043,a single dose comparative bioavailability study and an in vitro evaluation were conducted on two sustained release formulations of diclofenac sodium voltaren v and diclogesic d
15044,the two products were found similar in weight and content uniformity
15045,the in vitro dissolution however revealed that product d has a significantly faster rate of drug release compared to product v the bioavailability study was carried out on healthy male volunteers who received a single oral dose mg tablet of each product according to a randomized crossover design
15046,blood samples were obtained over a h period and drug concentrations were determined by an hplc assay
15047,the two products were not found to be statistically different with respect to the lag time between dosing and appearance of the drug in the serum and h for v and d respectively or in the time needed to attain the peak concentrations and h for v and d respectively
15048,the two products however varied in the peak serum concentration and ng ml for v and d respectively but this difference was not statistically significance
15049,in terms of the extent of absorption assessed by estimating the area under the concentration time curve over h the two products were not significantly different and ng h ml for v and d respectively
15050,these in vitro and in vivo findings indicate that diclogesic is characterized by sustained release properties which are comparable to voltaren
15051,to evaluate the antiviral activity of topical diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic and ketorolac tromethamine acular nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids on adenoviral replication in vitro and in the adenovirus ad mcewen new zealand rabbit ocular model
15052,the inhibitory concentration of ketorolac and diclofenac and their respective preservative components were determined for common ocular adenoviral serotypes ad ad ad and ad
15053,in a series of experiments ad mcewen inoculated new zealand rabbit eyes were treated topically times daily for days with either ketorolac diclofenac prednisolone acetate pred forte or control vehicle comfort tears
15054,outcome measures included serial ocular tear film titers and the formation of subepithelial immune corneal infiltrates
15055,in vitro neither ketorolac nor diclofenac demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against ad ad ad or ad
15056,in the rabbit model there were no statistically significant differences among ketorolac diclofenac and the control vehicle with respect to viral replication or the formation of subepithelial immune infiltrates
15057,in contrast prednisolone prolonged viral shedding and inhibited immune infiltrates p for both
15058,our experimental study suggests that treatment of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis with topical nsaids may be a safer alternative than topical steroids
15059,only controlled clinical trials can determine whether topical nsaids can provide symptomatic relief and not interfere with normal viral clearance
15060,a specific and sensitive method for the determination of diclofenac at concentrations down to ca
15061,ng ml the limit of detection being pg ml in human plasma and urine by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with h labelled diclofenac as internal standard is described
15062,the method is also suitable for the simultaneous assay of these two compounds when both are present in samples of human plasma or urine
15063,in this case chlorodiclofenac is used as internal standard
15064,after toluene extraction from plasma or without extraction for urine the method involves the formation of a dimethylindolinone derivative by extractive alkylation
15065,the technique was applied to determine low plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of labelled and unlabelled diclofenac after percutaneous applications of voltaren emulgel to humans applied simultaneously under occlusive dressing as deuterated diclofenac sodium and without occlusive dressing as unlabelled diclofenac sodium
15066,the controlled release of diclofenac sodium dfna from a chitosan oxidized konjac glucomannan cts okg polymer film was studied
15067,konjac glucomannan kgm was initially oxidized by sodium periodate and then cross linked to cts via imine bonds c n to form the new cts okg copolymer
15068,the dfna loaded cts okg polymers were characterized by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ft ir and x ray diffractometry xrd
15069,finally the release profiles of dfna from the cts okg polymer matrices were evaluated in a simulated gastrointestinal fluid system comprised of two hours in simulated gastric fluid sgf ph followed by h in simulated intestinal fluid sif ph
15070,a w w w ratio of cts okg dfna prepared at room temperature for hours gave the highest encapsulation efficiency ee of and resulted in a minimal release of dfna over h in sgf ph and a significantly improved sustained release in sif ph with and release over and h respectively some and five fold lower than that of the two commercial dfna preparations diclosian and voltaren
15071,this formulation may be used for further study as a long term intestine controlled release drug model at least days
15072,the case survey of drug induced hematologic disorders in shikoku district ehime prefecture disclosed patients
15073,cases were rheumatoid arthritis patients brain tumor one epilepsy liver cirrhosis one neuralgia one arthralgia one hyperthyroidism and one ibl like t lymphoma
15074,causative drugs for aplastic anemia were metalcaptase shiosol voltaren and emeside
15075,drug induced aplastic anemia was so severe that out of patients had died of bone marrow dysfunction
15076,neutropenia was caused by drugs as rimatil cefobit sepatren mercazole sulpyrin aleviatin cefamedin and metalcaptase
15077,the real causes of these drug induced hematologic disorders have not been clear
15078,remarkably high incidence among rheumatoid arthritis patients is suggestive several reasons as unique reactivity associated with hla suppression on hematologic stem cells by abnormal metabolites and immunologic dysfunction commonly seen in collagen diseases
15079,further studies of more accurate incidence of drug induced hematologic disorders are needed in investigating real causes of unhappy side effects
15080,topically administered indomethacin is used in the management and prevention of ocular inflammation and cystoid macular edema related to cataract surgery and in the maintenance of mydriasis during cataract surgery
15081,pharmaceutically the main obstacle in formulating indomethacin as eye drops is its low solubility and aqueous instability
15082,inclusion complexation of indomethacin with cyclodextrins cds was our interest in this research to obtain stable and effective aqueous indomethacin eye drops
15083,the influence of cd hydroxypropyl cd hp cd and sulfobutyl ether cd sbe cd on indomethacin solubility was investigated
15084,indomethacin hp cd complex was prepared and characterized by infrared spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry and x ray diffractometry and was subjected to in vitro release and stability studies
15085,the anti inflammatory effect of formulated indomethacin hp cd eye drops on chemically burned albino rabbit eyes was compared to those of indocollyre and voltaren eye drops
15086,hp cd was found to have a high solubilizing effect towards indomethacin and was thus selected for its formulation
15087,formulated indomethacin hp cd eye drops exhibited delayed release and high drug stability compared to the drug solution
15088,draize rabbit eye irritation test and histological examination on albino rabbit eyes treated with indomethacin hp cd eye drops revealed that these eye drops were non irritant
15089,the anti inflammatory studies indicated that formulating indomethacin eye drops via complexation with hp cd significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of the indomethacin compared to the investigated eye drops
15090,an aqueous ocular delivery system for the poor water soluble anti inflammatory indomethacin was prepared using hp cd as a complexing agent
15091,besides a sufficient solubility for the drug many factors were studied in the development of this system such as stability and safety
15092,in addition indomethacin hp cd eye drops showed promising management to corneal inflammation
15093,in addition to their well known anti inflammatory actions some of the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids appear to have an analgesic effect
15094,in human subjects the changes in threshold and intensity of sensations evoked by mechanical chemical and thermal stimulation of the cornea induced by topical administration of two commercial nsaids diclofenac sodium voltaren novartis basel switzerland and flurbiprofen ocuflur allergan irvine ca were studied
15095,corneal sensitivity was measured in young healthy subjects with a gas esthesiometer
15096,chemical co in air mechanical ml min and thermal corneal temperature changes between degrees c and degrees c around the normal value stimuli were applied to the center of the cornea
15097,the intensity and perceived magnitude of the psychophysical attributes of the evoked sensation were scored at the end of the pulse in a cm continuous visual analog scale vas
15098,the threshold was expressed as the stimulus intensity that evoked a vas score
15099,sensitivity was measured in both eyes of each subject on two separate days one without treatment and the other minutes after topical application of flurbiprofen seven subjects or diclofenac sodium six subjects
15100,diclofenac attenuated significantly all the sensation parameters evoked by high intensity mechanical chemical and thermal stimuli
15101,flurbiprofen produced a slight reduction of the sensations evoked by mechanical and chemical stimulation that became significant only for the irritation caused by chemical stimuli of maximum intensity co
15102,none of the drugs modified significantly the detection threshold of the different stimuli
15103,flurbiprofen had a very limited effect on sensations evoked by corneal stimulation whereas diclofenac reduced the intensity of sensations evoked by stimuli of different modality suggesting a mild local anesthetic effect of this drug on all types of corneal sensory fibers
15104,such anesthetic action could explain the analgesic effect that has been reported after topical application of diclofenac in inflamed human eyes
15105,two hundred consecutive patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic in reducing patient discomfort after cataract surgery
15106,other factors evaluated were the effect of preoperative flurbiprofen ocufen in preventing intraoperative miosis and on postoperative discomfort and the effect of incision size and intraocular carbachol miostat on postoperative comfort
15107,diclofenac significantly reduced discomfort during the first hours after surgery but not two to three days postoperatively although there was a trend toward reduction
15108,flurbiprofen given preoperatively did not affect postoperative discomfort
15109,it also did not affect pupil size at the start of surgery but did reduce intraoperative miosis
15110,incision size mm versus mm had no effect on discomfort
15111,miostat did not affect discomfort although there was a trend toward more discomfort
15112,the results indicate that topical diclofenac given immediately after cataract surgery significantly reduces discomfort during the first postoperative hours
15113,the bioavailability of a generic diclofenac sodium sustained release tablet preparation zolterol sr was compared with the innovator product voltaren sr twelve healthy adult male volunteers participated in the study which was conducted according to a randomized two way crossover design with a wash out period of one week
15114,the bioavailability of diclofenac was compared using the parameters area under the plasma concentration time curve auc infinity peak plasma concentration cmax and time to reach peak plasma concentration tmax
15115,no statistically significant difference was observed for both logarithmically transformed auc infinity cmax values and tmax value of the two preparations
15116,gamma hydroxybutyric acid ghb is a proposed neurotransmitter or neuromodulator with a yet unresolved mechanism of action
15117,ghb binds to both specific high affinity ghb binding sites and to gamma aminobutyric acid subtype b gaba b receptors in the brain
15118,to separate specific ghb effects from gaba b receptor effects it is imperative to develop ghb selective and potent compounds
15119,we generated the compound biphen yl hydroxybutyric acid which is the hydroxyl analogue of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid fenbufen referred to as gamma hydroxyfenbufen
15120,when measured in a rat brain homogenate h ncs binding assay gamma hydroxyfenbufen inhibited h ncs binding with a fold higher affinity than ghb k i microm thus establishing it as a novel lead structure
15121,the active metabolite of fenbufen biphenylacetic acid inhibited h ncs binding with a twofold higher affinity than ghb
15122,measuring the affinities of structurally related nsaids for the h ncs site identified diclofenac a clinically relevant nsaid voltaren diclon of the phenylacetic acid paa type as a ghb ligand k i value of microm
15123,other non nsaid paas also exhibited affinities similar to ghb
15124,our data raise the interesting possibility that the widely used over the counter drug compound diclofenac might affect ghb binding at relevant clinical dosages
15125,furthermore the identification of paas as ghb ligands supplies new information about the structural preferences of the ghb ligand binding site
15126,in the field of respiratory surgery there is a need for further research and clinical experience with thoracoscopic surgery
15127,it has already proved excellent for pain reduction and mizing of the wound
15128,we describe the method and results of thoracoscopic surgery which was started in june twelve cases are reported
15129,the procedure consist of trocar insertion observation by thoracoscopy lifting up and cutting off lung tissue drainage and removal of the trocar
15130,the most important technique needed by the operator is the cooperative motion of both hands which handle forceps gia and other instruments
15131,the two indications for thoracoscopic surgery are spontaneous pneumothorax bullectomy and diffuse interstitial pulmonary disease biopsy
15132,our operation time was to minutes
15133,no complication occurred on the eleven patients
15134,wound pain was controlled by diclofenac sodium voltaren suppositories on the first day
15135,the wounds spots cm in size healed well
15136,previous studies showed the effectiveness of early preoperative h before operation irradiation for prevention of heterotopic ossification ho after total hip replacement
15137,this procedure can result in logistic problems if there is a great distance between the department of radiotherapy and the orthopedic clinic
15138,to avoid these organizational problems a prospective study was undertaken to analyze the effectiveness of preoperative irradiation on the day preceding surgery h before operation
15139,between and patients were randomized to receive a prophylactic therapy for prevention of heterotopic ossification
15140,forty six patients were irradiated with gy single dose within h before operation
15141,fifty four patients were treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid voltaren resinat x mg day for weeks
15142,heterotopic ossification was scored according to the brooker grading system
15143,one hundred patients receiving no prophylactic therapy after total hip arthroplasty between and were analyzed and defined as the historical control group
15144,incidence of heterotopic ossification was in the gy preoperative group brooker score i ii iii iv and in the nsaid group brooker score i ii iii iv
15145,regarding overall heterotopic ossification there was a significant difference between the nsaid group and the gy group p
15146,analyzing the clinically significant heterotopic ossification brooker score iii and iv there was no significant difference between the two treatment arms p
15147,in the untreated historical control group the incidence of heterotopic ossification was brooker score i ii iii iv
15148,referring to overall and to clinically relevant heterotopic ossification the incidence of ho was greater in the control group than in the prophylactically treated groups p
15149,irradiation within h before operation and use of nsaid voltaren resinat can reduce the incidence of clinically relevant heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement
15150,the effect of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs naid such as voltaren acetylsalicylic acid indometacin and naproxen on the efficacy of immunostimulators in treatment of infections caused by proteus and staphylococcus was studied
15151,it was shown that except naproxen the naid were capable of decreasing resistance to proteus infections
15152,acetylsalicylic acid increased resistance to staphylococcal infections
15153,the rest of the drugs did not change it
15154,prodigiozan increased resistance to the infections at the background of the naid
15155,however volteran and indometacin lowered its effect in infections caused by proteus
15156,levamisol stimulated resistance of mice to the infections at the background of volteran and increased resistance to proteus infections lowered by acetylsalicylic acid
15157,methyluracyl was not able to increase resistance to the infections at the background of the naid
15158,it only increased resistance to proteus infections lowered by acetylsalicylic acid
15159,levamisol and methyluracyl did not as a rule increase efficacy of antibiotic therapy at the background of the naid
15160,four commercial gel preparations of topical anti inflammatory agents have been assessed in six animal models commonly used to determine the biological activity of non steroidal anti inflammatory agents for systemic administration
15161,only uv induced erythema of the skin adjuvant induced arthritis and the measurement of vascular permeability proved suitable for differentiation of the potency of the four topical agents
15162,carrageenin induced paw oedema the cotton pellet test and the assessment of the pain threshold according to randall and selitto were of little value
15163,the effects of the gel preparation of diclofenac cas diethylammonium voltaren emulgel were comparable to two preparations containing and active ingredient respectively
15164,gel showed low overall activity
15165,the experiments demonstrated that some of the models used for the assessment of anti inflammatory agent for systemic administration proved suitable for the testing of topical preparations and that percutaneous absorption was insufficient to elicit anti inflammatory effect in the animals at sites remote from the site of application
15166,the efficacy and tolerability of mg suppositories of diclofenac sodium voltaren and indomethacin were investigated in relieving symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
15167,thirty patients were included in a double blind cross over study for two weeks six days with diclofenac suppositories following two days with placebo and six days with indomethacin
15168,diclofenac sodium and indomethacin were given in random order
15169,both treatments improved the status of the disease as compared with the situation before the treatment p less than
15170,no statistically significant difference was found between the efficacy of indomethacin and diclofenac sodium as regards both the doctor s and the patient s global assessments
15171,the two treatments were equally well tolerated
15172,a study was made of the effects of voltaren naproxen flurbiprophen and ibuprophen comparatively to those of acetylsalicylic acid butadion and indomethacin on the reactions of kininogenesis and biological effects of bradykinin
15173,it was found that in therapeutic concentrations m the drugs do not inhibit baee esterase activity but nonspecifically inhibit with the exception of flurbiprophen and butadion the kininogenase activity of the highly purified human blood plasma kallikrein
15174,a good agreement was discovered in rats between the anti inflammatory action and protective effect of the drugs on the toxicity of the kininogenesis stimulant cellulose sulfate
15175,when administered in effective concentrations and doses these drugs exerted an unmarked inhibitory effect on the degree of the spasmogenous and microcirculatory reactions to exogenous bradykinin
15176,hydrophilic colloids interact with metallic ions to yield crosslinked insoluble salts
15177,such principle was utilized in the preparation of diclofenac sodium beads from sodium alginate and sodium carboxymethylcellulose
15178,hard spherical beads of aluminum alginate and aluminum carboxymethylcellulose with a narrow particle size distribution and mm and low friability and respectively were obtained with high yield and a drug content approaching
15179,the type and concentration of the polymers as well as the ph of the dissolution medium were found to affect the rate of drug release
15180,beads prepared from na alginate showed a non significantly p faster rate of drug release than that prepared from nacmc
15181,the higher the polymer concentration the slower was the rate of drug release
15182,diclofenac sodium did not release in n hcl ph for h and released in phosphate buffer solution ph from the two formulations studied and from the commercial voltaren retard tablet
15183,the two formulations of the beads resulted in a sustained release action of diclofenac sodium for h they showed kel values of and h and these correspond to t of and for the na alginate and nacmc beads respectively
15184,they also showed mean residence time mrt values of and h respectively
15185,they also showed non significant p differences with respect to their plasma levels cmax tmax and auc h the relative bioavailability of the two formulations were and respectively relative to that of the commercial voltaren retard tablets of ciba geigy which showed a kel of h corresponding to a t of h and mrt of h
15186,the effects of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac voltaren and an opiate oxycodone oxanest on postoperative pain were compared
15187,included in the study were candidates for various operations
15188,patients requesting an analgesic were given either mg of diclofenac or mg of oxycodone as an intramuscular injection
15189,the onset of analgesic effect occurred within min with oxycodone and within min with diclofenac
15190,the analgesic effect of diclofenac was slightly weaker than that of oxycodone on a pain scale of after h and after h
15191,the patients again asked for an analgesic after an average of h in the oxycodone group and after an average of h in the diclofenac group
15192,the average number of injections required until the first postoperative morning was in the oxycodone group and in the diclofenac group
15193,side effects patients in the oxycodone group reported a total of side effects and eight patients in the diclofenac group a total of side effects
15194,diclofenac is an alternative to opiates in the management of postoperative pain
15195,it is especially useful in patients in whom opiates cause side effects
15196,nonsteroid antiinflammatory preparations influencing biosynthesis of renal prostaglandins are able to produce certain changes in hemodynamics of the organ with successive ischemia
15197,administration of these preparation indomethacin and voltaren to rats in doses corresponding to human therapeutic ones produces dystrophic changes in the canalicular epithelium of the nephron and appearance of infiltrates in the interstitium and in the lamina propria of the renal calyxes mucous membrane
15198,intercellular edema and changes in configuration of the cells decreasing electron density of hyaloplasm swelled mitochondria diluted cysterns of the golgi complex and of the endoplasmic reticulum are general regularities in ultrastructural reorganization of the cells in response to administration of the two preparations
15199,these changes differ only in degree of their manifestation
15200,as demonstrate the results the pharmacologic depression of the prostaglandin synthesis causes decreased blood supply of the kidneys and successive depression of their functional state
15201,this can be considered as risk factors of the renal complications under treatment with the nonsteroid antiinflammatory preparations
15202,a randomized double blind parallel group clinical trial compared diclofenac sodium voltaren ciba geigy summit nj with aspirin for the treatment of acute sprains and or strains of the knee or ankle
15203,one hundred thirty nine patients were admitted to the study
15204,patients received either mg mg twice daily of diclofenac n or g g three times daily of aspirin n for to days
15205,forty seven diclofenac patients and aspirin patients mean age for both groups years were evaluated to determine the efficacy of each treatment
15206,both groups experienced significant p less than improvements for all efficacy variables measured
15207,treating sprains and strains with diclofenac rather than with aspirin allowed an earlier return to activity
15208,of those patients who achieved playing fitness those in the diclofenac group resumed athletic activities in a mean of days compared with a mean of days for patients in the aspirin group
15209,although the overall multivariate f was nonsignificant p the univariate f for days required to resume playing fitness was significantly p shorter in the diclofenac group
15210,while the nonsignificant multivariate result suggests that the significance may be due to chance it is also possible that there was a trend toward earlier resumption of activities with diclofenac treatment compared to aspirin but an insufficient sample size to demonstrate the trend statistically
15211,since others have reported such a trend without the greater controls of a multivariate analysis this area warrants further research
15212,the eyes of consecutive radial keratotomy patients were treated topically with either diclofenac sodium voltaren solution or with tears naturale control group preoperatively and postoperatively in a prospective randomized double masked study
15213,during the first postoperative day patients completed a questionnaire on discomfort level present at minutes and at one three six and hours after surgery
15214,patients treated with topical diclofenac were generally more comfortable than patients in the control group
15215,they had a significantly lower rate of moderate or severe discomfort and a higher rate of less than mild discomfort
15216,peak discomfort occurred at three hours in both groups
15217,the prescribed optional oral analgesic was taken by of patients in the diclofenac group and by of those in the control group
15218,this study is designed to compare the therapeutic effects and safety of traditional chinese medicine cm therapy and western combined therapy wm in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis ra
15219,after weeks treatment the efficacy safety and the improvement on symptoms of traditional chinese medicine in patients and western medicine therapy in patients of ra were analyzed
15220,cm therapy included glucosidorum tripterygll totorum tablet and yishen juanbi tablet
15221,the wm therapy included voltaren extended action tablet methotrexate and sulfasalazine
15222,the american college of rheumatology acr and responses were employed as primary end point analysis and the symptoms as secondary end point analysis
15223,all data were analyzed on spss statistical package
15224,the acr and acr responses in wm were higher than in cm group but more improvement on the symptoms and less adverse events were observed in cm therapy
15225,the cm symptoms in ra could be grouped into four symptom combinations with factor analysis method
15226,the factor loading value difference which reflects the degree of improvement in responded cases was lower than in non responded cases in the symptom combination the loading value difference in both responded and non responded cases in cm treated patients were higher than those in wm treated group in the symptom combination and
15227,wm combined therapy was more effective in the treatment of ra in acr evaluation but more improvement on cm symptoms were seen in the cm therapy
15228,the dissolution behaviour of a direct compression compact prepared with sodium diclofenac and dibasic calcium phosphate dcp in different weight ratios with or without biosoluble polymer acrylic based resin was investigated in distilled water and in a medium with changing ph
15229,the results indicate that the amount of sodium diclofenac released from the compact was dependent on the amount of drug and dcp used in the compact and was also controlled by the amount of biosoluble polymer added
15230,a chemical reaction forming diclofenac acid might occur on the surface of the sodium diclofenac compact during exposure to the acidic medium which was confirmed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
15231,the tablet with a weight ratio of sodium diclofenac to dcp exhibited a sustained release behaviour similar to commercial sustained release products voltaren sr and grofenac retard but a lower release rate was found as compared to the commercial products
15232,the dissolution behaviour of the study tablet and the commercial products was found to be dependent on the dissolution medium and the rotating speeds
15233,glass beads were added to the dissolution assembly to simulate the influence of food and the enhanced friction between tablet and glass beads might result in a higher dissolution rate of the tablet and the commercial products
15234,the medical prescriptions of house officers working at the policlinique universitaire de m decine in geneva were analyzed for a period of working days and provide insight into drug therapy chosen for outpatients at consultations
15235,these patients were prescribed an average of drugs each or per call
15236,of the different drugs thus prescribed the following were chosen most frequently in decreasing order digoxin hygroton lexotanil metamucil voltaren aspirin different insulins and aldomet
15237,antimicrobial agents accounted for only of all prescriptions while vitamins and fortifiers represent an even lower percentage
15238,it would be possible to limit the number of drugs since half of the prescriptions cover drugs and of all prescriptions cover drugs
15239,prescription patterns vary markedly from one subspecialty of internal medicine to another but also between physicians working in the same field
15240,house officers in charge of given sectors of the city internists not working in a subspecialty may thus prescribe between and drugs per patient whereas the number of drugs chosen may vary between and some quaint individual preferences for drugs were also noted and the trend is analyzed
15241,the data is compared with results of the few existing similar studies and offers food for thought on prescription habits directed ultimately towards a more rational approach to drug therapy for outpatients
15242,to conduct the first canadian study of the comparative efficacy and safety of tenoxicam and diclofenac in patients with primary osteoarthritis oa of the knee
15243,tenoxicam mg per os once daily po od was compared to diclofenac voltaren mg per os times a day po tid in a week double blind randomized controlled multicenter parallel trial
15244,the primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the womac oa index
15245,following an initial screening visit and a to day nsaid free washout period i e baseline patients were assessed at weeks and assessments including some efficacy variables and safety variables
15246,ninety eight patients tenoxicam n diclofenac n participated in the trial
15247,statistically significant p or improvements in all dimensions of the womac oa index and six efficacy variables were noted in both treatment groups
15248,no significant between drug differences were noted on any efficacy variable
15249,significantly fewer patients reported adverse events in the tenoxicam group vs p
15250,tenoxicam is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with oa of the knee
15251,in this group of patients it was similar in efficacy and superior in tolerability to diclofenac mg day mg tid
15252,thus the benefit risk ratio of tenoxicam was superior to that of diclofenac in this study
15253,the study was designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of diclofenac in plasma subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle tissue after repeated topical administration using mika diclofenac spray gel a novel formulation and after oral dosing using voltaren mg enteric coated tablets
15254,diclofenac mg was administered topically three times daily for days onto a defined area of the thigh of healthy males
15255,after a day wash out period subjects were orally treated with mg diclofenac three times daily for days
15256,in vivo microdialysis in subcutaneous and muscle tissues was performed immediately after the final doses from both treatments on day and h later
15257,plasma samples were taken simultaneously
15258,the relative bioavailability of diclofenac in subcutaneous adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was substantially higher after topical compared with oral dosing and respectively whereas relative plasma bioavailability was fold lower
15259,plasma c max values were approximately fold lower after topical compared with oral drug administration i e
15260,median values ng ml ci and ng ml ci ng ml
15261,both treatments were well tolerated
15262,owing to its favourable penetration characteristics and low systemic availability mika diclofenac spray gel is a rational alternative to oral diclofenac formulations for the treatment of inflammatory soft tissue conditions
15263,we compared the effect of argon laser trabeculoplasty alt and nd yag laser trabeculoplasty ylt on inflammation and intraocular pressure iop
15264,twenty two patients scheduled for bilateral trabeculoplasty were treated with an argon laser in one eye and with nd yag laser in the controlateral eye
15265,visual acuity iop and anterior chamber inflammation measured with the laser flare cell meter were controlled at hours and days after trabeculoplasty
15266,our results showed a similar pressure lowering effect in both groups after ylt versus after alt at days post laser p
15267,the anterior chamber inflammation was delayed and more important in the alt group inflammation peaked at hours after ylt versus hours after alt p maximal mean flare increase ph msec
15268,after alt versus ph msec
15270,all eyes with inflammation were successfully treated with topical diclofenac qid voltaren ophtha a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agent
15271,ylt is a safe and effective alternative technique to perform laser trabeculoplasty which is especially useful in poorly pigmented angles where alt is known to be less effective
15272,diclofenac sodium voltaren was tested over a period of six months in a double blind experiment for its antiphlogistic and analgesic effect
15273,a retained or impacted lower third molar was removed from each of the patients studied
15274,the postoperative course was evaluated in terms of the criteria of pain trismus swelling and side effects and the results were recorded
15275,the swelling was objectified by photographic documentation and planimetric measurements
15276,our studies indicated that diclofenac sodium can also be recommended for the medicamentous prophylaxis of swelling and pain resulting from dental procedures
15277,the aim of the study was to compare treatment with diclofenac sodium voltaren x mg to occlusal splint therapy in a randomized single blind controlled trial of patients with a diagnosis of temporomandibular joint tmj osteoarthritis oa in accordance with research diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders
15278,patients with general joint disorders or restrictions against medication with non steroidal anti inflammatory drug were not included
15279,twenty seven females and two males aged years included answered a standardized questionnaire and were clinically examined and they underwent tmj tomography
15280,the treatment was randomized to either splint n or diclofenac n
15281,the temperatures over the tmjs were determined
15282,the patients were re examined week month and months after the start of treatment
15283,a year follow up was carried out using questionnaires
15284,after week of treatment with diclofenac significant reductions of pain and discomfort tmj tenderness and joint pain on jaw movements were noted
15285,the splint therapy gave a significant reduction of reported symptoms after month of treatment
15286,both treatments gave few adverse effects and were on an equal level
15287,estimation of the degree of inflammation by measuring the surface temperature over the tmj was not reliable
15288,structural changes of the symptomatic tmjs were radiographically found in the contralateral symptom free tmj had changes in
15289,there was a discrepancy between the clinical and the radiographical findings
15290,diclofenac gave a more rapid improvement but both treatments gave a significant reduction of symptoms of tmj oa within months which remained at the one year follow up
15291,in a double blind between patient study of patients with sports injuries of the knee diclophenac sodium voltaren was significantly superior to oxyphenbutazone tanderil and placebo in improving the degree of swelling and the condition of the injured knee
15292,both drugs were superior to placebo with regard to analgesia by the second day of treatment
15293,in addition diclophenac sodium significantly improved the condition of the injured knee by the end of the trial
15294,three patients dropped out of the trial for reasons not related to the drug
15295,two patients in the diclophenac sodium group failed to complete the trial due to rapid recovery and each in the diclophenac sodium and oxyphenbutazone groups because of poor tolerability
15296,nine patients who completed the trial reported mild to moderate side effects consisting mainly of drowsiness and nausea
15297,to report corneal complications associated with topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
15298,retrospective noncomparative interventional case series
15299,eighteen eyes of patients with adverse corneal events associated with nsaid use
15300,evaluation of patients referred for management of corneal complications during use of topical nsaids ketorolac tromethamine acular diclofenac sodium voltaren diclofenac sodium falcon dsos
15301,type and severity of corneal complications
15302,of the patients two experienced severe keratopathy three experienced ulceration six experienced corneal or scleral melts and five experienced perforations
15303,eleven patients had recent cataract surgery nine of these were on concurrent topical steroids and antibiotics
15304,another patient who did not have recent surgery was using concurrent topical steroids without antibiotics for sarcoid uveitis
15305,systemic associations included two patients with rheumatoid arthritis one patient with asymptomatic sjogren s syndrome and two with rosacea
15306,topical nsaids were associated with corneal complications in eyes of patients
15307,potential risk factors include conditions that predispose the patient to corneal melting concurrent topical steroids and epithelial keratopathy in the early postoperative period
15308,cross linked high amylose starches have been developed as excipients for the formulation of controlled release solid dosage forms for the oral delivery of drugs
15309,advantages of this new class of excipients include cost effectiveness readily accessible industrial manufacturing technology high active ingredient core loading and the possibility of achieving a quasi zero order release for most drugs
15310,in addition to the latter other features distinguish cross linked high amylose starches from other excipients used to prepare hydrophilic matrices
15311,among these are the absence of erosion the limited swelling and the fact that increasing cross linking degrees results in increased water uptake rate drug release rate and equilibrium swelling
15312,thus the goal of the present study was to gain some insights into the mechanism of drug release control by matrices of cross linked high amylose starch
15313,water transport kinetics and dimensional changes were studied in matrices placed in water at degrees c by an image analysis technique
15314,the results show that in the first min a gel layer is formed at the surface of the tablet after which the gel front seems to halt its progression toward the center of the tablet
15315,water continues to diffuse through the front and to invade the core
15316,as a consequence this latter swells with a predominance for radial swelling
15317,equilibrium swelling is reached over days when the water concentration in the tablet becomes homogeneous and the whole tablet gelifies
15318,solid state c nmr were acquired on cross linked high amylose starch powders tablets and hydrated tablets with varying cross linking degrees
15319,they show a predominance of the v type single helix arrangement of amylose in the dry state irrespective of the cross linking degree
15320,upon hydration the homologues with a low cross linking degrees show a transition from the v to the b type double helix arrangement
15321,it is therefore hypothesized that the capacity of amylose to undergo the v to b transition is an important factor in controlling water transport and drug release rate
15322,finally applications to different drugs are reviewed briefly
15323,they illustrate the versatility of this technology as generic versions of zero order oros drug efidac and fickian release conventional matrices voltaren sr were developed and successfully tested in pilot clinical studies to be bioequivalent to the references
15324,these studies further showed that cross linked high amylose starch matrices have the lowest inter subject variability among the systems tested and show a total absence of food effect
15325,to observe and study the toxic and side effects of water extracts from euodiae fructus accompanied with its efficacy analgesic dose and its mechanism in order to provide experimental basis for the correlation between its efficacy toxicity
15326,mice were randomly divided into groups according to weight namely the normal group the voltaren group and euodiae fructus water extracts high middle and low dose groups
15327,mice were administered with drugs for consecutively seven days abdominally injected with acetic acid at min and treated with hot plates after the last administration to establish the pain model in order to the toxic and side effects accompanied with the efficacy
15328,besides toxic symptoms in mice activities of alt and ast and content of bun and cr in serum were detected to calculate indexes in livers and kidneys
15329,the other part of serum was collected to detect the content and activities of pge mda sod no nos gsh and gsh px in serum
15330,continuous oral administration of water extracts from euodiae fructus of efficacy dose could significantly decrease the frequency of writhe in mice and increase the hot plate pain threshold with good dose efficacy relationship
15331,during the administration mice showed such toxic symptoms as diarrhoea idle move dysphoria and slow growth of weight
15332,the activities of both alt and ast in serum and hepatic tissues were remarkably increased and the liver size remarkably increased without notable chance in content of bun and cr in serum
15333,kidney size increased in only the high dose group
15334,the content and activities of pge sod gsh gsh px in serum notably decreased where the content and activities of mda no nos in serum increased
15335,the above mentioned changes gradually aggravated with the rise in dose
15336,there was significant difference compared with the model group showing dose toxicity relationship to certain extent
15337,continuous oral administration of certain dose of water extracts from euodiae fructus to mice can generate the toxic and side effects in liver accompanying with the analgesic effect and show dose dependence relationship to some extent
15338,its analgesic mechanism is related to the reduction of pge content in blood while its toxic mechanism is related to oxidative injury to some extent
15339,to evaluate the ability of topical diclofenac to decrease corneal opacity after excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy prk
15340,twenty new zealand white rabbits underwent a unilateral nm excimer laser myopic photorefractive keratectomy to correct diopters
15341,there were four groups of five rabbits each
15342,the first group of rabbits received postoperative topical treatment with placebo voltaren ophthalmic vehicle the second group received topical diclofenac the third group received topical corticosteroid fluorometholone and the fourth group received diclofenac and fluorometholone
15343,in the first month the topical drugs were applied four times daily and in the second month twice daily
15344,corneal haze was graded from totally clear to completely opaque cornea
15345,slit lamp pictures were obtained at weeks and and keratometry readings was performed at weeks and at week the rabbits were killed and the eyes were submitted for histologic examination
15346,at week there was less corneal haze in the diclofenac treated animals and in the fluorometholone treated animals than in the control group but only in the diclofenac treated group was the difference statistically significant
15347,combination treatment with diclofenac and fluorometholone did not result in a further decrease in haze
15348,these data suggest that diclofenac and fluorometholone may influence corneal wound healing in rabbits after excimer laser prk and support a potential role for using topical nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs in preventing the development of excessive corneal haze after excimer laser surgery
15349,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sodium diclofenac on the bioavailability of amoxicillin
15350,in this randomised crossover study with a week washout period volunteers received a g oral dose of amoxicillin amoxil group or a g oral dose of amoxicillin with mg of sodium diclofenac voltaren group
15351,blood samples were collected at and h following drug administration
15352,high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection was used to quantify plasma amoxicillin concentrations
15353,bioassay micrococcus luteus atcc was performed to verify the antimicrobial efficacy of amoxicillin in vitro
15354,the pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma concentration time curve auc maximum plasma concentration observed during the h study period c max and renal clearance cl were analysed by analysis of variance and time at which c max occurred t max and volume of distribution vd were analysed by wilcoxon test p
15355,for group the mean standard deviation auc c max and t max values were microg min ml microg ml and min respectively and for group the values were microg min ml microg ml and min respectively
15356,lower values of auc and c max were observed for group p
15357,cl of amoxicillin increased p by in group suggesting that sodium diclofenac may interfere with amoxicillin renal excretion
15358,in conclusion sodium diclofenac can significantly reduce the bioavailability of amoxicillin
15359,the intratumor distribution of vascular permeability in two transplantable rat tumors was studied by calculating tissue plasma ratios of two intravenously injected labeled albumins with an interval of five hours between albumin injections
15360,the data were calculated and presented as the capillary permeability surface area product ps in multiple tumor biopsies
15361,furthermore the intratumor distribution of blood flow was studied by the intratumor uptake of intravenously injected rb
15362,the same parameters were also studied in normal striated muscle
15363,prolonged administration of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor diclofenac sodium voltaren changed significantly the tumor blood flow towards higher values
15364,a similar change was observed in animals with induced thrombocytopenia
15365,tumor ps values were increased by administration of diclofenac sodium but not by induced thrombocytopenia
15366,the intratumor distribution of plasma volume calculated from tissue plasma values of albumin injected minutes before the animals were killed was not significantly changed as well as blood flow plasma volume and ps in normal muscle
15367,there was no significant correlation between separate tumor blood flow and ps values while such a significant correlation was found in normal muscle
15368,the observations made in this study suggest that a release of both prostaglandins and serotonin might be included in the regulation of tumor blood flow and vascular permeability
15369,in a double blind study diclofenac sodium voltaren mg two or three times a day was compared with placebo in patients with pain localized to the temporomandibular joint tmj
15370,the patients were allocated into two equally large groups
15371,a visual analog scale was used to estimate the pretreatment degree of pain
15372,the treatment effect was assessed as the frequency of joint and muscle pain and by the patients own evaluation of improvement
15373,the change in the clinical condition was assessed by tenderness to palpation of the tmj and masticatory muscles and by mandibular mobility
15374,the frequency of tmj pain showed a greater reduction in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group and there was a significant reduction of daily tmj pain in the diclofenac group
15375,the diclofenac group also showed a significant decrease in tenderness to palpation of the masticatory muscles in comparison with the placebo group
15376,the patients with short duration of pain showed the best response to diclofenac
15377,there was no evidence in this study to prove that diclofenac should be used as a primary treatment of tmj pain but it could be used as a complement to other treatments of acute tmj pain
15378,this study aimed to compare the anti inflammatory and analgesic effects of topical diclofenac sodium voltaren with prednisolone sodium phosphate ophthalmic solution after strabismus surgery
15379,a prospective double masked randomized two center clinical trial
15380,eighty eyes of patients undergoing strabismus surgery were examined
15381,for week after surgery the eye that was operated on received one drop of either diclofenac or prednisolone four times a day
15382,the diclofenac and prednisolone treated eyes were compared on postoperative days and with respect to signs of inflammation e g erythema edema discharge patient comfort and conjunctival incisional healing
15383,on postoperative day in eyes that received prednisolone the conjunctival defects were larger p and more frequent p
15384,for all subjects despite adequate statistical power there was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory scores between eyes that received diclofenac or prednisolone
15385,in cases of bilateral surgery however there was less postoperative erythema and edema in the diclofenac treated eyes
15386,in the first week after strabismus surgery topical diclofenac proved at least as effective as prednisolone in controlling inflammation and discomfort with less delay in incisional wound healing
15387,topical diclofenac a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agent may be considered for use after strabismus surgery in place of corticosteroids
15388,to measure the efficacy and safety of diclofenac sodium gel in patients with primary hand osteoarthritis oa
15389,in a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial men and women aged or years diagnosed with primary oa in the dominant hand were randomly assigned to self apply topical diclofenac sodium gel voltaren gel n or vehicle n to both hands times daily for weeks
15390,primary outcome measures included oa pain intensity mm visual analog scale total australian canadian osteoarthritis hand index auscan score and global rating of disease activity at and weeks
15391,secondary outcomes included onset of efficacy in weeks and durability of efficacy at weeks measures of disease activity in the dominant hand pain intensity in the non dominant hand auscan subindices end of study rating of efficacy and osteoarthritis research society international response criteria
15392,diclofenac sodium gel decreased pain intensity scores by total auscan scores by and global rating of disease by
15393,significant differences favoring diclofenac sodium gel over vehicle were observed at week for pain intensity and auscan with a trend for global rating of disease activity
15394,at week diclofenac sodium gel treatment significantly improved each primary outcome measure compared with vehicle
15395,secondary outcomes generally supported the primary outcomes
15396,the most common treatment related adverse event ae was application site paresthesia
15397,most ae were mild
15398,no cardiac events gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers were reported
15399,topical diclofenac sodium gel was generally well tolerated and effective in primary hand oa
15401,topically applied nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are frequently used to prevent miosis during cataract surgery to treat ocular allergies to prevent excessive postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery and to treat cystoid macular edema following cataract surgery
15402,they have also been used to control pain and photophobia following radial keratotomy and excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy
15403,during august of severe complications following topical nsaid use including corneal melting were reported by members of the american society of cataract and refractive surgery ascrs responding to a survey distributed in letters from ascrs to its members
15404,the purpose of this report is to review cases of corneal melting in patients treated with topical nsaids with special attention to the observed toxicity and its relationship to dose and duration of treatment coexistent disease and therapies and the indication for treatment
15405,the goal of this study is to identify factors useful in minimizing the occurrence of corneal toxicity
15406,the medical records and or histories of patients with corneal melting associated with the use of topical nsaids are reviewed with special attention to the indication for treatment the dose and duration of treatment and coexistent diseases and medical treatments
15407,in addition the relationship between nsaid treatment and surgery and between nsaid treatment and onset and extent of corneal toxicity are described
15408,each of the patients appeared to suffer severe corneal toxicity following the topical use of diclofenac ophthalmic solution
15409,generic diclofenac falcon alcon laboratories inc fort worth texas was associated with and voltaren ciba vision atlanta georgia with of these cases
15410,duration of treatment prior to corneal melting varied from days to months
15411,associated ocular and systemic diseases and their respective treatments complicate the analysis of these cases
15412,in addition the indication for treatment with topical nsaids was frequently unclear
15413,the inconsistent and variable dose toxicity relationships suggest that coexistent factors other than a simple drug toxicity are implicated if not causative in nsaid associated corneal melting
15414,these cases demonstrate the importance of making a clinical diagnosis before treatment and of following the clinical course of patients carefully during treatment
15415,drug drug interaction between a commercial diclofenac sodium enteric coated tablet voltaren v and a ranitidine hcl tablet zantac z was evaluated using a dual radiotelemetric technique according to a randomized three way latin square crossover design balanced for carryover effects
15416,v and z were given either alone or in combination treatment v z v z with a day washout period between treatments
15417,eighteen fasted subjects swallowed a tethered
15418,heidelberg ph capsule to provide continuous gastric ph
15419,then the assigned treatment drug and another heidelberg ph capsule were given simultaneously
15420,the free ph capsule provided information regarding gastric residence time grt
15421,serial blood samples were obtained for up to hr after dosing and drug levels were determined by validated hplc methods
15422,treatment effects on auc cmax tmax tlag tmax tlag and t were not significant except cmax which differed slightly for both v and z when given in combination as compared to alone
15423,gastric residence times were and min for treatments v z and v z respectively
15424,gastric exposure of the enteric coated tablet of diclofenac was estimated by ph values obtained from the tethered capsule
15425,median ph values at and min prior to gastric emptying were and for the combination treatment versus and for diclofenac alone
15426,the results of this study indicated that there was minimal drug drug interaction between diclofenac and ranitidine
15427,the gastric ph range resulting from this study did not influence the oral absorption of enteric coated diclofenac
15428,one hundred forty eight patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic in reducing ocular inflammation following extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation
15429,eligible patients were enrolled and randomized diclofenac placebo if the sum of anterior chamber cells plus flare one day postoperatively baseline was at least four
15430,none of the patients received concomitant steroidal anti inflammatory treatment
15431,the patients receiving diclofenac sodium had significantly greater improvement from baseline in summed flare plus cell score than the placebo patients at two to five days and seven to nine days after baseline
15432,similarly diclofenac sodium patients had significantly less post baseline conjunctival erythema and ciliary flush than placebo patients
15433,significantly more diclofenac sodium patients than placebo patients showed moderate to marked improvement from baseline in overall assessment of inflammatory response
15434,forty nine percent of placebo patients but only of diclofenac patients were considered therapeutic failures p
15435,by five to seven days of diclofenac sodium patients and of placebo patients had corrected visual acuities of or better p
15436,there were no clinically important differences in mean intraocular pressure at any visit
15437,fifty patients undergoing phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation were randomly assigned to receive either diclofenac sodium eye drops voltaren ophthalmic cibavision ophthalmics duluth ga or prednisolone acetate eye drops pred forte allergan pharmaceuticals irvine ca as their postoperative anti inflammatory medication
15438,the patients were examined one day one week and one month after surgery and their postoperative inflammation was evaluated both by slit lamp assessment of cell and flare and by objective measurement of cell and flare with the kowa fc laser cell and flare meter
15439,at each visit the level of postoperative inflammation was the same for the two study groups
15440,thus diclofenac sodium was as effective an anti inflammatory agent for postoperative inflammation as prednisolone acetate
15441,interleukin il has been shown to induce inflammatory reactions in part through increased prostaglandin production
15442,prostaglandins of the e and i type sensitize nociceptors in peripheral tissues
15443,we have therefore investigated the effect of il perfusion in the isolated rabbit ear a model which allows the assessment of peripheral pain
15444,natural il from human monocytes il from glioblastoma cells as well as recombinant il alpha or beta increased the pain reflex induced by acetylcholine in a concentration dependent manner
15445,the pge levels were measured in the perfusate and were found to be enhanced more than fold after the infusion of il alpha or il beta
15446,this effect was paralleled by the enhanced pain reflexes and persisted for at least one hour after cessation of the il perfusion
15447,both the increased pain reflexes as well as the enhanced pge levels were abolished by addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac na voltaren to the perfusion fluid
15448,these results show that besides the numerous known physiological functions of il it may also play a role in peripheral pain sensations
15449,the authors present the case of an year old woman with pain in her left hip
15450,x ray showed moderate osteoarthritic changes
15451,the patient was prescribed diclofenal sodium voltaren a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid
15452,the patient continued use of the drug and returned months later complaining of severe hip pain and difficulty in walking
15453,x ray at that time showed necrosis of the femoral head with subluxation and formation of a pseudoacetabulum
15454,total hip replacement was performed and the patient resumed normal daily activity
15455,the authors point out that avascular necrosis of the femoral head a known complication of steroid therapy can also be caused by nsaid therapy and urge physicians to be aware of this complication
15456,laboratory studies in experimental animals suggest that use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs decreases the incidence of posterior capsular opacification pco following cataract surgery
15457,recently the incidence of pco following cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation was reported to be no different following postoperative treatment with diclofenac sodium voltaren ciba vision or with dexamethasone maxidex alcon
15458,we studied the incidence of pco in patients following treatment with diclofenac and ketorolac tromethamine acular allergan ophthalmic solutions years after cataract surgery and implantation of a foldable silicone intraocular lens
15459,a total of patients underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of a foldable silicone intracular lens
15460,patients were treated with either diclofenac ophthalmic solution or ketorolac ophthalmic solution times daily for days in a double masked randomized fashion during the postoperative period
15461,patients were examined years following surgery by a masked observer who determined which patients received yag capsulotomies and graded any existing pco
15462,each treatment group had yag capsulotomies years following surgery
15463,although pco was present more often with diclofenac treatment than with ketorolac treatment this difference is not statistically significant p
15464,patients tolerated both treatments well without a difference in toxic effects or tolerability
15465,this study did not demonstrate a difference in the ability of diclofenac or ketorolac ophthalmic solutions to prevent pco following cataract extraction and implantation of an intraocular lens
15466,both treatment regimens were equally well tolerated
15467,treatment of corneal abrasions often involves antibiotic ointment and pressure patching
15468,the corneal abrasions following excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy have been managed with disposable soft contact lenses and diclofenac voltaren eye drops
15469,we report patients with corneal abrasions from trauma or recurrent corneal erosions treated with application of a disposable soft contact lens and instillation of diclofenac and antibiotic eye drops
15470,all patients reported significant pain relief and all abrasions healed within days most within hours
15471,two of the recurrent erosion patients suffered subsequent spontaneous abrasions and one of the traumatic abrasion patients developed a possible infectious keratitis which cleared without visual loss
15472,in this small series the combination of a disposable soft contact lens and the instillation of diclofenac drops provided significant pain relief while the abrasion healed and allowed the patients to function with binocular vision
15473,this treatment regimen offers an alternative to pressure patching in the treatment of corneal abrasions
15474,diclofenac sodium voltaren prevents surgically induced miosis during extracapsular cataract extraction in a more long lasting way than indomethacin indocid
15475,just before the iol implantation in eyes treated with diclofenac sodium eye drops the apparent mean pupil size was constricted by approximately mm less than in the control group p
15476,at the same critical moment of the pupils treated with diclofenac sodium and only of the pupils in the control and indomethacin groups were larger than mm
15477,forty three athletes presenting with unilateral iliotibial band friction syndrome itbfs were randomly divided into three groups for the first days of treatment placebo controlled double blind placebo n anti inflammatory medication n voltaren geigy and analgesic anti inflammatory combined medication n myprodol rio ethicals
15478,all subjects rested from day to day and all groups received the same physiotherapy outpatient treatment programme from day to day on days and the subjects performed a functional treadmill running test maximum minutes during which they reported pain scale no pain unbearable pain each minute
15479,total running distance total running time and the area under the pain v time curve was calculated
15480,daily hour recall pain scores were also recorded
15481,the hour recall pain scores decreased significantly for all the groups over the treatment period
15482,this method of assessing efficacy of treatment therefore failed to show differences between groups
15483,in contrast during the running test only group improved their total running time and distance from day to day whereas in all the groups the area under the pain v time curve decreased from day to day all the other groups improved total running time and running distance from day to day all three treatment modalities are effective in the early treatment of itbfs but physiotherapy in combination with analgesic anti inflammatory medication is superior
15484,abstract truncated at words
15485,chorionic gonadotropin cg used at and iu ml concentrations was introduced into a short term macroculture of splenocytes of cba mice suppressors fractionated on a nylon wool column
15486,regulatory effects of cg were evaluated in a syngeneic transfer system by the degree of inhibition of a humoral immune response in recipients
15487,it was found that cg iu ml inhibits the functional activity of splenocyte suppressors
15488,the observed effect of the hormone was blocked by introduction into the incubation medium of the inhibitor inositol monophosphatase lithium and did not depend on cyclooxygenase voltaren or potential independent ca channel verapamil inhibitors
15489,determination of the intracellular camp level by radioimmunoassay revealed a reliable increase of this secondary messenger in splenocyte suppressors during their incubation with cg
15490,the ability of cg iu ml to inhibit the functional activity of intact t lymphocytes but not b cells was established
15491,the suppressive hormone activity was also followed by camp level increase in target cells
15492,these findings suggest that the mechanism of a transmembrane transfer of the cg signal in splenocyte suppressors is related to the adenylate cyclase system and probably to phosphoinositide metabolism products
15493,the relative bioavailability of four monolithic enteric coated mec diclofenac products was compared in healthy volunteers
15494,only one generic product was fully bioequivalent with the reference product voltaren with regard to auc cmax and tlag
15495,two products showed significant differences in tlag
15496,in a second experiment with eight volunteers the influence of increased gastric ph ranitidine treatment on the two mutually most differing products was studied
15497,they showed equivalence in auc but not in cmax
15498,analysis of tlag suggests that the product with the low tlag disintegrates within the non acid stomach whereas the product with the long tlag passes the non acid stomach intact
15499,several in vitro dissolution tests were conducted
15500,the european pharmacopeia test did not detect any differences between the products
15501,at ph both with and without mechanical stress only the product with the shortest tlag released diclofenac
15502,the in vivo results were best predicted by the in vitro dissolution tests performed at several fixed ph values with mechanical stress
15503,to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability of a sustained release pellet formulation of diclofenac olfen sr depocaps sr cap mepha ltd aesch switzerland with the standard reference formulation voltaren retard sr tab novartis pharma ag basel switzerland both containing mg diclofenac sodium in patients with osteoarthritis oa of the knee and or hip
15504,in addition diclofenac s current place in the symptomatic therapy of oa is briefly reviewed
15505,in this week double blind active controlled non inferiority trial oa patients were randomised to receive either sr cap once daily or sr tab once daily n for both groups
15506,the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in visual analogue scale vas pain score mm at rest at day compared with baseline
15507,secondary variables included the change in vas pain score on movement and global assessments of efficacy and tolerability using verbal rating scales vrs
15508,between baseline and day mean sd vas pain score at rest decreased by mm in the sr cap group n compared with mm in the sr tab group n based on the per protocol population
15509,comparable changes were observed in the intention to treat population
15510,the lower bound of the sided confidence interval was mm and greater than the prespecified non inferiority limit of mm
15511,there was a trend towards a better tolerability with sr cap compared with sr tab based on mean sd vrs scores sr cap sr tab for assessment by patients p
15512,sr cap is as effective as and possibly better tolerated than sr tab in patients suffering from painful oa
15513,ten patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhotic hepatitis without portal decompensation diagnosed by biochemical laparoscopical and histological criteria were given mg diclofenac na voltaren p o
15514,in order to evaluate plasma concentration h after application of diclofenac and urinary excretion of diclofenac resp
15515,hydroxylated metabolites h after application
15516,mean values of the kinetic parameters auc cmax tmax and renal excretion were not different as compared to ten healthy controls
15517,elimination and metabolism of diclofenac was not influenced by the liver diseases
15518,a dose reduction seems not to be necessary in patients with chronic liver diseases without portal decompensation
15519,the murine popliteal lymph node assay plna was examined as a preclinical assay with the potential to identify low molecular weight compounds lmwcs that are likely to be associated with immune mediated drug hypersensitivity reactions idhrs in humans
15520,we hypothesized that the contact sensitizer oxazolone ox would cause a strong pln reaction in naive mice and that the pln reaction would be attenuated in mice orally pretreated with ox due to the induction of oral tolerance
15521,in naive mice ox induced a strong pln reaction and caused dose dependent increases in pln size weight cellularity percentage of cd pln t cells and percentage of pln b cells with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cd pln t cells
15522,next the plna was conducted in mice gavaged three times with either ox or vehicle alone olive oil
15523,mice pretreated with ox had suppressed pln reactions following the footpad injection of ox decrease in pln size weight and cellularity which was associated with an increase in the percentage of pln cd t cells
15524,in contrast oral pretreatment with ox had no observable effect on the pln reaction induced following footpad injection of the irrelevant hapten dinitrochlorobenzene dncb
15525,adoptive transfer studies were conducted to examine the mechanism of pln hyporesponsiveness
15526,it was found that either unfractionated splenocytes or purified cd splenocytes but not purified cd splenocytes isolated from mice gavaged with ox adoptively transferred pln suppression to naive balb c mice
15527,because ox is not a pharmaceutical we also examined the nsaid diclofenac df voltaren
15528,like ox df caused dose dependent increases in pln size weight and cellularity in naive mice
15529,furthermore like ox the diclofenac induced pln reaction was attenuated in mice that had been orally pretreated three times with df
15530,however splenocytes from mice orally treated with df were not able to adoptively transfer pln hyporesponsiveness
15531,collectively these observations demonstrate that both ox and df are potent immunostimulators in the plna
15532,as importantly these results demonstrate that the immunostimulating potential of ox and df in the plna is significantly decreased in mice orally exposed to the respective drug possibly due to the presence of a cellular mechanism of oral tolerance
15533,for ox the mechanism appears to involve in part cd t cells whereas the mechanism s associated with pln hyporesponsiveness using df remain to be defined
15534,we report a case of severe colitis from diclofenac voltaren one of a number of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids that can cause colonic injury
15535,the patient a yr old woman presented with acute onset of bloody diarrhea having taken diclofenac for more than yr colonoscopy revealed deep ulcerations in the transverse colon and erythema and erosions scattered elsewhere
15536,biopsy findings included crypt distortion cryptitis hemorrhage and some fibrosis
15537,also in one biopsy taken from an area of deepest ulceration a large non foreign body type granuloma was seen raising the specter of crohn s colitis
15538,all symptoms subsided within h after discontinuation of the diclofenac and follow up colonoscopy days later showed complete endoscopic and histological resolution
15539,patients and physicians should be aware of the possibility of colitis from nsaids
15540,in rare cases some will show granulomatous change that may be confused with crohn s disease
15541,early recognition and discontinuation of nsaids is crucial to prevent clinical worsening that could lead to colectomy or even prove fatal
15542,cba and cba x cbl f male mice were used in experiments
15543,one h incubation of splenocytes with chorionic gonadotropin cg in doses or mu ml statistically significantly reduced the count of antibody producing cells detectable in the syngeneic transfer system
15544,addition of cona or recombinant human interleukin to the splenocyte culture did not alter the processes of the formation of antibody producing cells
15545,addition of cg simultaneously with cona resulted in discontinuation of the immunosuppression induced by a low hormone dose whereas mu ml of cg in the presence of cona had a marked immunodepressant effect
15546,combination of interleukin with cg lead either to immunosuppression cessation mu ml or to more than twofold stimulation of the adoptive immune response mu ml
15547,voltaren a cycloxygenase inhibitor was used in some experiments to elucidate the degree of endogenic prostaglandin relationships with the mechanisms of cg immunomodulating effects
15548,cycloxygenase activity was found to be related to the immunosuppressive effect of cg low dose whereas the costimulating effect of a high dose of the hormone in the presence of interleukin was unrelated to endogenic prostaglandin synthesis
15549,sulfur mustard sm is a potent vesicant known for its ability to cause incapacitation and prolonged injuries to the eyes skin and respiratory system
15550,the toxic ocular events following sulfur mustard exposure are characterized by several stages photophobia starting a few hours after exposure an acute injury phase characterized by inflammation of the anterior segment and corneal erosions and a delayed phase appearing following a clinically silent period years in human
15551,the late injury appeared in part of the exposed eyes expressed by epithelial defects and corneal neovascularization nv that lead to vision deficits and even blindness
15552,during the last years we have characterized the temporal development of ocular lesions following sm vapor exposure in rabbits and have shown the existence of two sub populations of corneas those exhibiting delayed ocular lesions clinically impaired and those exhibiting only minor injuries if at all clinically non impaired
15553,the aim of the present study was to investigate the pathological mechanism underlying the delayed injury by focusing on the unique characteristics of each sub population and to test the efficacy of potential treatments
15554,clinically impaired corneas were characterized by chronic inflammation increased matrix metalloproteinase mmp activity poor innervation and limbal damage
15555,moreover using impression cytology and histology we identified the delayed lesions as typical for an ocular surface disorder under the category of limbal epithelial stem cell deficiency lscd
15556,these results point to therapeutic directions using anti inflammatory drugs mmps inhibitors neurotrophic factors and amniotic membrane transplantation
15557,topical anti inflammatory drugs either steroid dexamycin dex or non steroidal anti infllammatory drug nsaid voltaren ophtha were found to be beneficial in ameliorating the initial inflammatory response and in postponing the development of corneal nv when given during the first week after exposure
15558,when dex was administered as a symptomatic treatment against nv a significant regression in the angiogenic process was observed however the effect was temporal and blood vessels reappeared after therapy ceased
15559,chronic administration weeks of the mmp inhibitor doxycycline was also effective in attenuation of the acute and delayed injury
15560,preliminary results using amniotic membrane transplantation revealed some decrease of corneal edema with no effect on corneal nv
15561,it is suggested that the chronic inflammation and prolonged impairment of corneal innervation are playing a role in the pathogenesis of the delayed lscd following sm exposure by creating a pathological microenvironment to limbal epithelial stem cells thus leading to their slow death and to a second cascade of pathological events eventually resulting in severe long term injuries
15562,as of today only topical anti inflammatory drugs reached the criteria of an applicable efficient post exposure ocular treatment for sm injuries
15563,further studies are required to investigate the effects of sm on epithelial stem cells and their involvement in the pathogenesis of the long term injuries
15564,the pig has been suggested as an animal model in biomedical research because of its physiological similarity to man
15565,therefore the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of diclofenac sodium voltaren were studied in four yucatan minipigs after intravenous administration of and mg and oral administration of mg in a solution of ml buffer ml water and ml water and the results compared to historical data in man
15566,the absolute bioavailability after oral administration of ml buffer ml water and ml water solutions were and respectively compared to approximately in man
15567,the total plasma clearance in minipigs was fivefold slower than in humans vs ml hr kg
15568,the plasma levels of the metabolites hydroxy hydroxy hydroxy dihydroxy and hydroxy methoxy diclofenac were considerably lower in minipigs than in man after both i v
15569,and oral administration
15570,these results suggest slower metabolism and or enterohepatic recirculation of the parent drug in minipigs
15571,the volume of distribution of the central compartment was less in humans than in pigs vs ml kg
15572,the terminal half lives of the parent drug were similar in pigs hr and humans hr
15573,the rate of oral drug absorption increased in the order of ml aqueous ml aqueous and ml buffered solutions ka and hr respectively
15574,these trends are similar in man and suggest that both buffering and intake volume can affect diclofenac absorption

15576,to observe the clinical efficacy of wangbi tablet wt on the treatment of knee osteoarthritis koa and to study its treatment program by integrative medicine
15577,the randomized parallel control and multi center clinical observation method was used
15578,koa patients of gan shen deficiency complicated with stasis blood blockade syndrome were assigned to three groups
15579,group a cases was treated by wt group b cases was treated by votalin tablet and group c cases was treated by wt votalin tablet
15580,all patients were treated for two months
15581,before and after treatment the clinical symptoms the knee function activity adverse reactions were observed and recorded
15582,erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and c reactive protein crp of each patient were respectively detected statistically analyzed and compared
15583,after eight weeks of treatment significant difference was shown in the time of morning stiffness in joints joint tendemess swelling pain joint functional activities esr and crp between group a and group b p
15584,besides better effects were obtained in group c p
15585,improvement of esr and crp they were obviously improved in the three groups after treatment p
15586,as for the markedly effective rate better effects were obtained in group c p
15587,in the treatment of koa wt showed favorable effects with no obvious adverse reaction
15588,the combination of wt and voltaren tablet was significantly superior to use of wt or votalin tablet alone
15589,it could reduce the dosage of voltaren tablet and avoid adverse reactions of the gastrointestinal tract
15590,we performed the double blind study comparing the two groups of patients with osteoarthrosis
15591,one group was receiving one lubor ampoul a day during days while the other group received also one ampoul of voltaren during days
15592,the other group consisted of patients with soft tissue rheumatism who were treated with lubor or ketonal cream during days
15593,the duration of the morning stiffness of the knee joint was shortened significantly in the patients who were treated by lubor ampouls
15594,the intensity of pain during various activities was also significantly reduced
15595,the objective parameters the distance between the top of the patella and the xypohoid process and the extent of movements were improved at the end of the therapy
15596,in the patients treated with lubor cream we observed the significant reducement of the intensity of the pain
15597,two new forms of lubor ampouls and cream with capsules and suppositories enrich the large choice of this drug it can be given in the large number of implications it has the better adjustment of application and doses
15598,because of the very rare side effects it provides the safety for the patient and physician
15599,the buccal delivery of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug diclofenac sodium voltaren from a prototype hydrogel was studied in man in a randomized crossover design of buccal delivery and i v
15601,after a min delay plasma levels of diclofenac increased to near steady state levels of ng ml by hr
15602,with each subject serving as his own control the i v
15603,infusion data facilitated the calculation of a mean steady state flux of diclofenac sodium of mg cm hr across human buccal mucosa and a time lag of hr
15604,the large flux of this ionized species indicates that the traditional lipoidal model of buccal permeation based on the partition coefficient is inadequate
15605,twenty four patients with localized myofascial pain were treated with injections with ml lidocaine and with ml diclofenac voltaren mg given in the trigger point
15606,the effect of therapy was measured by visual analogue scale vas during h corresponding to the expected pharmacological period of effect
15607,despite the small number of patients a clear trend was seen towards better treatment results with diclofenac and after h the difference between the two treatments was significant p less than
15608,compared with the pain score value at the start the treatment with diclofenac gave a significant alleviation p less than after h whereas treatment with lidocaine did not give any significant change in pain level
15609,the demonstrated effect of a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor illustrates how inflammation is involved as an etiological factor in myofascial pain
15610,a randomized prospective double blind study of the analgesic effect of mg intramuscular diclofenac sodium voltaren a potent prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor versus placebo saline solution was carried out in consecutive patients with acute ureteral colic
15611,diclofenac provided complete relief of pain minutes after the injection in of the cases while placebo provided relief in p less than
15612,forty patients in the placebo group and seventeen patients in the diclofenac group needed an open injection of mg diclofenac intramuscularly after minutes due to persistent pain
15613,fifty four of the fifty seven patients treated with an open injection of diclofenac achieved complete relief of pain after minutes
15614,there were no side effects of the treatment
15615,pulse therapy with methylprednisolone was provided to patients with bekhterev s disease bd resistant to indomethacin voltaren and phenylbutazone therapy with psoriatic arthritis pa
15616,the drug was injected i v
15617,at a dose of mg for days running
15618,a rapid analgetic and antiinflammatory effect was noted in both groups
15619,ten patients with bd and with pa demonstrated considerable improvement improvement
15620,a positive trend in all indices of therapeutic efficacy was noted
15621,in bd change in of indices was statistically significant in pa in
15622,a decrease in initially elevated serum igg concentrations in both groups was statistically insignificant
15623,the content of igm and iga before treatment was within normal and the change resulting from pulse therapy was statistically insignificant
15624,a decrease in initially elevated levels of blood serum circulating immune complexes was statistically significant in both groups
15625,pulse therapy was well tolerated
15626,the influence of diclofenac sodium voltaren on glucose metabolism was investigated in a group of maturity onset diabetics treated by a standard diet alone
15627,a second group of patients with maturity onset diabetes well controlled by a standard diet and tolbutamide rastinon was examined for a possible drug interaction
15628,determinations of capillary blood glucose as well as assessments of urine sugar by clinitest and hour urine glucose determinations were regularly done before and during treatment with diclofenac sodium
15629,the results of this study show no alteration of glucose metabolism
15630,these laboratory data suggest that there is no clinically relevant interaction between diclofenac sodium and tolbutamide
15631,neither the blood glucose profiles of the individual patients nor those of the two above mentioned groups showed any alterations of blood glucose concentration
15632,diclofenac sodium a non steroidal antirheumatic drug may be recommended in the treatment of rheumatic diseases in diabetics
15633,indomethacin naproxen sulindac diftalon and diclofenac are more recently developed antirheumatic drugs which have been specially tested in diabetics
15634,in a random cross over study eight healthy volunteers received single mg doses of enteric coated diclofenac sodium tablets as either voltaren ciba geigy or anfenax istituto biochimico italiano after an overnight fast
15635,the bioavailability of these two preparations of diclofenac sodium did not differ significantly as judged by absorption lag time peak plasma concentration time to peak plasma concentrations or area under the plasma concentration time curve
15636,diclofenac was found to have a plasma clearance of s d
15637,and ml min kg a plasma terminal half life of elimination of and h and an apparent volume of distribution of and l kg the values obtained with the ciba geigy preparation being shown before the istituto biochimico italiano preparation in each case
15638,to determine the mode of protective effects of misoprostol against the chronic gastrointestinal ulceration from the nsaid diclofenac studies were undertaken in domestic pigs a model of human gastrointestinal ulceration to determine the effects of repeated daily dosing for days of diclofenac mg kg day twice a day as voltaren tablets on the gastrointestinal morphology fe red blood loss mucosal myeloperoxidase mpo activity as an indicator of leukocyte infiltration and mucosal leukotrienes lts and the mucosal protective effects of micrograms kg day misoprostol twice a day as cytotec tablets given with diclofenac mg kg day twice a day compared with diclofenac mg kg day alone and aspirin mg kg twice a day usp tablets as a standard
15639,these effects were compared with the dose range for potential diarrheagenic effects of misoprostol determined by fecal analysis of na k cl ca ho and phenol red transit given alone or with diclofenac to determine if this could be discriminated from antiulcer effects of misoprostol
15640,plasma and gastric mucosal concentrations of the drugs were determined to establish if misoprostol affects diclofenac absorption elimination and vice versa
15641,the results showed that diclofenac produced gastric mucosal damage without any prior or concurrent bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract although aspirin significantly increased blood loss misoprostol produced a dose related reduction in diclofenac induced mucosal damage of the upper gastrointestinal tract no significant increase in mucosal mpo occurred with diclofenac despite mucosal damage being evident mucosal lts were unaffected by the drug treatments plasma gastric and intestinal concentrations of diclofenac were not affected by misoprostol while conversely plasma misoprostol concentrations were not influenced by the diclofenac treatment no significant effects on fecal water electrolyte or phenol red transit times were observed with an of the drug treatments and mild diarrhea observed as loose bowel motions was only observed in most pigs receiving the misoprostol treatments during fasting on days thus misoprostol protects against chronic lesions ulcers in the upper gastrointestinal tract from diclofenac without signs of diarrhea becoming evident the latter occurring when there is reduced food intake generalized leukocyte infiltration or effects on mucosal lts or any reduction in bioavailability of diclofenac
15642,the aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of thermography in detecting the postoperative inflammatory reaction after third molar removal
15643,thermographic images novatherm novamedix ltd hampshire england of both cheeks were obtained on the first and seventh postoperative days after removal of impacted mandibular third molars under local anesthesia in patients men women
15644,the unoperated contralateral side served as a control
15645,one of the following pretreatments was given immediately before the operation diclofenac voltaren novartis espoo finland mg orally rapid release mg and prolonged release mg n diclofenac mg orally prolonged release and mg intramuscularly n or placebo n
15646,the postoperative skin surface temperature on the operated side was significantly higher than that on the unoperated side
15647,the thermal difference was degrees c degrees c on the first postoperative day and declined significantly by the seventh day to degrees c degrees c both p
15648,the thermal difference in patients receiving diclofenac preoperatively was significantly smaller degrees c degrees c at day and degrees c degrees c at day than in patients receiving placebo degrees c degrees c at day and degrees c degrees c at day p
15649,however with equal doses of diclofenac the combination of rapid release and prolonged release tablets orally was more effective in reducing skin temperature than an orally administered prolonged release tablet combined with intramuscular injection p
15650,thermography is a suitable method to measure the inflammatory reaction related to third molar removal
15651,thermal changes are significant and are decreased by the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac
15652,to investigate the effect of qingpeng paste qp on collagen induced arthritis cia in rats
15653,cia was established in female wistar rats with injection of type ii bovine collagen at the base of the tail of animals
15654,cia rats were treated daily with external administration of different doses of qp or voltaren beginning on the day after the onset of arthritis day until day paw swelling rate and the serum levels of il beta were determined
15655,moreover the expression of tnf alpha and il alpha and histopathological changes in the arthritic joints were also observed
15656,qp markedly suppressed the paw swelling rate of arthritic rat reduced the expression of tnf alpha and il alpha in synovial membrane
15657,histopathological changes in the arthritic joints were also significantly ameliorated in the qp treated versus vehicle treated rats
15658,however the elevated serum levels of il beta in arthritic rats were not influenced by qp
15659,the present findings demonstrate the protective property of qp on collagen induced arthritis mechanisms underlying it may be related to reduce the expression of il alpha and tnf alpha in synovial membrane
15660,in a prospective study the influence of sole diclofenac na therapy x mg rewodina voltaren on the calculus recurrence rate of eight frequently relapsing and therapy resistant calcium oxalate stone patients is analysed
15661,during a period of one year s treatment the recurrence rate could be reduced by from to calculi
15662,serious side effects changes in blood serological parameters and various urine components were not observed
15663,the course of passages of calculi was improved by reduced pain and rapid passage
15664,the paper summarizes all results of calcium oxalate stone treatments with nonsteroidal antiphlogistics known so far
15665,in the opinion of the authors the present successful diclofenac na treatment offers a novel possibility of influencing therapy resistant stone formers over long periods
15666,the case of a year old healthy woman is described who developed an extreme sinus bradycardia min with chest pain and acute right heart failure associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and elevation of the liver enzymes while simultaneously taking tizanidine sirdalud diclofenac voltaren and rofecoxib vioxx
15667,the symptomatology resolved promptly after stopping the medication
15668,the usual causes of sinusbradycardia like hypothyroidism hypothermia intracranial pressure elevation typhoid fever sick sinus syndrome hyperreactive carotid sinus reflex organic heart disease electrolyte disorders and pharmacotherapy with beta blockers digitalis and antiarrhythmics have been excluded in this case
15669,bradycardia can occur as a side effect of tizanidine
15670,as this substance is metabolized by cytochrome p a and rofecoxib inhibits this enzyme an interaction between these drugs is probable
15671,liver function disorders and gastrointestinal symptoms in the present case mainly due to the acute right heart failure have also been described as side effects under tizanidine diclofenac as well as rofecoxib
15672,supposedly the combination of tizanidine rofecoxib used to be prescribed frequently for lumbar pain as selective cyclooxygenase cox inhibitors are visibly replacing the nonsteroidal antirheumatics due to their better side effect profile
15673,an augmented risk of cardiovascular events under rofecoxib led to its withdrawal from the market at the end of september
15674,when prescribing sirdalud the possible pharmacological side effects and interactions should be taken into careful account
15675,to investigate whether topical diclofenac sodium solution voltaren ophthalmic is as efficacious as topical ketorolac tromethamine solution acular in the treatment of established chronic cystoid macular edema cme after uneventful phacoemulsification cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens iol implantation
15676,referral based vitreoretinal private practice
15677,this randomized prospective study comprised consecutive patients with clinical cme after uneventful phacoemulsification cataract extraction with posterior chamber iol implantation who were referred to a private vitreoretinal practice for evaluation and management
15678,exclusion criteria included a history of previous intraocular surgery vitreous loss during cataract surgery cme uveitis and vitreoretinal pathology
15679,the eye with cme was treated with drop times daily of diclofenac sodium solution or ketorolac tromethamine solution
15680,outcomes were measured by observing for improvement in cme and visual acuity
15681,both treatment methods resulted in a significant reduction in cme and a significant improvement in visual acuity
15682,within weeks diclofenac reduced cme in patients and ketorolac in patients p confidence interval ci
15683,within weeks diclofenac eliminated cme in patients and ketorolac in patients p ci
15684,the mean time to initial cme reduction was weeks with diclofenac and weeks with ketorolac p ci
15685,the mean time to cme resolution was weeks with diclofenac and weeks with ketorolac p ci
15686,diclofenac sodium solution and ketorolac tromethamine topical ophthalmic solution eyedrops were equally effective in reducing the severity and duration of cme after uneventful phacoemulsification with posterior chamber iol implantation
15687,either solution may be considered for cme after cataract surgery especially in patients who may not tolerate corticosteroid treatment
15688,a comparative bioavailability study and in vitro characterization were conducted on two commercial products of diclofenac sodium voltaren a and inflaban b in the form of enteric coated tablets and mg
15689,the two products were found similar in weight variation and content uniformity and both met the british pharmacopeia requirements of disintegration for enteric coated tablets
15690,the dissolution in vitro revealed that product b was characterized by a faster rate compared to product a the bioavailability of single doses x and x mg of each product was carried out respectively on and normal male volunteers according to a randomized complete block design
15691,blood samples were obtained over a hour interval and serum concentrations of the drug were determined using an hplc assay
15692,the two products were found bioequivalent as assessed by auc
15693,however the tmax value was found to be significantly smaller for product b compared to product a indicating that product b is apparently absorbed at a faster rate
15694,further product b was characterized by higher cmax values although these were not statistically different from the corresponding values of product a these findings are consistent with the in vitro dissolution pattern of the two products and the differences in the rate of absorption may have therapeutic implications
15695,in this paper the case of year old female who consumed the drug to aid smoking cessation is presented
15696,this drug is taken by her simultaneously with other including prescribed drugs and non prescribed
15697,according to the list of her medicines it may be concluded that she suffers from hypertension which is also declared by her and heart failure or atrial fibrillation
15698,the additional treatment with the drug to aid smoking cessation tabex may increase the blood pressure
15699,the control of blood pressure may be even more difficult if non prescribed drugs with hypertensive effect are taken
15700,in analyzed subject there were two nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ibuprom voltaren acti and ginseng extract bodymax
15701,in summary it must be underlined that in elderly subject on nicotine substitute therapy uncontrolled consumption of over the counter drugs may potentially worsen the result of hypotensive therapy
15702,results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non cemented prostheses can at the very least temporarily be impaired by the application of non steroidal antiphlogistic agents such as diclofenac
15703,it is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages times mg daily on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses
15704,to investigate this cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications
15705,our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines
15706,the measurable maximal plasma concentration h after the application of one tablet voltaren reached micrograms ml
15707,this correlated with diclofenac concentrations between and ml found in our experiments
15708,the detected values were correlated to the control group microgram ml diclofenac
15709,the drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells
15710,the proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells compared to untreated cells was found to be decreased
15711,we observed a decrease to at a diclofenac concentration of microgram ml osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to at the same concentration
15712,the dna synthesis increased to in stromal bone marrow cells in osteoblasts to
15713,in contrast we detected a neglectible decrease to in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells
15714,the synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to
15715,the alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to
15716,temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression
15717,osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition
15718,the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agent diclofenac voltaren has recently become commercially available in form of eyedrops voltaren ophtha
15719,in the present study we compared the anti inflammatory effect of a topical combination therapy with diclofenac and prednisolone vs indomethacin and prednisolone
15720,the fc laser flare cell photometer kowa was used to investigate patients before and after cataract surgery with iol implantation
15721,this method allows quantitative in vivo determination of aqueous flare and aqueous particle concentration
15722,the patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment protocols protocol a diclofenac eyedrops and prednisolone eyedrops inflanefran forte protocol b indomethacin eyedrops chibro amuno and prednisolone eyedrops
15723,one drop of either drug was administered times per day to each patient
15724,treatment with nonsteroidal agents started on the day before surgery whereas prednisolone treatment started immediately at the end of surgery
15725,no parabulbar or oral steroids were administered
15726,in group a diclofenac and prednisolone the flare in photon counts ms increased from a preoperative value of mean sd to on the st postoperative day
15727,this value is significantly p higher than in group b indomethacin and prednisolone on the st postoperative day the aqueous particle concentration on day after surgery was also significantly p higher under treatment with diclofenac and prednisolone than with indomethacin and prednisolone vs particles mm respectively
15728,on the rd postoperative day the differences between the two treatment groups were no longer present
15729,in the early postoperative period after cataract surgery the anti inflammatory effect of a topical combination therapy with diclofenac and prednisolone is weaker than that of indomethacin and prednisolone
15730,however this difference is no longer observed on day after surgery so that there is probably no major difference in clinical outcome between the two treatment protocols
15731,to compare effect of two topical non steroidal anti inflammatory nsai drugs indomethacin indocollyre chauvin inc and diclofenac voltaren cibavision on postoperative pain and epithelial regrowth following surface excimer photoablation
15732,eighty six excimer operated patients were divided in two similar groups depending on the nsai instilled postoperatively and for days drops daily
15733,no patient was informed of any other available drug
15734,pain intensity was quantified between and according to an analog scale reported from to hours then times a day during days
15735,complementary medications and functional symptoms were also notified
15736,biomicroscopic evaluation using fluorescein test was performed to assess reepithelialization
15737,in term of pain no significative difference was observed between the two groups concerning intensity associated medications or numbers of days of discomfort
15738,controversially retreated eyes might induce more pain than initial treatments
15739,no delay in epithelial regrowth was noted and the difference between the two groups in functional complaints was no statistically significant
15740,pain appears to be not related to ablation depth
15741,discussion conclusion our results are correlated to literature reported data
15742,introduction of nsai constitutes a real advent in the care of excimer postoperative pain
15743,effect of indomethacin seems comparable to diclofenac effect but might be of interest because of no anesthetic property that might guarantee of no delay in wound healing response
15744,the laser flare cell meter lfcm kowa fc an instrument measuring aqueous flare and cells in a quantitative objective and non invasive way has been mainly used so far to measure inflammation in clinical and experimental research
15745,in the light of some illustrative examples its practical clinical usefulness is presented the lfcm was found to be specially helpful in types of situations
15746,in acute anterior uveitis aau patients precise lfcm monitoring of inflammation made it possible to avoid excessive corticosteroid therapy mainly by more rapid and controlled tapering at the end of an inflammatory episode so possibly minimizing steroid side effects in a group of patients prone to numerous uveitis recurrences
15747,in a steroid responder patient it allowed successful treatment of a flare up of aau with a combination of systemic and topical diclofenac voltaren a potent nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug
15748,lfcm monitoring of inflammation in patients undergoing laser treatments allowed optimal adjustment of antiinflammatory therapy
15749,diclofenac drops voltarene ophta were sufficient to treat inflammation in all patients undergoing nd yag laser posterior capsulotomy or argon laser trabeculoplasty
15750,in patients with acyclovir treated herpes simplex or herpes zoster uveitis corticosteroid treatment should be avoided whenever possible because of the tendency to develop steroid dependency
15751,lfcm monitoring of this group of patients gave a precise evolutionary pattern of inflammation and permitted to avoid steroid treatment in many patients
15752,patients frequently have ocular pain photophobia foreign body sensation and burning stinging after radial keratotomy
15753,this study was a prospective randomized double masked multicenter fellow eye comparison of diclofenac sodium voltaren ophthalmic solution and placebo for controlling these ocular symptoms after bilateral radial keratotomy
15754,patients who were pain free in both eyes before surgery were randomly assigned to treatment with diclofenac sodium in one eye and placebo in the other
15755,one drop of each masked trial medication was administered min before surgery min and h after surgery at bedtime on the day of surgery and four times daily for additional days
15756,patients evaluated ocular symptoms in each eye and h after surgery and provided a global evaluation and h after surgery
15757,for each assessment the difference in scores between eyes was analyzed by using a paired t test
15758,diclofenac sodium was significantly p superior to placebo in controlling each ocular symptom at each interval after surgery and for patient global assessments and h after surgery
15759,diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solution is clinically effective in controlling adverse ocular symptoms occurring after bilateral radial keratotomy
15760,in a multicentric interindividual double blind study the analgesic action duration of effect tolerability and side effects of the new combination preparation combaren diclofenac na mg codeine phosphate mg were compared with those of diclofenac na mg voltaren in patients with severe tumor related pain
15761,the results show that combaren is a highly effective preparation for the treatment of severe tumor pain
15762,the combination of diclofenac na with codeine phosphate leads to a clear statistically significant augmentation of the effectiveness of additionally used analgesics on pain severity and the general effectiveness of the combination is more positively assessed that that of monotherapy with diclofenac also effective
15763,in the staged approach to the treatment of malignancy related pain in which the aim is to provide continuous preventive analgesia rather than ad hoc treatment of newly developing or worsening pain this combination preparation will presumably find a permanent place in stage i ii of the generally accepted staged pain treatment scheme
15764,prophylactic diclofenac voltaren in postoperative pain was studied in surgical patients who underwent either abdominal patients or superficial patients surgery
15765,during anaesthesia no analgesic or narcotic drugs were given
15766,immediately after surgery an intravenous infusion of ml normal saline or saline with mg of diclofenac was administered over minutes under double blind randomized conditions
15767,the hour study period was started when the patients complained of pain or half an hour after the end of anaesthesia
15768,for pain relief during the study period mg of oxycodone was repeatedly given on demand
15769,the initial mean pain intensity values were significantly higher after abdominal surgery than after superficial surgery but there were no statistically significant differences between diclofenac and placebo groups
15770,the mean amount of oxycodone required after diclofenac was not significantly lower than after placebo mg vs mg after abdominal surgery and mg vs mg after superficial surgery
15771,the pain relief obtained with oxycodone was similar after diclofenac and placebo
15772,according to the present results prophylactic use of diclofenac does not significantly reduce the need for narcotic analgesics in the immediate postoperative phase in general surgery
15773,using the laser flare cell meter lfmc we have previously determined the intensity and pattern of post alt ocular inflammation
15774,inflammation peak occurs hours after alt and clinically relevant inflammation is seen in of pigmentary glaucomas pig of pseudoexfoliative glaucomas pexg but only in of primary open angle glaucomas poag
15775,we also showed that topical diclofenac reduced inflammation in all treated patients
15776,prostaglandins are thought to play a major role in alt inflammation and it is therefore logical to assume that nsaid are effective in that situation and will probably advantageously replace corticosteroids
15777,in order to assess the anti inflammatory effect of diclofenac drops voltaren ophtha we included a total of pig or pexg in the diclofenac and in the placebo group scheduled for alt in prospective randomized placebo controlled study
15778,visual acuity tonometry and lfcm flare measure were performed before hours days after alt
15779,topical diclofenac or placebo was given before and after alt and then qid for a total of days
15780,mean maximal flare increase was significantly less in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group ph msec v ph msec p less than
15781,flare increase compared to pre alt values was significant at and days after alt in the placebo group only p less than p less than no significant flare increase occurred in the diclofenac group

15803,duration of the treatment in all groups has made days
15804,obtained data testify that by the end of treatment full knocking over of a pain syndrome in the basic group is noted at of patients in control group only in of patients the pains have completely disappeared in a cervical spine
15805,thus therapy by biological preparations in a combination to a complex of special medical improving gymnastic exercises allows to reduce terms of knocking over of sharp clinical displays of an osteochondrosis of a cervical spine to raise efficiency of restoration of sensitive vascular muscular tonic frustration and also allows to avoid neuro surgical intervention at patients with hernias interspine disks
15806,cell culture studies have shown that nsaid may influence osteogenic activities of osteoblast cultures
15807,however these studies did not consider long term effects on differentiating cells
15808,the influence of voltaren with the non steroidal agent diclofenac on proliferation and gene expression of the osteoblast like cell line saos was investigated and days after incubation
15809,two days after h of incubation microg ml diclofenac reduced the proliferation and collagen type i expression while and days later no effect was found on either of the parameters
15810,in contrast microg ml nsaid has no effect on alkaline phosphatase expression days after incubation while and days later expression had been reduced
15811,lower concentrations and microg ml had no effects on the studied parameters
15812,brdu and mtt test showed that microg ml diclofenac reduced proliferative and metabolic activity
15813,lower concentrations or microg ml had a lower or no influence
15814,the findings indicate that the nsaid impairment depends on cellular differentiation stage and is not confined to the time during or immediately after nsaid incubation
15815,according to these results in vitro testing of drugs should be performed over a longer time period to detect possible long term impacts

16016,abstract since three new analgesic entities tapentadol immediate release nucynta diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules zipsor and bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension exparel were granted us food and drug administration fda approval to treat acute pain
16017,tapentadol immediate release is a both a mu opioid agonist and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain
16018,diclofenac potassium soft gelatin capsules are a novel formulation of diclofenac potassium which is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and its putative mechanism of action is through inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes
16019,this novel formulation of diclofenac allows for improved absorption at lower doses
16020,liposomal bupivacaine is a new formulation of bupivacaine intended for single dose infiltration at the surgical site for postoperative analgesia
16021,bupivacaine is slowly released from this liposomal vehicle and can provide prolonged analgesia at the surgical site
16022,by utilizing nsaids and local anesthetics to decrease the transmission of afferent pain signals less opioid analgesics are needed to achieve analgesia
16023,since drug related adverse events are frequently dose related lower doses from different drug classes may be employed to reduce the incidence of adverse effects while producing synergistic analgesia as part of a multimodal analgesic approach to acute pain
16024,diclofenac potassium liquid filled soft gelatin capsule dpsgc zipsor is a novel formulation of diclofenac potassium used to treat mild to moderate acute pain
16025,to investigate whether dpsgc mg provided significant reduction in pain intensity compared with placebo regardless of baseline pain intensity a post hoc analysis was performed of pooled data from two replicate randomized controlled trials nct and nct that evaluated the safety and efficacy of dpsgc in postbunionectomy treatment
16026,patients from the two randomized trials were assigned to one of two subgroups patients with baseline numerical pain rating scale nprs scores of or greater to less than and those with baseline nprs scores of or greater
16027,within each subgroup efficacy and safety of dpsgc was compared with placebo
16028,across the two studies dpsgc and placebo treated patients had baseline pain intensity scores ranging from or greater to less than while dpsgc and placebo treated patients had baseline pain intensity scores of or greater
16029,significantly lower mean hour nprs scores were observed in the dpsgc group regardless of baseline pain intensity p
16030,in both subgroups at least twice as many patients treated with dpsgc rated the study drug as very good or excellent compared with patients taking placebo
